Open source refers to freely available computer software and other products (mobile apps, hardware designs, etc.), the source code (i.e. the underlying programming instructions) of which is made available to the public and made freely available for use, modification, and redistribution. Open source software is often community-developed and encourages collaboration among developers in order to improve the quality and scope of the software. As a result, open source software is frequently released under licenses that allow anyone to use, modify, and redistribute the code for no charge. Open source development encourages transparency and leads to improved software quality and security, making it an important part of the modern technology landscape.
