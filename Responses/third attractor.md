A third attractor is a term used in dynamical systems to refer to an attractor which is structurally distinct from the two the two aperiodic attractors that were initially identified in the system, usually through the use of phase diagrams or bifurcation diagrams. It is a structure which exists in a complex system but may not be recognizable in simpler models. A third attractor can be a source of novel, emergent behaviors which underlie long-term change in complex systems, as distinct from the predictable, cyclic patterns associated with the first two attractors.
