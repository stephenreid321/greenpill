Network state is a measure of the current behavior of a network regarded as a system. This metric describes the values of the variables contained in the network such as packet delivery rate, packet latency, communication times, available link speeds, and other performance measures. It also examines the interactions between the participating nodes and their associated resources, as well as traffic patterns and network utilization. Network state is typically used to identify quality of service issues, monitor service-level agreements, and assess system security. In addition to providing visibility into the current operational state of the network, network state can also be used to predict network performance and anticipate network changes.
