Lunarpunk is a type of speculative fiction that is set in space, focusing on a distant future powered by advancing technology and anti-capitalist ideals. It emphasizes a return to a collective, cooperative society, often expressed through utopian or optimistic science fiction. It draws from various works, including cyberpunk, steampunk, and funkpunk, but is distinguished from them by its focus on self-engineering, DIY attitude, and transhuman themes. Lunarpunk is often credited with opening up a new world of possibilities for writers and filmmakers, allowing for powerful exploration of themes like identity and radical social change.
