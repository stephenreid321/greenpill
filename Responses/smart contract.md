A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. It consists of codes that can be stored and replicated on the computer systems of any two or more parties. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. These self-executing contracts can be used to exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman.
