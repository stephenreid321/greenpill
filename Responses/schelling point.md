A Schelling point is a concept first introduced by Thomas Schelling in 1960 which signifies an equilibrium between two groups in a given situation. It suggests that members of different groups tend to isolate themselves by choosing to congregate in their own community or reach a compromise between themselves and the other group based on the values, agreements or negotiations of the involved parties. If a number of different choices are available, but one stands out as the obvious choice, then it can be defined as a Schelling point. This concept is important and has been applied to problems in economics, philosophy, mathematics, and psychology.
