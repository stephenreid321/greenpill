Terrapunk is a subgenre of speculative fiction which combines science fiction, fantasy, and horror with environmental themes and an apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic tone. Exploring concepts of ecological disaster and technology-driven disaster, terrapunk emphasizes relationships between humanity, technology, and nature, often featuring a bleak glimpse of humanity's future as it grapples with technology and its relationship to the natural world. It typically presents a dystopian view, but also has potential to present a utopian vision of our potential future. With its core themes of environmentalism, disaster capitalism, and the aftermath of climate change, it offers narrative possibilities and commentary on our current relationship with both the climate and technology.
