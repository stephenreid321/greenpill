A public good is an economic concept referring to an item, service or resource that provides benefit to everyone, while being nonexcludable and non-rivalrous. In other words, it is a good that cannot be depleted by one person’s use, and that can be as easily accessed by one person as by another. Examples include knowledge, social services, clean air and water, national parks, and public transit. The concept of public goods is important for understanding the way in which public policy affects the level of economic activity, and for understanding the dilemmas of providing public goods in the context of limited resources.
