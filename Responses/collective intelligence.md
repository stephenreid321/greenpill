Collective intelligence, also known as collective cognition, is the capacity of groups of people to collaboratively use their knowledge, experiences, and mindsets to think, reason, and make decisions in order to solve problems or achieve shared objectives. It is the ability of collective systems composed of different individuals and/or technical components to act smarter than any individual or component performing alone. This is achieved by the interactions between the components and the exchange of information and knowledge through a distributed system. Scope and structure of the collective intelligence among the participants, its environment, and the interactions can be as simple or complex as necessary.
