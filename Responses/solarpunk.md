Solarpunk is an emerging genre of speculative fiction that invokes a utopian vision of societies driven by renewable energy sources, such as solar power. It reconsiders the traditional relationship between humanity and its environment, promoting resilience in terms of technological, social and economic development. Through artistic expression genres such as paintings, music and literature, solarpunk narratives explore the potentials of cooperation and regenerative technologies, emphasizing the need for equitable access to clean energy and sustainable architecture. Science fiction and cyberpunk are commonly seen as solarpunk's predecessors and inspirations, while eco-feminism, futures studies, and permaculture principles also inform the genre.
