foreign music ation on the pod today we have bobby dresser who is the general manager at the optimism foundation and we are talking about optimism retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding round two um optimism retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding round two is uh they're dropping 10 million op tokens on people who create [[public good|public goods]] in the optimism and ethereum ecosystem they are going to be uh going to so the idea behind retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding is that it's easier to know in retrospect and retroactively which [[public good|public goods]] were actually good um and so what if we created an infrastructure for dropping tokens on people who had created [[public good|public goods]] for the world and then over time as people start to expect that they'll be rewarded for contributing to [[public good|public goods]] that shifts the game theoretic incentives of the world's agents in order to contribute to the [[public good|public goods]] it takes privatized capital and it gives them a business case for investing in [[public good|public goods]] projects on the assumption that they will get an exit one day so man i'm just so bullish on retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding and uh i guess you could say i'm optimistic about it um so i i view optimism and gitcoin and clr fund and giveth as creating this pluralistic stack that is going to help [[public good]] eyes the world using crypto rails and i'm just so bullish on the fact that optimism retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding rounds two is happening right now so um bobby and i are going to cover the why the what and the how of retractive [[public good|public goods]] funding round two in this episode and i think it was a really important one because optimism is doing really important work in creating a more regenerative crypto economic world so um really fun episode i think you're going to enjoy it without further ado i'll give you bobby dresser from the optimism foundation enjoy coordination the glow dollar is a news table coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty goes down glow is a dollar backed non-profit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company glo is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe reserve to give directly's basic income program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past with glow you can reduce poverty just by holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glodollar.org greenpill that's gro dollar dot org slash greenpill working in web3

go to connect.opolis.co bankless to get started and if you're going to eat denver make sure to stop by the office booth or attend their future of work summit hosted by opus bobby what's good what is up kevin too much really excited about retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding round two so give us the what why and the how what's what's going on yeah i'm excited about it too and i'm happy to be here so retro pdf number two retro retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding round two so um retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding is this concept that optimism is putting a lot of time and effort and love into it's not optimism specific um i think folks in the bitcoin universe are familiar with that idea as well but it's something that we're really leaning into to both grow our ecosystem and bring about the future that we're really excited about so retro pdf is basically this idea that it's easier to look back at what was useful than it is to make predictions about what will be useful in the future so there are a lot of reasons this basic idea is applicable but very often we spend a lot of effort trying to predict whether a group of people or whether a project or whether some amount of effort will have positive returns to a community or to a business going forward what retro pgf does is flip that around and say if we look back at the past quarter or look back at the past week or look back at the past decade what work made a difference over that time period you can actually see oh 10 000 people use this [[open source]] project or this teacher educated yeah i don't know 50 people who won nobel prizes and you can actually just measure the outcomes of that work as opposed to trying to guess how something will go in the future so how this applies to the optimism universe is that um optimism cares very deeply about funding [[public good|public goods]] we are on this mission along with the rest of our crypto family to as i like to think of it kind of expand the diversity of human coordination systems and scaling ethereum is a really big part of that so at its core optimism is trying to make more block space available so we can bring about this new censorship resistant economy and sort of coordination system but taking that one step further we think in order to get there we need to build a profit motive for the production of [[public good|public goods]] and to bring about that profit profit motive we use retro pgf so long-winded abstract spiel but basically this is the second version of that experiment that we're running it's a rather complicated thing to implement right the idea might be simple but there are a thousand variables in each round and so rpgf2 is our our second experiment where we're tweaking some of those variables and trying to see how that affects the outcomes that it creates amazing so um i think i've heard carl talk about this carl flourish one of the founders of optimism talks about like building a world in which it's as profitable to build [[public good|public goods]] as it is to launch a vc back startup and then once you have that world then the whole capital allocation infrastructure that's you know funding the next pets.com or photo sharing app you know stuff that silicon valley funds can actually be pointed at [[public good|public goods]] because that capital now has a belief that they can have returns so the retroactive [[public good|public goods]] kind of creates a credible promise of an exit for the [[public good|public goods]] that people care about and then once people realize that they can start making investments in the present in [[public good|public goods]] assuming that they have a credible path to exit in the future so it kind of shifts the game theory of of [[public good|public goods]] did i get that directionally right at all a hundred percent yeah there's there's some really exciting stuff in that exact concept that i think is um super powerful and can change the game for people who are building [[public good|public goods]] whether that's [[open source]] software or in the long term hopefully [[public good|public goods]] beyond crypto beyond technology in general that's the that's the dream yeah those things should be investable right those people should have the chance at an exit because oftentimes those types of contributions are providing more impact to society and we just historically don't fund them whether that's again the maintenance of [[open source]] software or whether that is the type of effort that makes a local community better or the type of global effort that makes our climate better there are a lot of ways where this kind of lack of symmetry and funding opportunity um manifests yeah um so i want to camp a little bit more on the theory in the in the vision and then we'll get into the actual retroactive yeah in the ground too um people who are watching on video will see behind me i have this uh this crypto art made by art by nelly it was this amazing uh crypto artist and um it's it's called ethers phoenix and this is this idea that carl flourish has had about the game theory of retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding on ethereum i'm wondering if you could take a swing at explaining uh at at talking about ethers phoenix yeah for sure so um ethers phoenix is this basic idea that um in the long term there is a like a a i i don't want to use the word utopia that might sound too grandma z but there's a utopian state where public where the production of [[public good|public goods]] is rewarded and there are a lot of different paths to get there there is a there is a lot of different effort that has to take place in order to reach that future state and very simply the effort to bring about that future state is itself a [[public good]] and so if you take those two pieces of of logic like future state where the production of [[public good|public goods]] is well funded and any work to get to that future state is itself a [[public good]] you can basically think of the work to bring about ethers phoenix as something that itself would be rewarded so it's like in my head this little recursive um motivation to create that end state that we're working towards and it's the idea that like those types of projects whether that's retro pdf number two whether that's something you're doing tiny in your own world whether that's creating the greenpill podcast whether that's telling your friend about this type of idea all of that work will be rewarded in this future state and it's like a kind of a reason to keep going if you think we'll get there yeah what i like is that it takes this idea of retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding that's like 10 syllables but it takes it takes the idea of the game theory of retracted [[public good|public goods]] funding and it makes me feel like like i'm in like a marvel comic or something like that ethers phoenix is rising from the ashes of the coordination tools of ethereum and giving birth to itself and it's a benevolent sort of like angel because it rewards [[public good|public goods]] that people actually care about so it's like this recursive algorithm um and i just think it's like it's really elegant and um you know depending on who i'm talking to if i'm talking to economists i'll talk about retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding and the mechanisms but if i'm talking more general audience we can talk about retro or ethers phoenix and and they're totally complementary yeah it's it also makes this abstract idea you know when you meet someone and you feel like there's something simpatico you like kind of feel like you're on the same wavelength you're like oh all right we get each other in a certain way this kind of makes that feeling a little bit more concrete because it's like oh we're actually on the same secret or not so secret team like we're actually it's not just a vibe that we caught it's actually us working toward the same long-term abstract thing and so that type of idea is like a little ear worm that i think i mean even creating the concept of ethers phoenix itself helps bring about ethers phoenix so i don't know how how far down the recursion you can go before my head falls off but uh stuck too deeper yeah yeah it helps like prevent the kind of defeatism that um is increasingly prevalent not only in crypto but i don't know globally and um that sort of thing is huge for for continuing optimism yeah um it's funny that you just name dropped the name of the project that's doing this optimism yeah um but medically i like that um so so yeah uh let's let's get let's actually get into the mechanism so retractive [[public good|public goods]] funding round two when is it how do people participate how does it work and and um you know how much how much capital is going to be allocated during this during this round yeah for sure so we are recording this conversation on tuesday january the 24th we are smack in the middle of the nomination window so uh the way retro pdf runs very simply is there is a declared scope so at the outset of the round we'll say [[public good|public goods]] and contributions that fit these criteria are eligible for funding in this round so right now that's a set of guidelines that the optimism foundation sets in the very early stages of the optimism collective and eventually that'll be a scope that is set by our governance community by the collaboration between token house and the citizens health so we can bookmark the kind of rabbit hole of optimism governance for a second and just say there's a scope for the funding round that's set at the outset and some time passes and maybe in that time people put in a lot of effort to build stuff that fits in that round scope or in the case of this round because it's been so long since round one there's been tons of positive contributions that have happened over the past year so we basically said here's the round scope we know there's tons of stuff that fits in here so we're going to move right through the next couple stages of the process next stage is this nomination window so anybody on uh uh on the planet earth or beyond the planet earth anybody can nominate a project for funding and so the way you nominate a project is you read the scope and you're like hey this opens there's dependency that i use every day probably fits within that scope or hey i read this educational resource about optimism and i realize there's this education category so i'm going to nominate that thing we've got a couple threads open on our governance forum and that's where anyone can show up and write a pretty short description to nominate the project for funding um the scope of this round two i should add is funding [[public good|public goods]] that support the development and the usage of the op stack and so we're starting with this pretty small concentric circle to say all of the things that we rely on to make optimism go should be funded and that includes the infra and the dependencies that the optimism code base itself relies on that includes the tooling and utilities that developers on the optimism core development team or building applications in the optimism ecosystem use and that includes education things that bring awareness of optimism to a broader audience whether that's technical education or social education etc um so in any of those categories you can nominate something and that nomination window at least for this round will run two weeks ending on january 31st we do a little bit of like program management admin to make sure we've got info from all of those projects which is pretty important right we want to make sure we're funding the right people and everyone feels safe and good about that we also collect a little bit of information from them and we'll probably come back to this in a second but there's a there's a big variable here around what info we require from the project and what info we present to voters when they're making their choice so we've got all these products nominated we've kind of collected some information we've got a pretty um consistent template for everybody and then we enter this voting window so voting on retro pgf is done by a set of people who are called citizens so optimism has two houses of governance token house which is standard token weighted voting so the op token circulates freely and people who have ob tokens delegated to them can choose to vote in the token house governance and they're responsible for a set of decisions around grants funding and uh governing certain attributes of how the sequencer works and approving protocol upgrades things like that second house of optimism governance is called the citizens house and their primary responsibility is voting on retro pgf it's voting on the allocation of [[public good|public goods]] funding so we are gradually ramping up this concept of the citizens house and in retro pgf round two we've got about 90 people who are from all different backgrounds and experiences who will be voting on how to allocate 10 million op tokens over the full set of projects that were nominated um so we covered a lot of ground and there's a lot of uh a lot of detail in there but that's the very basic like run of show of of how we go start to finish after the voting takes place um funding's distributed to those projects then we'll run retro pgf round three with a new scope maybe it's broader maybe it's more specific a slightly broader set of citizens um and keep going until we've funded all of the impact on the world and brought everybody into the new fold of how this economy should work right well i just think it's so elegant how with optimism's bicameral governance structure you've got the token house which is like motivated by capital and then you've got the citizens house which is kind of motivated by these values and you're kind of creating this economic system that um the the sum is greater than than each of those parts they're they're they're kind of really very um there's a healthy tension there but but i think that together it makes the the community stronger and so um the bicameral governance is something that vitalik has talked about as a big innovation to make sure that capital is values aligned and that values uh the values alignment has the power of capital and wow 10 million op tokens that's like 20 million bucks right 21 million dollars as of as a recording it's a it's a big chunk of tokens and if you look at the initial allocation of um like the initial tokens applied there's a huge portion of it that's allocated for retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding in addition to a portion of protocol revenue that will go to [[public good|public goods]] funding um and so we really care about this not only as a as a new type of economy that we want to prove out but also because it's a it's a growth strategy we earnestly believe that funding [[public good|public goods]] will make optimism an incredibly vibrant and successful crypto ecosystem because it'll be easier to build on it will be easier to learn about it will be easier to participate in as a technical or non-technical person it's like music um it's not just altruism like yes we think it's good for it's the way the world should work but we also think it's a really crucial ingredient to to growing this this fabric community yeah i love that alignment of i mean this is what makes optimism such a special place uh to me um in in the ecosystem and such a leader is that it's got the values alignment of being focused on [[public good|public goods]] and it's also got the capital to deploy on this stuff uh and one without the other doesn't have the same sort of effect but the synthesis of the two is is what makes it pretty exciting to me for sure yeah and i'm glad you brought up some of vitalik's writing because i think one of the just like personally one of the most interesting things about working on this project is that space between some of the abstract ideas around how these systems could work like ethers phoenix or a bicameral governance system where certain governance rights are shared between these two parties and you've had carl on this podcast i think you might have had ben also on this podcast and they are incredible thinkers and some of the most brilliant minds that i've come in contact with and thinking about how to design these big picture systems and one of my personal favorite things is that like really messy space where you're going from this pretty pure and elegant idea and you're taking it into the messy stage of implementation so it's like all right retrophgf that's a pretty clean concept but when you break it down and try to like make it actionable and execute on it it's really messy and there are a thousand little variables from the product design of the ui to the way we distribute voting badges to the specific algorithm we're using to count votes to the way that we word the scope there's so many variables that actually affect the outcomes and uh it's just like a joy to kind of work through that and iterate towards the actual outcomes that we're that we're working on i think there's so much fascinating stuff in there that it's um been really fun to to play with that optimism yeah oh man we could go we could dive in on those variables but we could also look well maybe i'll establish i want to establish like a macro view and then maybe we can dive in on some of those variables um so i've kind of got this view of um a holonic view of how we're going to fund [[public good|public goods]] using crypto in the future and like a whole lot is just a whole that's comprised of parts like um i i am a whole lot of my cells and my organs and me and you together are a whole lot of this episode of the podcast in the ethereum community is a whole lot that's composed of the ethereum community and um inside of each hold on uh in order to fund the [[public good|public goods]] of that whole on in this case the ethereum community or the optimism community you need um funding but then once you have the funding the question is how do i distribute it to the most legitimate [[public good|public goods]] and so you've got the mechanism is the other composite part of the whole on and so um in gitcoin's case the funding source is really generous um donors optimism included that give to get coin and then you have [[quadratic funding]] as the mechanism that distributes it's the most legitimate [[public good|public goods]] and then within optimism you've got sequencer fees and the initial token allocation as the funding mechanism and then you've got or sorry the funding source and then the mechanism is retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding um and and i think some sort of [[quadratic voting]] correct me if i'm wrong uh it will take place there we're actually not using [[quadratic voting]] this in round two as sort of a test to see how it affects the voting outcomes but yes right i like that that distinction right the funding comes from somewhere and then there's a decision there's like this like decision module where funding has to get distributed well yeah and then like the last thing to build on top of that is like you start with funding the [[public good|public goods]] of the optimism community and then you can fund the ethereum uh like i almost look at this as like an expanding the whole on of which [[public good|public goods]] were funding so you start with optimism community and then you since optimism kind of is ethereum then you expand out to ethereum [[public good|public goods]] and then we could go to all [[open source]] software and we're creating this ethers phoenix retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding loop at expanding expanding amounts of humanity and then you eventually do from all [[open source]] then all digital and then and then you can kind of retroactive [[public good|public goods]] fund the world out from there and that's like the incremental iterative approach the loop that i would like to see happen in the world and and one of the things i think is cool is like this modularity of like oh there's going to be a pluralism of mechanisms and funding sources that's going to allow that to expand outwards and that's what makes kind of like bitcoin's work and optimism's work uh complementary you know in a way and there'll be certain mechanisms that are really good for some communities um but won't be good for other communities and so that forkability um of like that allocation stack i think is really important so i don't know that's that's my macro take on on how retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding and other mechanisms expand out to like really create outcomes for humanity but i'm curious how that resonates with the optimism vision 100 yeah that's exactly the the dream is like running this process enough until we can build the escape velocity to expand beyond our own optimism community beyond our own ethereum community beyond even the the crypto community and i think it's this balance between like these incredibly large dreams and then the humility to know that we can't like take one giant step and say right optimism is able to fund [[public good|public goods]] across the entire globe we're doing it all right now it's like we know that it's possible but we know we have to take a lot of small steps to get there and that's sort of what i mean about all these infinite variables like there's a lot of ways i think we could design a bad round and and i think we're very clear-eyed that even in round two there's probably going to be a lot of constructive feedback from projects who are getting funded from voters from community members making nominations where they say hey these things work for me and these things didn't work for me and by giving ourselves little bite-sized chunks we like i think dramatically increase the chances that we arrive at a process in the longer term that actually works for the impact that it's trying to fund because who knows it will learn even when we grow from a scope that says we're funding [[public good|public goods]] that support development of ethereum and optimism or we're funding [[public good|public goods]] for the thai crypto community we've got a giant thai community out there like the scope of the funding round will change the mechanics of the round the makeup of badge holders will change it and trying to remain very music um like pragmatic that we don't know all of the right answers for all of those different uh different steps yeah i mean i think the iterative approach is a is a great one you know they say startups are kind of like contained explosions um and maybe like each of each i know like get coin round is just like an experiment with a new mechanism or a new parameter and then you iterate towards the global maxima of coordination um it through just trying stuff and and you got to get it wrong in the iterations in order to in order to learn and so um yeah that iterative loop is is really i think very cool for proving this out but what what makes me really excited about this vision is that if it works in optimism then you can imagine um other l2s or defy or dow projects doing um retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding um or maybe you know we reach a place in which crypto is saturated um the world and you know a local a local community uh could just take the playbook that optimism uses to fund its [[public good|public goods]] and it could fund its [[public good|public goods]] using that exact same stack and play like it's forkable and [[open source]] right so all you need is like a concerned citizen that can fork the mechanism and implement it in their own community for this to like you know it's like a dandelion that's like the sort of like the seed spread from there that's an excellent excellent image i think that's super true and i'm interested to see how it takes off i mean i think bitcoin has played a huge role in that dandelion effect and in spreading this way of thinking and um helping people digest the meme that crypto and really all technology is built on [[open source]] and that there's this obligation not only like a kind of just obligation but also is like an effective way to make sure things are safe and usable to to continue to fund [[public good|public goods]] and so i don't know two is stronger than one and five is stronger than two and so we'll see how how far the dandelion goes yeah well um you know like thank you for saying that about getcoin i just want to share a little story um and that's the in the heart of the last bear market um when eth was at eighty dollars uh get coin was figuring out what it wanted to be wandering around in the abyss trying to figure out what we wanted to do when we grow up and we got on a call with carl and jing from the optimism team then it was called uh plasma group i think um and and they donated 100k they were our first uh donors to get coin that wasn't the ethereum foundation and they told us we really love what you're doing with [[public good|public goods]] and we have i think it was like 95k left in this entity and we want to donate it to the [[public good]] and keep up the great work and it was like for me it was like a warm fuzzy because i i like an application level developer but carl and jaeger like deep game theory like protocol developers just like i don't know it it anyway so um it feels like optimism or uh carl and jing could sort of like slingshot get coin through the last bear market um and i and i hope that bitcoin can pay it forward to you because um optimism in many ways is carrying the torch on on [[public good|public goods]] funding um and now we've got a pluralism of [[public good|public goods]] funding mechanisms and funding sources and that's that's what's cool like that's client diversity city but for [[public good|public goods]] funding sources and i think that that's really exciting to me that's all said um yeah i i have had some back and forth with folks on the bitcoin grand sub team folks like chase um and others michelle etc um and i have kind of gotten bit by this by this hype that y'all are building and building out sort of this central repository for uh if you'll permit me a moment of showing uh bitcoin like building out a central repository for projects that are accepting or looking for [[public good|public goods]] funding right because as we expand the number of communities that are interested in sending resources to these folks it's like you could either multiply the operational cost by the number of projects that are trying to send funding to [[public good|public goods]] or you can create this little [[schelling point]] this little this mod this like hub that builds [[network effect|network effects]] so that every time a new community pulls some folks online they accumulate into this central [[public good|public goods]] funding hub and makes it easier for projects it makes it easier for funders i think it's a really compelling and just like a smart move to help this thing take off a lot more quickly so i'm very on board with that direction i'm excited to see where it goes yeah likewise um well i think that what's cool is this just this like practical pluralism of we talked about bitcoin and optimism but giveth is doing it clr fund is doing it doing good is doing it and it feels like building a movement together and i would really like for you know right now the last markets the first the 2017 market cycle was icos the last market cycle felt like it was d5 and nfts and like dows are like on the low kind of happening but i would really like for there to be a cycle where like people are really excited about [[public good|public goods]] and coordination mechanisms in the future and i don't i don't know if we can beam that into existence but the fact that there's a pluralism of us doing it uh here in 2023 means that there's at least some heat there i think we can meme it into existence and i'm glad you brought up that kind of uh that concept of upfront investment in [[public good|public goods]] because i do think that is the next sort of the next step to take the next big lever to pull and part of that includes running retro pgf reliably enough that investors can feel confident in that possibility of an exit it also i think benefits from as you mentioned this pluralism of other folks funding [[public good|public goods]] to think to uh increase the kind of confidence in in projects like this getting funded but that to me is the next like step function increase in the success of this system where if we can build a community of investors who understand that funding projects like this will actually be a long-term very smart economic move then it kind of curves up the the growth trajectory and i think there's a lot of exciting possibilities in there yeah i think it's like i think i was talking to david hoffman from bankless and i was explaining to him all the reasons why retractive [[public good|public goods]] funding was gonna change the way investors think about retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding he's like dude you can explain it to me but like when the first exit happens then that's when all the capitals gonna like go after and chase us and we need that visceral like totally you know that visceral first exit and then that'll change the game totally and that's what i mean by like the you know the the like gnarly implementation details right the concept is super clean but to get there it's like all right well we need to increase confidence by funding this many [[public good|public goods]] over this many rounds we need to figure out the right investment structure like is there a hyper cert involved here are we pulling together the right community so that people can mean each other into participation in the system there's a lot of like um both social and technical questions that have to be answered even with a hypothesis even if it's not the final answer to kind of test our way towards making any of this happen but one of the things that you said that i really want to camp on because you know i believe in this in this like outer loop but you know clearly i'm greenpilled i'm like episode 100 of these but like for for the people who aren't greenpill yet and like they tune out the [[public good]] stuff as just like this hippie dippy granola uh coming out of boulder colorado kevin's talking about [[public good|public goods]] thing again i just want to camp on the fact that you said that it's about [[public good|public goods]] but it's also a growth hack for the optimism ecosystem so the same mechanism pointed at um optimism as a growth hack is a mechanism for [[public good|public goods]] funding in the wider world just when you apply it at a different aperture and and to me you know optimism wanting to grow its developer community is not that dissimilar from like a local town like boulder wanting to grow its community of engaged citizens who are like i don't know making a downtown livable and um making sure that you know you could point that same mechanism at uh [[open source]] software and build [[public good|public goods]] for like the npm python ecosystem and so to me that's what makes me insanely bullish that we're going to get to this point where we're going to have this [[public good|public goods]] exit thing is because um in the meantime you can just sell this stuff to marketing departments that are trying to build their crypto ecosystems or to like local governments you know i'm painting over a few details here but but i just want to make i guess the point i'm trying to make is that this isn't just like a moral argument that like [[public good|public goods]] are good and we should fund them because people who contribute to [[public good|public goods]] are good it's actually like the business objectives of a lot of crypto can use these mechanisms to build their ecosystems [[public good|public goods]] and i think that that's that's what's going to bridge us to this point where [[public good|public goods]] are just like ubiquitous i don't know if you have any comments on that yeah i think that's a really important point and if if we even if we put crypto aside for a moment so way back in the day i worked at metamask which is this [[open source]] project and it got me interested in um the just the mechanics of building in public right you've got people screaming your issues you've also got people who pick up you know uh half-built thing and get it over the finish line and there's just like all these dynamics and making that possible and from there i went to work at github where almost all of the world a lot of the world's [[open source]] software lives and i worked on the team that is thinking about how to make the production and maintenance of [[open source]] software accessible and for lack of better word healthy and so that includes things like github sponsors github discussions um like onboarding even onto github things like that um and there's an incredible team there but we spent a lot of time thinking about the psychology behind people who contribute to [[open source]] software projects and i am consistently shocked that the modern world exists as it does today given the current state of [[open source]] development and funding because every single piece of software that you touch in your daily life has thousands of legos that are built for free that are maintained for free and that the software that you're using critically depends on to work and there is this like massive economic mismatch and sometimes that thing bites us in the ass right there's i don't know heart bleed or like the event stream hack that i guess is somewhat crypto related but the fact that that thing that type of thing where a free piece of software where the maintainer has has no economic incentive to maintain it and keep it safe other than well no economic incentive and probably a lot of personal incentives like pride or the sense of giving back the fact that that type of thing doesn't crumble much more often and bring down huge parts of our modern economy with it is continuously surprising to me and frankly a little terrifying and so yes we're talking about funding [[public good|public goods]] as a growth strategy for optimism but i also think funding [[public good|public goods]] like [[open source]] software is pretty critical for our modern worlds to continue to survive in the way that it does now and that's why we're really that's why i'm personally really keen on this idea extending beyond just optimism and just crypto because i don't know if the current status quo will be able to continue for so long and we've also thought about this with sponsors right there are there are we we started from a place of sponsors gaining traction with companies because they wanted the marketing boost right i as uh gripe a giant payments company want to give 10 million to [[open source]] every year because it looks good and that only goes so far right what we really try to do is connect that big budget company it's like thinking about funding [[open source]] software to the actual benefits they would get from funding it so for example if we're spending 10 million dollars on [[open source]] software we know that our stack is safer and we know that the security of those things that we're depending on is slightly higher than it would be if those projects were underfunded so in general with this whole concept and i promise my ramble is almost through but it's like helping people understand this stuff isn't just like you said a hippie dippy abstract like oh this like community impact should be funded it's actually we've built a house of cards and it's really not safe and if we want to make software that lasts and that's accessible to use and that can actually take us into the next chapter of wherever the world goes then funding [[public good|public goods]] and funding [[open source]] software has to be for that yeah you know this is where we started at bitcoin original mission was to grow [[open source]] actually it was push [[open source]] forward but then we were like [[open source]] doesn't need to push it's more like a garden you need to garden um and i'm reminded of this xkcd comic where you've got a bunch of little blocks that are all sort of leaning on top of each other and it the title is all modern digital infrastructure and at the bottom there's like this little django block that's that's entitled a project some random person in nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003. it's it's really pretty crazy um yeah and so yeah i'm i'm totally bought into the vision but like you know the interesting part for me is like how do we go from the game theoretic [[schelling point]] being everyone free rides to the game theoretic shadowing point being everyone coordinates and you know like we found this local maxima in which like gripe i think you called them the web 2 payments company is willing to uh is willing to spend some of their marketing budget to look good by supporting github sponsors but you know how do we go like where people aren't just anti-ing in for like for the optics of it but it but it's more of like a way of i know like just like a way of building in public or you know how do we make the selling point to be more deeper coordination and and i think that we're still trying to figure that out as an ecosystem right now but it makes me really bullish to see so much experimentation and um uh in in this space and hopefully we figured out in the next market cycle yes that's a that's i think that's the exact right question to ask and it's interesting to for me at least just to compare like optimism's approach and github's approach for github's approach is like somewhat social with sponsors and optimism's approach bakes i mean i guess it's still social because some of it exists at the governance layer but we're baking in this assumption this like this little channel for a portion of protocol profits to continually forever and ever go towards attractive [[public good|public goods]] funding and that's up to governance at a certain point and they will make the continuous choice again that balances the financial interests of token house and the more sort of like long-term interests of the citizens to decide how that funding is like how much and how that funding is distributed but it's a slightly more opinionated take it's like that thing exists as part of the system it's not just like an agreement that we're trying to strike with a bunch of business people so we'll see if it works yeah totally um well you know i also appreciate that you've left the crypto bubble you worked at metamask and and then you went to github sponsors and it almost feels like your role uh at optimism foundation is is combining what you learned in both of those places in order to create this like coordination megazord so um you know i appreciate that reality check as well for sure yeah i missed i missed the crypto and i had to come back but honestly i think it was the the specific vision of the folks at optimism and the like magnitude of what they're trying to accomplish that feels like that little beating heart at the core of crypto that's what i care about this movement for and we've accumulated this much larger troop and there's like you know some chaos and some things that i like kind of look away from and some like you know some people doing really brilliant novel stuff and i think at the core there's this group of folks with very strong values about how crypto can actually make the world better and give us different tools to coordinate with that can solve all sorts of problems and that's like i think um the the subset of the broader community that i that i love to play in and that's what pulled me back and one of the things that i got to say like going back to my point about like how do we make the game theoretic [[schelling point]] to coordinate not to defect and to support your infrastructure but um you know i also and like to the eye to this idea that vcs will actually fund the [[public good|public goods]] when they see there's an exit from [[public good|public goods]] um i just want to say that i think the optimism is is really special in turning the tide towards a more regenerative crypto economic internet because it's proof point i mean the l2 is a leading l2 uh the technology is sound and the ethos the fact that it's bundled with this ethos hopefully will be a part of that creation of this game theoretic [[schelling point]] towards more [[public good|public goods]] and like what i really want in the next market cycle is for the vanguard projects to not be this like dog  __  like the safe moons in the like i didn't even know the names of like of of these like meme coins that just pump and dump because if we can't like the the subtitle of the greenpill podcast or the book is like how crypto can regenerate the world and i want it to be crypto actually is regenerating the world in the next edition that we do and we don't get that without projects that are actually truly eating their decentralization in their region vegetables doing it and i think that optimism is sort of like leading um in in that way and you know hopefully we move from a market that's all just speculation to one that's more fundamentals and i think that projects like optimism really have strong fundamentals so uh just a recognition for you all that you're that you're sort of leading in improving that a more regen greenpilled web3 is possible and uh i don't know what your secret is but uh but i but i hope that you sprinkle some some optimism and some retro pdf and in [[public good|public goods]] on on the rest of the ecosystem before the next market cycle starts i appreciate that i think we have a long ways to go and a lot of work to do but i appreciate that nonetheless yeah well i'm like the tired curmudgeon after 15 rounds of [[gitcoin grants]] we're like passing the batana they're like yeah good luck with your next 13 rounds bobby um so i want to spend maybe a few more minutes talking high level about this world that you're trying to create and then we should probably stick the landing by by tangibly revisiting retro pgf round two so is there anything that i didn't ask you that that you want to say about retro pgf or optimism or the movement that y'all are building hmm i mean there's a lot that i could say i think that the the piece that we touched on a tiny bit that i just want to reiterate is like the commitment to um this being this gradual iterative process because i think oftentimes there's a little bit of distance between what people expect and how kind of progressive we're being with this so a lot of projects have gone right from uh or dev team building something to like full dao and there's a like just that leap in a moment and there's a lot of benefits to that right you just like hit that end state and you figure stuff out live but what optimism is trying to do is this much more gradual process because we know how hard the design of these systems can be and how much there is to get right if we're going to build something that actually works for a huge variety of stakeholders and participants and so we i've had this experience talking with a bunch of different community members where they expect things to be a certain way or they expect these certain types of decisions to be immediately you know voted on by everybody or they expect like um i don't know if like oh you're funding [[public good|public goods]] like why aren't we funding teachers in my hometown why aren't we funding clean water immediately like this type of uh get there tomorrow sort of mentality it would be ideal if those things were possible but we're just like really committed to taking it step by step and committed to being here for the long haul um and like we i certainly hope that folks hold us accountable to that commitment that each step we are taking feedback and making the system work better and we're learning from past experiences um but just i think it's a slightly different way of doing things than a lot of um existing projects out there have have taken and so i just wanted to like i guess touch on that again because it'll it'll take a while but i think it's the most likely path to lead us to a to a good system at the end of the rainbow the end of the rainbow um yeah i mean in my my version of this is like you can't let perfect be the enemy of good we wish [[quadratic funding]] was was funding local [[public good|public goods]] and things outside of the crypto bubble but um you know we just rewrote the entire not we but get coined out it just rewrote the entire stack to be decentralized and modular from a centralized monolith and that took like 12 months so it's it's it's actually uh rebuilding the infrastructure that can scale in that way and i gotta say that i think op stack wasn't was an inspiration for grant stack um you have this modular ecosystem that can be used to compose an l2 um and so you went like one level meta above just building an l2 with the op stack and i think that get coin from what i've seen of their strategy on the governance forums is like the same thing it's like building a suite of tools that can be used to compose a grants program and you can fork out uh the sequencer in l2 uh for another type of sequencer or on grant stack you can fork out [[quadratic funding]] for [[quadratic voting]] or i don't know maybe one day we'll build retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding into grant stack or something like that and so um you all have been an inspiration i i think for bitcoin as it's turned the corner from centralized monolith into decentralized modular and then you just have to iterate from there once you've got the right foundation and so um yeah it's it's pretty exciting for me to see it working at op stack and it gives me hope that uh the grand stack will work in the same with the same sort of decentralized modular strategy yeah there's a lot in there i think like a shout out i can take no credit for for the op stacks architecture and our upcoming release bedrock which is scheduled for feb but folks like carl and ben folks like proto and kelvin and kevin ho and all these folks who are cranking on making sure the system not only works to the quality that we expect but is designed in a way that can let other people build their own chains or experiment with a chain that has different characteristics i think is like very core to our [[open source]] philosophy right we want to build this thing and have it be licensed in a way that other people can take it and remix it and play with it and reassemble it in a way that works for them um but it also exactly like you mentioned applies to a lot of other different types of product it applies to our governance system it applies to these funding mechanisms and eventually we want to get to a place with retro pgf where we've got enough modularity that the iteration that we're going for can happen in parallel it can happen a lot more quickly it can happen more permissionlessly so that we're setting folks up to run their own rounds in ways that um are sort of more true to the local knowledge of their community unless about our opinions and how we want some things done there's all there's a lot in there but i'm i'm glad it's working out for you see other folks doing stuff like that as well yeah totally well uh let's come down from the matter and actually get to the object level so the nomination window for retro pgfron 2 is until january 31st at 1900 hours gmt and then the project opt-in deadline is february 14th and then the voting window is february 28th to march 14th so during east denver uh y'all it sounds like you'll be dropping bedrock uh and then also retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding will be happening so really excited for that um any comments on that and also how can people get involved in retro pgf round two you got a call to action for people yeah for sure the big moment to get involved is actually right now during this nomination window so if you've heard this and you've been like damn i know about this project or this person doing exceptional work or this resource that i've relied on a bunch these things are all great things to nominate for retro pgf round two uh we have a pretty big sort of commitment to this specific funding round there's 10 million op tokens going out and we've got a great stream of nominations coming in so far but i think the broader the set of folks who are nominating i think the better the outcomes will be so you can head to gov.optimism.io and there are a couple threads going on there where folks have been nominating projects over the past couple weeks and that nomination window will wrap up at the end of january on january 31st so um get get the nominations in while you still can and then we'll continue the rest of february kind of getting our acts together for this voting period and um i'm honestly really excited not only for the products getting funded but also for the retro experience of this round because that's what kind of propels us for round three so at the conclusion of round two we'll be announcing plans for round three and that's another exciting moment to get involved as we announced let's go you can kind of consider is there something i can do that fits within this kind of spec this umbrella of impact and then there'll be a period of time between round three announcement and round three voting where you can find some folks to build with get in contact with the optimism team and our deveral folks and um it kind of paired with uh the the right way to make impact um there's a lot of good stuff coming in for round three as well yeah excited for that um and will those links to to those uh resources will be in the show notes um are you all planning on doing this i think round one to round two was roughly nine months or 12 months are you planning on doing yearly or quarterly or you know what's what's the cadence are you all just kind of figuring it out very much want to increase the cadence so ideally there's not nearly as much of a time delay between round one and round two we've had a very busy year so i think that contributed to it as well but um like we mentioned with the way to get some of this investment off the ground running retro pdf regularly i think is going to be key to its success so you'll likely see the cadence of rounds um shorten we could even run parallel rounds in some future universe so um we want to make this ongoing process and really build up the muscle so that this can get super easy for our side and from the community side as well and then let's just end on what does this look like if you all are maximally successful uh my version of this is like it's a world where vcs fund [[public good|public goods]] the same way they do seed stage startups but like what does the world look like where you where you stick the landing on this i don't know let's say 20 27 or something like that so what you mentioned i think is a goal post along our our vision for success but it's not the end state i think the end state is that the the global economy or the many different versions of the global economy have built in a mechanism that funds [[public good|public goods]] that is not just taxes funding schools are doing the kind of like marginal things that at least i see happen in the united states maybe marginal's too strong a word i know there's tons of government funding that goes towards um supporting [[public good|public goods]] but the global economy takes note and starts to fund [[public good|public goods]] in a way where the profit to the individual is actually matching the impact that that [[public good]] has provided and that is something that i think is very easy to observe us not doing today if you think about the amount of social science research that shows that education is one of the most important things for driving positive life outcomes and then you look at the average public school teacher salary in the u.s and i think it's pretty easy to see a clear mismatch between the impact a good school teacher is providing and the amount of profit they're personally receiving is as part of it so maximally successful to me looks like a global economy that takes note from what optimism is doing and funds [[public good|public goods]] in a way that matches the impact they're having and isn't just a footnote on a budget yeah i i think that like for me what makes me really bullish is like these individual agent level incentives that exist in that world where um where people can work on the [[public good]] and and just like be financially rewarded for it and then what you get is this like game theoretic schelling pointer like movement from people working at like jp morgan so that they have to like be so they can pay the mortgage and pay for their kids education and health care and stuff to just working on [[public good|public goods]] um and you know the problem with like you know spending nine hours a day working at a big bank is that by the end of your the end of that you don't have any time left in your day you don't have any energy emotional energy to go fix the potholes or to go pitching in your community and so by pointing people's financial lives at [[public good|public goods]] instead of these like private uh privatized jobs um then then not only do you like create a better world um because all the world's agents are like working on [[public good|public goods]] instead of in their own like private capture things but um but like it just it just really creates a sea change in how people view um being a community citizen and being able to be a community citizen and pay your bills with that to me is uh is is really the bullet case for this so i'm so excited about what you're doing and i hope that get coin and super modular and optimism are are building this world together because uh it feels like one that i want to live in absolutely i appreciate you saying all that i have one little i have one little tiny story people permit me at the end let's do it yeah one of the questions that you sent over was just like the concept of how do you keep that how do you keep that optimism alive and um you work at a company named optimism well that's part of it that gets most of the way but it does actually get you all the way so the trick for getting the rest of the way is the greenfield podcast um i i i like have a very bad habit of biting my nails and so for the past years so i've been getting gel manicures where they put this stuff on your nails it's like so hard you couldn't even possibly bite through it with your teeth it's actually been very helpful at helping me kick my nobody habit but i'm saying all this because my ritual once a month go to the nail salon you can't really do anything because your hands are trapped by someone who's just right so um i'd pop in the greenfield podcast there's like some nice like calming music in the background get my little nail down so i can't be biting my meals anymore exactly there we go um and like it honestly did give me a moment of zooming out from furiously sending messages to my internet co-workers and forced me to kind of reconnect with like the amount of brain power in this space the amount of creativity the amount of i'm gonna say it again i'm so sorry the amount of optimism that exists in this space um and it it really honestly does help me kind of connect back to not only why we're doing this but also the the like gentle faith that we will be able to build a better future so thank you for making this podcast um thanks for having me yeah well hopefully we are one step uh closer to manifesting ethers phoenix by doing this episode and i appreciate you saying that alrighty bobby uh thanks again man and good luck on retroactive [[public good|public goods]] round uh too we'll be we'll be rooting for you thank you kevin good to chat music
