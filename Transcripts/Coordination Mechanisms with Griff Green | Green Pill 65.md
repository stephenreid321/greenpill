foreign music ation how you doing on the pod today we have griff green who is a founder of giveth and of common stack and we're actually not talking about those projects today what we are talking about is about 20 different mechanisms for doing better [[collective intelligence]] why are we talking about that well when you can do better [[collective intelligence]] you can do better collective resource allocation and that is a big deal when you're trying to fund the commons and you're trying to build a more regenerative financial system so we talk about existing mechanisms things like taxes and markets and voting all the good stuff that our democracies have had since the industrial era and then we blow it up into the information age and what is going to be possible with higher resolution democracy and mechanisms for determining our shared needs in the web 3 era let's give you a preview we do talk about [[quadratic funding]] since that's a web era mechanism for creating [[collective intelligence]] about what communities uh need and anyone who's following the podcast knows that i founded bitcoin and it's one of the biggest [[quadratic funding]] sites out there so uh talk about [[quadratic funding]] conviction voting retractive [[public good|public goods]] funding effective altruism hyper certs oh my gosh you just got to listen to the episode at this point because it is a doozy it is a marathon but we are talking about some really really really powerful mechanisms for funding the commons in this uh and and these mechanisms are what gives me so much hope about regen web3 we've got a higher density information space and we've got the ability to create decentralized [[collective intelligence]] and it just makes me so sure that we're going to be able to create a more regenerative financial system if uh we can channel talent in builders into regen web 3 and avoid uh regulation that stifles innovation and uh maybe attract a regulation that that keeps the fraudsters out so um more [[collective intelligence]] equals more commons resource allocation and that's what this episode is about griff and i have a marathon of 20 different uh mechanisms and i think that you're really going to enjoy this probably one of the best episodes that we've ever produced so without further ado i give you griff green and [[collective intelligence]] mechanisms enjoy

refi be sure to join the build with cello hackathon live now with a prize pool of over a hundred thousand dollars what's up griff gmgm um so really excited to have this conversation with you uh i posted a tweet a little bit earlier today in which we were talking about uh different mechanisms for collective resource allocation and basically the idea here is that if we want to fund the commons if we want to fund our collective goods and we have to figure out how to measure what collective goods we care about and in web 3 we can create more decentralized coordination mechanisms that fund the commons and uh you're you're the ultimate person to have on for this episode because of your work at giveth and token engineering commons so uh as a primer can you tell us about that before we jump in yeah i mean uh the goal of the common stack and token engineering comments and really giveth and everything that we're working on is to create markets which we'll talk about later around [[public good|public goods]] so that because we know that like the you know the collective is allocating resources to things that will create value for the collective but the problem is while the collective doesn't have any customers so business models won't work but i am firmly in i firmly believe that we can use markets that we can use economic systems with supply and demand to actually value that value creation and reward the value creation so that's that's what i'm pushing for token engineering commons was the first one and we used some interesting mechanisms to design that system and i'm excited to dive into more of them yeah so yeah the thesis is better [[collective intelligence]] but equals better collective resource allocation this is going to be a medley episode in which we're going to go through a bunch of existing mechanisms for [[collective intelligence]] and collective resource allocation we're going to go into some web era mechanisms and we're going to get into some up and coming web error mechanisms and what are the questions we want to ask for each mechanism uh what is it and where does it work well and where does it not work well feels like a pretty good question to ask any to them anything else you would add there yeah i think that's i think that's where we start okay you want to tee us off with an existing mechanism for collective resource allocation sure i thought this is great and iran actually shout out to neuron who threw this one in your twitter thread tithing tithing is the og resource allocation right tithing is the idea of hey everyone donate 10 of your wealth or some percentage of your wealth to the church or at least to non-profits in some way uh so that we can support [[public good|public goods]] and it's it's really simple the the great thing is that it's really simple uh what it's good at uh is you know um especially if it's paired with religion or some kind of belief structure it's really it's just really simple to execute oh i made this much money give 10 to the church what it's bad at well there's no feedback mechanisms uh it's there's no enforcement really you know it's kind of a donation so you don't end up necessarily you have to really maintain a strong culture to make it work it feels like that's an a way of allocating getting funding and you know the fact that i think it's connected to a religious body makes people feel compelled to give the money but it feels like there's no real checks and balances to make sure that the church or whatever group is administering the funds is actually giving it to the right groups other than maybe the optics of people seeing the capital deployed at a very surface level and they're happy with it or or they're not are there any other places where this works well or doesn't work well you know i mean i think it's basically donations right so it works well where donations work well which is ah you know when you see a need that really hits your hits your emotions you can just instantly give to it and especially with tithing you kind of have an excuse to give to it so i think it would work well especially for local programs on the ground smaller projects uh but in mass i don't see it as a successful strategy we're in all right are there any other existing mechanisms that we want to that we want to talk about well obviously taxes is like the main one this is what funds [[public good|public goods]] right now this is how collective resources are are allocated right now so uh there there's no um yeah we have to talk about it and and this is like force tithing with like a little bit more complication you know but it's almost the same thing except instead of to a church or uh you're basically giving it to the other church government yeah i'm gonna channel my inner eric voorhees here and say uh i did not consent to this taxation and taxation is threat uh eric taxation is theft uh and eric uh we of course that love eric because he's an og in the crypto space and uh he represents the libertarian argument really well um i think that there's really an interesting back and forth between the argument that taxation is theft um and this argument that that that's the a priority argument i did not consent to this and therefore it is theft but the consequentialist argument that i always see coming from like leftists is well when you give 20 to have a thousand x better world um you know without that 20 we wouldn't have the internet because we wouldn't have darpa we wouldn't have um we we wouldn't have the resource like our uh flight controllers and regulation and and roads and bridges and there's probably a bunch of stuff that we just take for granted here like i think the counter yeah we would have war and so the counter argument is like what it what it like i want to fund the part of the government that i care about the comments that i care about but i don't want like i want the part that funds that funds the pothole being fixed outside of my house but i don't want the part that invades iraq is is kind of the thing there yeah exactly i i mean the the real the real challenge of course is that power corrupts and in the end taxes just go to the centralized entity and they get to decide top down where it goes there's very little bottom-up feedback loops and the what feedback loops there are is basically voting you know and that happens what every two four years to sometimes six years a different different governments have different strategies so it's yeah it's slow and i don't it's the best honestly though it's the best we have like uh that exists right now it is doing yeah it's it's doing the most it's creating the most value collectively if it was the best we have then i think that would be a pretty short episode we'd be like all right taxes are the way let's call it yeah but uh we're gonna get into some novel mechanisms that solve some of the problems with taxes uh and you know i think taxes are the funding uh resource collection mechanism but the allocation mechanism is voting so let's talk about voting next and there's many different types of voting um the one that i'm thinking of as we're talking about allocating tax dollars is driven by majority rule and you've got this kind of two-party system where people are elected in a representative democracy there's certain issues that get kicked out to the actual citizens on a ballot box but for at least the most part in the united states where i live we've got a representative democracy where you elect a representative and then they via voting and then there's a second layer of voting where they've they are in hopefully informed one would hope and then they vote on where those out resources are allocated but you have sort of a capture problem where money to interest can go in and they can kind of capture uh the representatives so there's majority rule voting there's consensus-based voting which is basically we have to get absolute consensus everyone has to agree on something to move forward and there's a bunch of different subtypes of voting and i think it's clear to me that this pit is kind of in the traditional world paired with taxes as a way that resources are allocated yeah it's like this is the feedback mechanism for taxes and it's i don't know i think it's kind of pathetic uh at least the way we do voting now you know at its core voting should be signal aggregation it shouldn't be and it should have way better ux but that's not happening anytime soon i mean we're using the same voting mechanisms that we used before there was cars before there were trains you know like people were riding horses around and this is how they voted and somehow that's lingered well there's like i think a kind of like lindy effect to these things where you know the same reason people talk about bitcoin has been around for a long time and therefore it will continue to be around for a long time and i think that you know the counter argument to well it's it's old so we shouldn't use it is well it's old so it is trusted so we should use it um and and so there's a lindy effect i think to voting in in that uh what's the whole thing about democracy is it's the it's it's the best uh it's it's it's the best mechanism that we have like better than all the all the other ones i think i'm butchering that quote here yeah but uh i i definitely know what you're saying it's like the best of the worst options you know uh but i i hope that i mean i feel like at least this is what i'm in web 3 to do we can build a better way yeah well this is here this is the winston churchill quote democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others that have been tried well let's try more  __  winston that's what we're here exactly all right uh markets should we talk about markets next yeah of course yeah i mean it's a whole category of things but uh go ahead yeah well markets are are incredible i feel like markets have done the best for uh into for resource allocation in general but they're not great at collective resource allocation they kind of you know it's the the money game controls markets and you you're really always providing for customers markets require customers in general uh like at least if you're using profit as a [[schelling point]] then you need to have revenue costs and and so you know in the end you can use kind of excel spreadsheets to say hey i'll make money if i if i participate with this project and then everyone is using a similar spreadsheet to say hey we're all making money so coordination is effortless but then there's the classic you know market failures uh you know [[public good|public goods]] don't get funding very well through markets information asymmetry monopoly there's a lot of issues with markets but they work really well if you're just trying to get a cell phone you know yeah so uh for private goods markets are really good at capital allocation and basically the idea here is that you've got a distributed [[collective intelligence]] mechanism in which like say i wanna i'm just gonna use your example of a phone um then if there's enough aggregate demand for a phone then that will uh relative to the supply raise the price of phones in the market and therefore more suppliers will come online because of the incentive the increased margins to develop phones and this is a distributed on the system on the agent based level this is what what allows me to purchase uh an item that i want but on the systemic level there's kind of a balancing act between supply and demand and a [[collective intelligence]] mechanism that tells the market what to build and what to fund uh as long as there's a revenue model for producing an item then it'll be produced and i remember there's a story about uh after the fall of the ussr the uh one one of the leaders of of the ussr coming over to to the united states and going into a grocery store and just being so impressed by the variety and the diversity of goods that were available in the united states with the market-based capitalist uh based economy so it creates anything that there's consumer demand for backed by buying pressure it's able to produce those goods yeah and and and it enables innovation right it really because people can be like i i think there will be demand for this and if they can convince an investor that there will be demand for it they can try to create a product that no one's asking for like this smartphone no one asked for a smartphone right and but people thought someone uh you know the the crew that made the smartphones actually it's general magic back in the day in the 90s were making these things and no one wanted them they failed uh but the people who started that project actually ended up eventually the market wanted it and they produced it yeah well you know and there's sort of like the capitalist gambit where uh where basically if you ask people what they would have want wanted then they would have set a faster horse that's a henry ford quote who of course invented the model t and the audio mobile and so there's there's kind of like a um it's almost like a capitalist evolutionary market-based x prize uh at the that encourages innovation and um you know one of the things that kind of is at the tip of my tongue as we move into novel mechanisms is what if we could get the [[public good|public goods]] funding that comes from uh the uh the scale of [[public good|public goods]] funding that comes from something like taxes but with the accountability that comes from something like markets so a feedback loop around funding of [[public good|public goods]] that to me feels like the the holy grail when i look at uh these existing mechanisms that we've gone through absolutely and and the coolest thing about markets is that it's win-win nobody is losing tithing taxes and voting mean you know these are like there's losers in that game so if you vote yes or in that and but the nose win you lose right taxes taxpayers pay and you know and then the people who don't pay taxes they all they all get the same benefits so uh but markets there are no losers you know uh i mean in the money game there's losers but with markets if you're creating value you win which is amazing yeah i mean i think that one uh criticism sub market that i'll add is a counterpoint is this idea that if i am at doing my fiduciary duty uh as the shareholder uh or a management team of let's call it a widget factory uh i'm trying to produce as many widgets as as low of a cost as possible and sell them as much of a high high cost as possible for my shareholders um i'm selling them on the open market i'm going to want to reduce that price as much as possible and so i want to externalize the cost of producing that widget as much as possible and so if i'm creating a toxic sludge or something as a side effect of of or any other externality uh then then uh i have an incentive to externalize that harm to the commons and i think that that's another valid criticism of of market-based mechanisms and and and the real problem is that the the commons doesn't have a market to push back right it's like there's a market for producing those widgets but like you said there's maybe the widget factory owners have a fiduciary duty to pollute the river because if they just spent five thousand dollars a month to get rid of their pollutions ethically then you know they would lose money and and the shareholders could actually sue them but it's because there's no market for a clean river if if if the people actually if there was a market for the clean river then those two markets could compete uh just like uh if the widget needs needs uh you know lithium and laptops need lithium they have to compete on the market price of lithium if the if there was actually a market for uh pollu using this river uh the value of this river in various various places then they would have to compete for you know the use of that resource yeah yeah i love it anything else to say about existing mechanisms before we move on to some more web era mechanisms i'm excited to build new things i think we can do better so i mean i guess i'll just comment on the category of web-based mechanisms before we dive into the specific mechanisms and i'll say that what i'm excited about is providing the scale of funding that could come from uh something like markets with the legitimacy and the public goodsness that comes from taxes uh and coordination and so like that type of coordination so it really feels like we're on the search for how do we move democracy into the web age going from the industrial era where we had like a low resolution environment information resolution environment to creating a high resolution picture of citizens preferences for what kind of [[public good|public goods]] that they want and then routing more funds to the thing to to the results of those mechanisms so it feels like as we move from the industrial age to the information age there's a real opportunity to democratize economies and to create higher resolution pictures of what [[public good|public goods]] people want which hopefully once we have that picture of what people want that [[collective intelligence]] routes more allocation to them are there any other like any thing to say about the category of web-based mechanisms before we get into them no other than i feel like this is where the innovation starts and uh and and i'm i think that these are actually these are the less successful ones right the ones that have allocated major capital that's that's what we're going to start with yeah all right well i'm going to start off with one where i'm the most confident and that's in [[quadratic funding]] i don't know if you've ever heard of [[quadratic funding]] griff no never uh please tell me uh so basically this is an idea by glenn weil an economist at microsoft and vitalik buterin who is the lead at the ethereum foundation and it is a mechanism in which you have a crowdfunding campaign that is allocated dollars from a central matching pool and those dollars are allocated on the basis of which projects are more democratically supported as opposed to the ones that more capital goes into like one-to-one funding uh is inherently plutocratic because it's driven by the the the needs of capital so if you raise a grant that has a hundred dollars from 100 contributors and i raise a grant from a a a project has a hundred dollars from one contributor you'll get 99 of the matching pool and i think that what's really cool about that is that we've built a [[collective intelligence]] mechanism that routes to a route uh money to where the the poor and the many have a preference over the rich and the few and of course uh you know the coolest thing as someone who is involved in get coin and [[gitcoin grants]] is built on top of [[quadratic funding]] is that you can give a dollar and depending on how democratically supported your grant is then it can be worth ten dollars or a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars uh worth of funding for that project and and that really gets people off their butt to donate to their favorite grants which like you they're giving a dollar but really they're building an aggregate signal of what [[public good|public goods]] want to be funded within that ecosystem so there's a bunch of problems with this civil attacks making up accounts is one of them how do you raise the matching pool is another but uh you know bitcoin is built on [[quadratic funding]] and uh i've seen it kind of go from zero to 72 million dollars worth of funding for [[open source]] so uh that's the one that that i think that i'm most familiar with anything to say about [[quadratic funding]] griff i i think it's amazing and it really starts to make you know people who are donating don't even feel like it but they're kind of voting you know and that's it makes voting fun uh and it also raises more money i i just i like um you know the simple way i think of [[quadratic funding]] [[quadratic funding]] is that because it also matters how much you donate so it's kind of like mitigating a plutocratic methodology which would be donating right where the the matching funds would normally be plutocratically matched more more donations get more matching and it's mitigating the plutocratic method with uh like a one person one vote um like style like an identity right uh so civil protection basically so i i think that's super cool yep so like any mechanism uh it works well in some places and doesn't work well in others let's move on to another mechanism do you want to tell us about conviction voting next sure yeah and and uh that i knowing that we have this google doc we're going through this that's why i kind of brought up that initial thing with uh [[quadratic funding]] because uh conviction voting mitigates uh plutocracy in a similar way is [[quadratic funding]] except it does it with time instead of uh one person one vote it's like if if you have more tokens you have more say but uh the the even if you just have a minority share you can still pass a large proposal with with it just takes more time for it to pass so it's uh it uh it's just like voting where there'll be a bunch of proposals but instead of having like a two-week time limit where you say yes or no uh all the proposals are competing against each other and you allocate your tokens to the ones that you like them most and there's kind of a the conviction voting comes from the big brains behind block science like michael zargham was implemented at one hive mostly by sam and gabby uh and will j griff and those guys uh put put it all together so that when you're it works really well if there's a lot of proposals competing against each other and a clear budget of how much you want to allocate uh in a given time then conviction voting is a great solution and actually it's also been augmented uh so that it can be more of a streaming approach so the more tokens that are behind instead of the proposal passing like in conviction voting the tokens kind of sit behind a proposal and you can take them on or off at any time but then it gains conviction uh the longer the tokens sit there and eventually once it meets the threshold which is based on of how much money it's asking for all that money goes to the person asking for the money with automatic fund dean which is this new augmentation of it instead it's like there's a constant stream to all of the proposals that are requesting funds that have tokens behind them and you can kind of measure you can kind of change the rate that's going of funding to the different proposals so it's kind of like radical drips but with a token behind it where you're voting on how to allocate the funds of the collective funds so i mean it seems like the powerful thing here is that i can take my tokens which represent my share of some dao or some resource and i can put them into a bucket and over time conviction is developed by the number of tokens times the amount of time that it's been in that bucket and that gives some signal to the system that uh this is a good proposal um and so the more the more money and the more time that it has been in that system than the more uh we can have conviction that that people actually care about that thing and i think what's really cool is that um i think we looked at when back when i was a bitcoin dao we we looked at conviction voting as a way of doing um budget proposals where instead of having this quarterly budget where it's like yes or no you either get this amount of tokens or you don't we could just take conviction on the causes that we care about and then you know say instead of getting a hundred thousand tokens for this big quarterly budget process i could just take a certain amount of tokens and if like say i need to like pay for pizza or like laptops or something like that then um for smaller amounts of funding it's such a lower risk way of creating a decentralized market for which causes are good and and so i could take conviction on those things and there would be a bucket of money that no one has to go through this big budget process to get and they could get it through conviction voting so that's a plus of conviction voting that i'm aware of you know what do you think the pluses and minuses are here i i think conviction voting works really well as long as there's a lot of proposals when there's not a lot of proposals happening it's too easy sometimes to pass a proposal because you basically mandating the dow to spend money at a certain rate uh yeah effectively and so it's really easy to pass proposals if there's not a lot of competition so i think it works really well for big big things and and like the biggest plus is exactly that that um minority opinions can actually pass proposals like i think like like even if there's a small group of people that are have a lot of conviction behind this idea but the majority doesn't like it uh now in a normal dao situation that just could never happen like they couldn't pass it but in conviction voting they could as long as they had enough of enough conviction they were patient enough to hold their tokens behind that concept and then it would pass and so i i think it's the coolest thing the biggest plus is that minority of opinions can actually pass a pass proposals but you know the next one is really good as well which is retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding and i i know i know you know a lot more about this than i do honestly so i'll sling it your way yeah uh well i wish carl flourish was uh carl flores was like my second podcast guest on the greenfield podcast and he's an inspiration always i wish he was here to explain it because they at optimism they're actually implementing retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding it's basically a way of doing [[public good|public goods]] funding [[public good|public goods]] are just kind of like commons goods you can think of them retroactively so basically what they're doing at optimism and i'm going to do my best to describe it carl and vitalik if you're listening then uh hopefully i got it right but basically what they're doing is they're creating a committee of experts and they're channeling about a million dollars worth of revenue from the optimism network and they're basically asking the committee of experts which things in the past have delivered value to this ecosystem so basically if you your ethers js if if you're building um a client a a protocol level client in the ethereum ecosystem and you have not been rewarded for your work in the [[public good|public goods]] then retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding means that you can have some sort of assurance that if you create good for [[public good|public goods]] then that committee of expert at n years into the future is going to recognize that and is going to reward you in the future why does that matter you can create an incentive in the present uh to work on [[public good|public goods]] to work on the commons if you have a reasonable rationable rationable rational legitimate belief that in the future you will be rewarded for that so you can affect the behavior in the present based off of this idea that there will be millions if not billions of dollars of [[public good|public goods]] in the future and what becomes really cool about this is that you can allocate you can if you're a vc and and you want to fund things that are going to generate a return for your investors right you have a fiduciary duty to invest in things they're going going to produce a return for your investors you can start looking at [[public good|public goods]] now and you can say well i can assume that optimism is going to have n millions of dollars worth of funding for retroactive [[public good|public goods]] in m years in the future and this project is doing a lot of verified [[public good]] and i might get an exit out of investing into this [[public good]] thing in the present and so you can get more capital and talent to rotate towards more regen projects in the present because you've got this future expectation of retroactive [[public good|public goods]] so there's a reflexivity between the present behavior and the amount of [[public good|public goods]] that are created and the future legitimacy of the belief that [[public good|public goods]] are going to be funded retroactively yeah that was a lot okay it is a lot but and and that's that's probably the biggest challenges for retroactive [[public good|public goods]] at least it like i think that retroactive [[public good|public goods]] on the base layer is a perfect mechanism in a way because it cannot fail it will fund some [[public good|public goods]] you know well the other thing is like it's easier to see say what has provided value in the past than speculate on what is going to provide value in the future so the retroactive thing makes things way harder on one dimension but also way easier on another dimension and it makes it easier on the hardest dimension which is distribution you know all of these all of these goals most of the most of these mechanisms it's like how do we distribute funds to the right people and retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding just kind of says don't worry about it let's just see who succeeds right yeah and and that's huge now bootstrapping the market that it might potentially derive that's going to be a lot of work that's the biggest challenge is that is achieving the full-on dream but yeah there's no fail like if you you have a donation pot retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding is such a great strategy yeah i mean i i think that now that we've gone through [[quadratic funding]] conviction voting and retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding i want to say a couple things about the category of these web era mechanisms together the first is that they're each comprised of a funding source and a distribution mechanism so [[quadratic funding]] is donor-based at least on bitcoin it's donor based and uh the distribution mechanism is [[quadratic funding]] conviction voting uh is based off of some dow wanting to distribute their treasury and the mechanism is conviction voting retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding on optimism is funded by optimism sequencer fees and then the mechanism is this actually like uh witness expert based panels that determine where the money goes and so what i think is really cool as we're exploring this design space is how can we mix and match the funding sources with the mechanisms and create more diversity in how [[public good|public goods]] are funding by i don't know maybe we can sprinkle a little bit of [[quadratic funding]] into retroactive [[public good|public goods]] funding or conviction voting on top of [[quadratic funding]] can layer uh together in a pluralistic way and when you have this pluralism at the base layer where all these mechanisms are either interoperable as money legos modularly with each other but can be stacked on top of each other what you're starting to do is creating systemic anti-fragility in how [[public good|public goods]] are funding we're no longer relying on one large monolithic entity to fund our [[public good|public goods]] but and there's no capture uh and there's no and there's less fragility because you can rely on multiple income sources from multiple mechanisms and funding sources so i don't know that's just me zooming out a little bit on if you have anything to add there griff [[public good|public goods]] legos you know that's that's the meme and and i think that it's uh it's the way you know we we all we have to i love the practical pluralism that uh you and aaron are often pushing out there where it's like yeah let's let and and also the kind of hackathon like coopetition vibe that's out there in in the [[public good]] space where it's just like hey there's no competition in creating value for society everybody wins so we it's really a lot easier in this space to work together and really focus on getting our little pieces right and making sure that they're interoperable and composable so i i mean i i just think uh i think we're on the right path and it will be unstoppable yeah yeah so the practical pluralism thing is a greenpill episode that we've done if you google practical pluralism you see the essay and we had um myself you oren from clr fund carl flores from optimism pm mancini from open collective trent from protocol guild and abby from radical kind of all talking about how we're creating a category of [[public good|public goods]] funding things together and our diversity is actually our strength right and it was just very beautiful to have seven of the top uh regen web3 founders all together just espousing practical pluralism up on stage so uh yeah i hope and and you know the the end result hopefully this will be a systemic incentive for all the world's agents humans but hopefully one day's ai is to uh fund the commons to support the commons and i think that you know just the fact that that income stream will be coming from multiple mechanisms and sources will create much stronger of a mechanism than if we put all our eggs on one basket totally totally and all right yeah oh i just love i was going to segue too i i love how uh uh we're both hosts you know i host i host calls just that's all my that's on my whole day but yeah so i i love how you started with like um uh how mechanisms and funding streams can come together and i think uh we would be amiss not to add nfts we actually talked before this call you know and like to try to scramble all these this one didn't really come up but it's like in the last couple years it is a huge funding stream for [[public good|public goods]] uh and and like public nouns and uh rainbow rolls and so many nft projects for charities or for arts uh that are really creating a [[public good]] like especially like nft art is so cool because the art is accessible to anyone yes there there's and then they kind of create a digital scarcity around that piece of art and the the fact that it's a scarce resource all of a sudden allows it to create value so the artist can fund their public a good creation which is hey art that anyone can see online you can go to openc and it's like the you know the the right click save is like stealing an nft right but they're actually proving the point which is that especially nft art or whether it's music or art or uh any kind of art it's uh it's created this accessibility which makes the color good while also creating a very unique funding stream and uh like there's this really cool project called uh public nouns which is using the nouns strategy of auctioning off uh one nft out of regular cadence in public nouns it's every 12 hours to raise funds just to donate to projects you know and right now they just use classical voting but they could easily take the take these streams and donate it to [[quadratic funding]] to to the matching pool on gitcoin or to other various mechanisms so i think nfts are like the the probably the biggest mainstream uh funding stream for digital [[public good|public goods]] that we've seen come out of the web era mechanisms yeah i think that you know this thing about nfts makes me want to talk about a concept called network goods and basically what it is is like private goods are rival risk like if i if i have this iphone you can't have that iphone um and [[public good|public goods]] are things that are non-rival risks like i can breathe clean air and you can uh breathe clean air but there's a category of goods called network goods get that get more valuable the more people consume them and like [[open source]] software is an example of this the more people download this npm package and submit their bug reports back and kick the tires on it the more valuable it becomes for every other person who downloads that [[open source]] project and this is what i think the value accrual mechanism between nft with nfts are is that the more attention is accrued to a piece of art whether it's music or an image or a movie that is nftized the more value is attributed to that it's the same reason like information wants to be free in a networked uh information age environment and the um and and so network by recognizing this property of network goods that are anti-rival risks that grow more valuable the more people consume that we create a whole new category of business models for things and so i can own the nft and the rights to it but i can still let everyone else enjoy it and in fact the fact that everyone else is enjoying it makes it much more valuable to own and so it kind of inverts this traditional scarcity based model of of of selling art and music and i think that that's kind of a really beautiful fundamental inversion of of how we're funding the arts and i would say that art is a [[public good]] uh depending on who it hits and and and who it serves absolutely uh they were given at defcon there's a project that was giving away jackets that say street art is a [[public good]] you know uh and and it really is and and art isn't always a [[public good]] because sometimes you can buy it and keep it in your house like a lot of really famous art but nfts are a [[public good]] you know and that's that's really cool uh and what nfts really do and and we'll go into this more and like and and maybe all network goods in some way uh create they cr it's this market of supply and demand your integrating market dynamics uh of supply and demand into a into a [[public good|public goods]] funding stream which is is amazing and i really like this network goods analogy and i would say that almost every crypto currency is effectively follows under that category all right i think we've hit our five minute cap on nfts so i'm gonna take us into effective altruism which is the least popular publicist funding mechanism in the wake of spf and who is a prominent web3 well not even web three but like uh effective altruist and um you know the spf and the ftx things uh aside i do think that effective altruism is is worth going through so basically effective altruism as i understand it is basically based off of the idea that we don't give to have an impact we actually mostly psychologically give in order to feel better about ourselves so you know i can i i feel better about my impact on the world and and and and what i've done if i've given to a cause and i don't actually really care if it creates actual tangible impact in the world and so effective altruism kind of is as a philosophy and and um you know uh i think that different people implemented in different ways which is maybe why i don't totally discount it in the wake of fd tx's collapse and all the problems we've discovered with ftx is basically what if we categorized causes by which causes and and programs for creating good in the world we're creating the most good on a utilitarian basis so basically uh if you create a if you create a really data analytic based approach to this and i think that there's projects like give well that do this i can figure out that by um by giving five dollars i can these numbers are just made up but i can get get five malaria nets which in certain parts of the world will save a hundred lives over the course of 10 or 15 years and you know um you know as opposed to giving that same money to some other cause that has less utilitarian impact on the world so what if we could rank our causes measure the actual impact of those causes and only give to the projects that have that are the most effective out there so sam harris is a prominent podcaster that i follow that is really into effective altruism and i think that effective altruism is uh really interesting when it's paired with this idea of a giving what you can pledge sam harris i think pledges ten percent of his income to effective altruism and he just has it on auto debit on these sites called givewell that uh will effectively like give to as many of the causes that are vetted to be good as possible one criticism i've seen of effective altruism is that it only gives to things that have impact today and so if you're trying to get an altruist project off the ground in the future and it's not proven to be effective yet you don't really have that seed capital so it only works well at scale and so there's kind of a consolidation effect that happens with effective altruism another criticism that i've heard of effective altruism is this idea of earn to give which is basically what spf was doing where he created a giant ponzi scheme we think it was a ponzi it's an alleged ponzi scheme and basically was going to earn billions of dollars and give it away 99 of it uh well he thought to effective altruist cause is he ended up giving up 99 of it because the market imploded around his thing but he in the in the fallout of that market implosion he didn't actually like he just basically used effective altruism to whitewash his reputation and all the damage he was doing in the in in the world by saying that he was going to earn to give he was going to earn a lot of money and then eventually give it away so uh people are earned to give has kind of had a damaged reputation because of that and now people are thinking well you should just give along the way as you're earning and and coming up in the world so i know that's my my little three-minute rant on effective altruism you got any takes on effective altruism griff i mean the hardest thing is generating impact data this is such a challenge you know impact impact is by nature qualitative and we're trying to turn it into something that we can quantify it's like quantify how beautiful the sunset is quantify how delicious your your favorite dish by your mom is you know it's just these things are you know quantify like you know they're not fungible with each other yeah like how do you value a sunset versus like a saved life versus like the taste of your own meal porridge in the morning it's it's hard to collapse those all into one dimension like a money vector yeah it's just it's it's just a really it's it's really an impossible challenge it's a it's manageable it's a best management i do think there's some interesting ethical dilemmas that come up there where you're basically like well don't we have a moral like if you were walking down the street and you saw someone who just got hit by a car you would absolutely go to them and try to help them but the same thing we know that across the world there are people dying of entirely preventable causes but we go through our days and we don't spend our money on allocating and so i think that trying to quantify those things it brings up some interesting ethical questions uh about why we do what we do and why why our capital goes to the things we do but i think that in general it's very hard to collapse all of value into one vector which is money yeah um actually i may i i may violate our schedule that we had here at griff and talk about hyperserts next if that's okay yeah okay so yeah so um full disclosure this is a project that i'm working on with protocol labs and we're going to have an episode on it soon and basically hyper certs are basically what if you um everyone's are you familiar with the idea of carbon credits griff of course so so yeah i i if i take 10 tons of carbon out of the atmosphere uh then i can get a carbon credit that says that i did that and that might have a market value so what if we could generalize a carbon credit into any impact vector i fixed 10 potholes in my community i uh i picked up 10 pieces of trash in my community i i saved 10 lives i funded 10 months of [[open source]] software what if we could create uh any impact out could issue hyper certs when they actually have a positive impact on the world and then what you can do is you can bootstrap a marketplace of impact evaluators that say okay i actually verify that this thing had an impact act and this this impact owl isn't full of shape and then what if you could get people who want to collect those hyper asserts in order to show how virtuous they are so you know web 2 is all about virtue signaling web3 could be about proof of virtue because you have these hyper certs that you've collected showing that you funded [[open source]] software that you've cleaned up potholes that you have rescued people from poverty and so what we're doing with hyper services bootstrapping in a triple-sided marketplace where impact owls can issue hyper certs impact evaluators can put their stamp and say they're legit and then people can purchase those hyper certs and then the sum value of that is that any impact dow now can go from worrying about how much value they can capture to how much value they can create and that systemically shifts the incentives towards impact dallas actually having a business model which means more capital and talent can rotate into impact else i don't know if you can tell but i'm really excited about hyperserts by the way i think this solves the biggest problem that you said with effective altruism which is how do you measure the causes that are actually having an impact well if you can create a decentralized signal generation [[collective intelligence]] marketplace where people are issuing evaluating and purchasing these hyper certs then you can start to have a decentralized data source about whether this impact is is happening uh any comments on hyperservice orea oh yeah no i mean i'm all i feel like hyper certs have a huge opportunity because it's kind of like effective altruism plus nfts unless you centralization yeah and and uh i i feel like the market opportunities there are huge the biggest challenge i i mean i'm just curious why these haven't worked in traditional systems you know like uh their their their impact markets have been a thing before nfts and and yeah but you don't see them in the traditional world so my biggest uh my biggest question i i don't know if you have an answer to it like where did how have impact markets failed in the and why is this going to be different yeah well there wasn't a perfect coordination substrate for them griff um i i i'm personally  __  posting but i do think with the scale of a global transparent programmable immutable ledger things will be different um but you know what uh one thing that i've learned about carbon carbon credits which is kind of the only example of hyper certs that are at scale right now or i guess like a subset of what hyperserts could do at scale is that 99 of the buy pressure is government mandated so if you're a stock that has to have hit some sort of esg mandate you don't actually reduce your emissions you just purchase hyper certs or sorry i carbon credits to get out of it so the real question is how do you bootstrap by pressure in a decentralized way where there is no mandates do you get vitalik to tweet about it do you integrate them into [[gitcoin grants]] so that every contribution is in hyper purchase or do you uh integrate them with like tinder so that you can show how virtuous you are uh when you're when you're trying to get a date or something like that so bootstrapping the buy pressure i think is is the hardest part of of hyperservice if we could use our social and cultural power to make it cool to collect these things and to show them off then i think that there's maybe something there i think there's a lot there i think hyper certs have have a lot of legs and i i they're a perfect [[public good|public goods]] lego you know uh if at least like because the dream is you know that we can create a market around it if nothing else we can create a donation market a donation game around it so uh and and it kind of leads into the next one which is the augmented bonding curve because the augmented bonding curve is is uh is solves some of those problems about bootstrapping the market uh because uh the the go so bonding curves big words scary word it's really actually pretty simple it's just a [[smart contract]] that mints and burns tokens on demand and holds the money that it collects when it means when it mints the token right so you know uh but the coolest thing about a bonding curve is that it solves the liquidity issues and the the price discovery issues for low liquid markets so uh what i love about bonding curves is you can use them to start up small marketplaces uh like a small market like uh what would be a traditionally e-liquid market where there's not a lot of demand because uh it it's a single-sided market which honestly bonding curves will win a nobel prize in economics i say this all the time and i because i really firmly believe it there's any other with any other system if you wanted to buy amazon stock someone has to sell amazon stock right if you want to uh if you if if you want to buy a chair someone has to sell a chair if you want to if you want to sell a glass of water someone has to buy your glass of water but if you want to sell a token on a bonding curve you just send it to the bonding curve no one has to buy it because the bonding curve destroys the token and releases the collateral it holds and so uh this is great for bootstrapping micro economies and the augmented bonding curve is a funding stream because you say uh not only does is there a bonding curve but you augment it in a few ways but just to cut scope the big way that you augmented is by basically fees on the on the mint and burn aspect of the of the bond curve so when someone sends money into mint a token uh some of the money goes to a a pot of funds and that is governed by token holders and then the rest of the money actually mints tokens and then if someone wants to sell their token they send it to the bonding curve the token is destroyed and of the money that's released most of it goes to the person who sold the token but some of it goes to the collected the collective common pool so it's super cool because uh this this is a continuous funding stream that's market based and then uh and and as long as there's actually buying and selling going on you're going to have this volatility which will actually lead to public this funding so uh i'm very bullish on the on the augmented bonding curve for bootstrapping markets so let me try to say it back to you just so that the listener hears it in two different speaking styles um but uh basically a bonding curve is a way of bonding the supply of an asset to a uh exponential curve and also the price of the asset to an exponential curve so i can have an asset that is worth one dollars uh when it's first minted the first mint of it and then the price goes up x percent when there's demand and it's minted so it would go up let's say it goes up five percent oh no i should choose easy numbers because i'm bad at math it goes from one dollar and then i have one unit of buy pressure and then it goes one mint and then it goes up 10 to a dollar ten and then on the next minute it'll go up another 10 to a dollar uh 21 oh god i'm going to hang myself with this math really cool really quickly yeah um but okay so let's let's conveniently invent that there's one unit of cell pressure and uh then when that that then that when that cell pressure happens it'll go from 121 down to 110 and that unit of supply will be burned and then if another unit of supply is sold onto the bonding curve then it'll go back down to one dollar where it started so basically it's a way of of sort of creating an exponential price curve in which an asset can be issued on a primary market um and and and bonding that price and the supply to that exponential curve and this is actually a mechanism that when austin and griffith and i were coding up moonshot bots uh which was an nft to show that you support [[public good|public goods]] it would actually push up the price from uh i forget exactly the mechanism but i think that the last moonshot bot sold for like something like 35 eth which was like 100k in the most recent bear market so or starting the most recent bull market so i've seen i attest i'll put my hand to this guy i've seen the power of bonding curves um i don't know about the nobel prize thing that's your call but uh if if it does then you'll be able to point back at this and say i told you so single-sided markets man it deserves a nobel prize but uh but yeah single-sided markets yeah it's incredible right every other time you need a buyer or a seller here you just you can just uh sell it this liquidity and and accurate price discovery in the local markets but i actually i'm ready to move on though i'm very curious about dominance assurance contracts i see this on our list i've never heard of it before oh man let's get weird all right so let's start with assurance contracts assurance contracts are just basically a way of saying i want to fund this project but i only want to fund it if other people want to fund it so it's basically a group coordination mechanism where you can say within x weeks if project y reaches uh z threshold then all of the funds in this project will be transferred to the project owner and if it does not reach that threshold within x weeks then all of the money will be be returned to the funder so that's an assurance contract it basically says yo i'm down to fund this if you all are that's all an insurance contract is i'll do it if you guys do it what's that like kickstarter like kickstarter i should have just said that okay cool this is why it's good to have ping pong back and forth between us a dominance insurance contract creates another category of funder that is the dominant uh funder of that and basically i could go to you and i could say hey i'll fund this if you do but a dominance assurance contract what it does is it allows me to go to you and say hey griff i believe in this so much that i'm organizing the funding round and i'm putting in uh like 15 of the capital and the way the mechanism works is that um if the contract reaches its goal then the dominant funder will get their money back uh and then some before the project gets funded and but if if um if the project does not get funded then they lose their money and it's distributed to all of the secondary holders so it's a bay a way of like really putting your money where your mouth is and say i'm all in like i'm all chips on the table for this project getting funded and i'm willing to go around and do the effort of organizing everyone else being uh funding it also so there's two layers to this assurance contract like kickstarter if if within x weeks why project is funded at z threshold then uh then the money the project gets funded and everyone gets their money back if not dominance insurance contract creates a stakeholder that is incentivized to organize the whole thing by their own profit motive and and and like uh is you can think of as like pool two for assurance contracts like i'm all in on that so do you have any questions about that does that make sense wow that is so cool it's such a cool full donation game it's kind of like integrating a little bit of gambling a little bit of speculation like you know it's like yeah hey you know i think this i think this project's gonna pass you know but then like if you don't like and tell me if i'm getting this right uh so if you're like i think this project's gonna pass i'm gonna be the largest funder you know and so you you try to one-up everybody and fund more than the other person but if you don't think the project's gonna pass you actually also kind of want to put money in right because you're like well i don't think this is going to pass but yeah but then you put some money in but like uh you want to put as much as you can because you want to get a return but then you don't want to put in so much that it actually passes right so it's kind of like a it's such a fun donation game uh man if that if that was uh that would just be fun to play it's like i wish casinos had this this is how casinos could fund [[public good|public goods]] did i get that right yeah i think that you're we're blending regen stuff with dj and stuff like at a good casino a little bit to our our region things but this is uh you know a lot of creating fluidity in the web 3 space is creating better incentive mechanisms to do good so the casino mechanism here is um you know maybe to the agent that's funding the thing a way of making a profit but or or maybe it's a way of um on the systemic level making it more likely that that threshold will be caused so it's it's a means to that end of like it's a dj and means to a regen end yeah i mean it it's like going to a charity casino night you know or playing bingo you know or or even the lottery right in in the states at least a lot of the lottery state lotteries yeah they give they fund they fund public education and but this is a lot more fun and it's decentralized and and a man is someone working on this um uh if not they should be i should be yeah um i've we've been thinking about uh at super modular we're building a bunch of new regen web3 protocols and one of the ideas was to build a [[gitcoin grants|gitcoin grant]] 2.0 fork that was based off dominance assurance contracts instead of [[quadratic funding]] um and this is based off of my experience i don't know if people know this but [[gitcoin grants]] uh was originally launched as a subscription site where you could subscribe to your favorite [[open source]] projects for ten dollars a month and no one gave a  __  about that and so when we switched to [[quadratic funding]] the uh the it actually took off so like what if we could just do more mechanisms all together in one crowdfunding site sorry what did you say eip uh 1337. elite eip i was i was give it was about to adopt all that but it just yeah it took off i still think subscription services are really good mechanism for private goods so we're not going to cover them here yeah but uh um okay so my brain is almost putty after 55 minutes of doing this but let's keep going for the listeners who are marathon uh coordination people tell us about the next item on the list yeah so these these ones i think we can go faster because there's not a lot of action in them uh i'm thinking like give power ve curve v e vowel and maybe one day ve uh gtc it's like this vote escrow right so it's how do we distribute um a streaming reward to something uh the ve curve ve bell these are really built to distribute rewards to liquidity providers that are willing to like uh either put their money in curve or in balancer but give power we're using it to actually distribute rewards to donors so uh anyone you can stake and lot give tokens behind a project and then uh the the more give tokens that are locked behind that project the more uh give backs go to the donors of the project so give back to this mechanism we didn't actually add it in here as a mechanism but one people donate to projects on giveth they get they get the web 3 tax deduction which is give tokens and so like like for instance uh the the the the um the funding pool the oh man the matching pool that gitcoin has is actually on giveth so if you wanted to fund get coins matching pool the best place to do is on giveth because if you send money on giveth then you'll actually get give tokens in return subsidizing your donation and with give power that amount of give tokens that are given back to people is actually modulated by the amount of give token staked behind the project and and unfortunate the problem with this is that it's very clear plutocratic so if i say this back to you it seems like if i give to the get coin grants matching pool which by the way there will be a link in the show notes if anyone wants to get their give back um the uh basically if i give n dollars then i'll get m dollars worth of give backs and gives tokens and basically it's a way of rewarding people for um funding things with by creating a sort of distribution of governance of giveth um and so basically it's a it's a it's a way of allocating the ownership slash governance of giveth um and at the same time incentivizing more people to use giveth thus bootstrapping the [[network effect|network effects]] of giveth is that right exactly it's like donation mining you know instead of giving mining rewards to people who are you know solving like proof of work schemes uh here we're giving mining rewards to uh donors i love that um donation mining is a meme that you should create i i think that for for all the yield farmers that were around in d5 summer donation mining i think is a really interesting idea yeah i'll i'll i'll i'll add that to our meme parties yeah i um let's let's keep going what's what's budget what's budget box budget box is a really cool concept that came some came from some gig of brains from uh the colony ecosystem and uh it was actually they wrote a really beautiful paper in 2018 and it's basically a pairwise assessment so think of like tinder or hot or not except instead of having to swipe right or left it's really compared do you like this get coin project or or this get congruent or that get coin grant you know and you just have to pick one or the other and so uh i i really like budget box because it's a it's effectively a a really easy ux voting methodology so you can you can just say you can start ranking the projects but it's really fun it's it's a really good way to give qualitative assessments which is naturally really hard and distribute it in a fun way like i like this one i like that one and it's really easy and low cognitive overhead especially versus reading forum posts about like uh which project is the best you know yeah so it's a way of uh instead of swiping right on a possible date i'm swiping right on a bitcoin grant or a giveth grant that i want to do and i want to like just take the listener into a oh man uh this is gonna be deeply technical it's gonna sound deeply technical but it's not hard let's go there there's this technology called collaborative filtering which basically allows a website to say okay user x likes a b and c and d and user y likes a a and b maybe they like c and d also at scale at web scale so it pairs you as a user with other users who are who have similar preferences to you and uses the [[collective intelligence]] of uh oh this user likes c and d maybe this other user who is like them also will like c d and so once you have budget but once you have a sufficient amount of data on the profile of the users you actually don't have to um make have them make all these complicated decisions with the with the data set at scale you can actually use collaborative filtering in order to figure out what uh what they may like with a higher frequency and by the way this is like what powers on facebook your suggested friends and and your uh amazon related items on your shopping cart like this is a very web 2 era technology and it's what would i think make budget box really powerful yeah i mean and i think just as an overall uh process this is what we need to get into voting we need to get these web 2 like machine learning algorithms into getting us to signal our preference with very low effort right like no one i don't have to vote for what ads are shown to me on amazon it it has it aggregates the data and then like picks one yeah if if only voting was that easy you know if only i could just have my own personal server with an ai bot where i control the data and i've put in all of my texts all my communications through this thing and then all of my voting that i have to do because like i'm a steward for gtc i'm a sewer at ens i'm a super optimism and then i give a token engineering comments oh my god how do you do it all you know i'm exhausted just hearing that list beautiful but but you know i i'm very excited about [[public good|public goods]] and number three so we gotta do it but wouldn't it be great if i could just train an ai bot send in all of my communications and it would just like kind of make a guess on what i would vote for and i just have to like watch it once in a while oh you know when will voting ux be that easy one of the things i like to do like uh when we're back when we were doing user tests of [[gitcoin grants]] for like people would load up a bunch of carts and then they would check out in one transaction is like after the confirmation page came up i was like gotcha you don't know it but you just voted like you thought you were funding something in an e-commerce style ui but actually you were participating in democracy like gotcha uh because it like the best i i think that you're like your thesis is absolutely right is that um future democracy will not feel like driving to the ballot box and taking a bunch of boxes um and it'll feel a little bit more like it could be bundled up in an e-commerce workflow or a workflow that feels a little bit more elegant um and and i think that there's like going to be a whole category of mechanisms that don't feel like work but are you're actually doing work in in creating [[collective intelligence]] for the for the collective exactly okay let's let's push through these things there's only a few left and we're way over oh my gosh who's gonna listen to this over and out yeah hopefully a bunch of uh people who are building a more regenerative web but i don't know all right what's what's futuriki let's get into it man i don't know futurarchy that well honestly but it's basically voting on on uh kind of like impact mark effect of altruism where you're making a bet that this that the future will end up a certain way and that this proposal will actually have a huge impact and you get rewarded if they do so it's kind of like including the the impact of the of the proposal uh on the economy or on whatever you're voting in with with your choice to vote yes or no on it so if you supported it you would get rewarded if it had a huge impact uh but you wouldn't if it didn't so it's kind of like bringing voters into the the uh prediction market um well we could do a whole another episode on my prediction markets are powerful but it seems like basically um uh you basically kind of like bet on an outcome that you want to see and that creates a reflexive uh incentive to make sure that that outcome actually actually happens so it like creates the coordination incentive uh am i getting that right at all i think so but honestly it's been i haven't looked at futurarchy since 2018 2019 when people were developing on it but prediction markets in web 3 never really took off so so according to wikipedia which is our primary source of this podcast just for future arc the rest of them we know future arc is a form of government government proposed by economist robin hansen i like robin hansen in which elected officials define measures of national well-being and prediction markets are used to determine which policies will have the most positive effects so basically if you bet on the right horse if you bet on the right policy and that is the one that turns out like you're basically using markets to sort through which policies are going to create the metric of national well-being feels like this is powerful because it leverages the power of markets but um also if like what's the whole thing about like it once a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure that feels like a little bit applicable here yeah totally these metrics are so tough you know increasing gdp go it works really well if you have a war you know and destroy all the buildings yeah there's a lot of then there's a lot of things to build right well it's also like how do you measure national happiness you know like you said it's hard to quantify happiness so you know if you're going to do it on things that we actually want to measure then those things often aren't quantifiable yeah yeah what's what's stigmergy yeah uh is basically the it's a mechanism of indirect coordination through which through the environment between agents or actions so basically the principle is that a trace left in the environment by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agents this is by the way how ants coordinate um they don't have wi-fi between each other it'd be cool if they did but like they basically have to leave these pheromones in which tell the other ants go over here there's food here or the nest is back this way so they're leaving these stigmergic trails the more ants that go down these trails and the ones that really put down the more pheromones will lead more ants to go down in a certain direction so maybe this isn't like a collective [[public good|public goods]] funding allocation ism but i think it's an attribute of other mechanisms is that like this is actually by the way maybe [[quadratic funding]] is the way to connect this is like if you fund this grant um then that's a stigmergic that's the equivalent of like an ant pheromone that says go here like if i trust griff and he says lays down a pheromone on this bitcoin grant then then i'm gonna fund it um so maybe this is more of a property of the other mechanisms than a mechanism in itself the cart functionality that you had when you could share a cart very stickmergic yeah yeah um so what i think is interesting is like the reflexivity of some of these things where one agent doing an action causes other agents to follow down that action and if you can create a web of trust that says hey these are the people that um have high credibility and they get more credibility the more good stuff they do and they lose credibility the worst stuff they do like there's kind of a reflexive stickmergic attribute to a lot of these mechanisms which is cool yeah all right we've gone to overtime on sigma g tell me about praise yeah praise is so cool i i love crazy because it it it's a kind of a reward system slash reputation system where uh it's very bottom up and peer-to-peer collaborative uh so you might have like a collective pot where you say hey we're gonna give away you know two thousand dollars to the people who are praised every two weeks and uh praise is super simple it's just a discord bot where you say i praise kevin owaki for this thing for the incredible podcast that he runs greenpill is an inspiration to the regen movement right and uh and then those praises just kind of build up and you could just just use it as a way to inspire a culture of gratitude you don't have to do anything further from that because i feel like in the digital space that's missing a lot but where it becomes a collective allocation mechanism is in the quantification aspect so this is this is addressing this problem how do we how do we quantify qualitative value creation and uh the best way is human signaling you know humans being the the the transformer so uh at the end of a two-week period uh the quantifiers will step up and they'll be rewarded for quantifying and they'll say hey uh they'll they'll give a score to each praise and then each qualitative uh input of praise of gratitude right actually ends up with a token allocation based off of these scores and so you can kind of have this like repeatable thing but there's so many cool second order effects the gratitude component and just the higher vibes and then of course like you end up with the quantifiers getting kind of an overview of a lot of things that are happening in the community and the coolest thing though is you get all this data you get all this very rich data that you could effectively use machine learning techniques to uh to take that data and use it so to inspire the community or inform the community about who's doing what and and this sort of thing so it's going to be super cool hmm i i feel like it i feel compelled to mention coordinate here because i know that they're doing giving circles at scale in token allocations based off of them and so i just feel compelled to mention them because they're a prominent uh part of i mean how would you compare and contrast the way coordinate works with with praise coordinate is really cool because it's uh it's the same kind of human signaling qualitative qualitative input uh where people are distributing things uh but and it but it's and it's lower effort in many ways because it just happens once a month right and people are distributing the data um and so but uh but it's harder in some ways because there isn't this uh this reason why right like with with praise you get this reason why someone got some amount of tokens every time and with courtney if it's it's uh there's it's it's way easier and and way lower effort but then you don't have the reason why you know uh so so it's but it but they're also great and i want to give a shout out to other outer space too they're they're another up and coming reputation system like reward system that's coming through with nfts and leveling up nft badges and they're doing cool stuff so i think there's a lot of action in the rewards and reputation system of game and thank you because we need it yeah i mean so there's this idea of the web of trust which is basically like it was kind of invented this is what page rank at google was where basically larry and sergey realized that any websites linked to another website was an implicit vote of trust in that website and when you aggregate a graph and distribute reputation according to those links you can rank the web based off of the distributed [[collective intelligence]] of what the web thinks is valuable and you create this iterative sort of evolutionary game where you uh deliver trust in the system and i think it's really interesting like i see this with praise and with auto space and with coordinate in which people vote on each other and uh who they think is valuable is adding value and that creates a similar web of trust type model and now we can drop tokens on top of the web of trust which makes it even cooler um and and so um i want to connect that to another video but i'm curious if you have thoughts on web of trust before i do i love i love the web address model i feel like it there's like trust lines and bright id and there and circles are all using that too and and i feel like they're a whole nother uh form of uh of in some ways what we're talking about or collected using [[collective intelligence]] to reallocate resources that we totally missed you can you can create simple resistance with that too and listeners know that i'm obsessed with [[sybil resistance]] um the idea that i wanted to connect here was this um i really feel like what we're doing in regen web3 is connecting financial capital to other types of capital in this scenario we're uh not only connecting financial capital to social and cultural capital but we're making the financial capital subservient to our social and cultural capital as opposed to the social and cultural capital uh being subservient to the financial capital and so there's this there's this idea from gregory landua the founder of region network that there's eight types of capital social capital material financial living intellectual this podcast is a form of intellectual capital spiritual capital and cultural capital what would it mean to build a financial system that doesn't extract these other type of capitals in order to create financial upside but instead is in service of the hard to quantify spiritual and living in material capital that uh that we were like this is really about inverting the relationship of finance to to these other types of capital in my opinion absolutely and i think this is where um so many of these things that we're talking about are all about this how do we take something qualitative and quantify it because if we if we can get really good at that then all those other financial caps all those other forms of capital can actually be integrated into systems that we actually that we really want yeah because financial capital is great because it's so quantifiable it's just like look i made some money you know it's in a spreadsheet like coordination is easy but if we can coordinate around qualitative value now we have so much of a richer society yeah um man as the more places i want to go with this but we are over time and we have like three more mechanisms to get through can you go for 10 more minutes and can we get through these in 10 more minutes definitely and this these two will be short so demorage uh demaraj is is the next one and it's kind of like inflation it's except the opposite so you think of inflation where uh you you could even say like bitcoin uses inflation to fund its [[public good]] which is a you know a secure blockchain for value transfer anywhere anyone in the world can create an address uh anywhere else in the world uh and and receive money which itself international access to an international financial system is a [[public good]] uh so then uh they use inflation to do it but demaraj is saying uh actually this money is becoming less valuable uh over time and so uh if you if you thought if bitcoin were to be funded by inflation what it actually do is say oh hey bitcoin holder uh your a fraction of your your big coin that you have one bitcoin well in six months it's going to be 0.99 bitcoin and that other 0.1 bitcoin went to a common pool of funds and so it kind of it's supposed to inspire the the velocity of money and it's really it i mean it was used way back in the day to really model after um scarce resources that degraded like rice or flour and so like the the church would create a a church would create a a stamp that would would say well guess what this rice is rotting so this is this is valuable this is worth one bag of rice but you know the bag gets smaller as time goes on because the rice that's sitting there backing it is degrading and and so that's what den raj is modeled after and but honestly what i've seen is that these systems this demurrage has bad ux i don't think it's a working a good working system i've never seen someone use demorage successfully uh there are lots of people who have tried but i think that there is in this human nature that we don't want things taken from us you know so like having one bitcoin turned to 0.99 is like yeah what the hell well let me ask you this how is this different from taxes i guess it's kind of like a wealth tax it's not based off of your income it's based off of your holdings yes exactly so it's it's so it's very similar to um well yeah it's not on income it's it's based off folded so it's like hey you're you're you have 10 million dollars well you know now you have less what but the but the funny thing is inflation is the exact same uh mechanism yeah but just your unit of account is debased yeah exactly it has inflation has the exact same uh patter the exact same result but the you user experience doesn't feel bad yeah yeah it feels like i got more rich because i'm getting higher yeah all right i'm gonna channel my inner eric voorhees or my interlibertarian and say taxation is theft in demorages probably theft and so absolutely we should move on um tell me about proposer inverter uh yeah the proposal is very super cool it's basically like imagine a [[gitcoin grants|gitcoin grant]] with with a a you know a cap like it has a funding goal and and then uh if it if anyone can fund it which is nice because most proposals you have to create a proposal to one dao right uh and you hope it gets funded and it's kind of a binary yes or no but with this uh you can make one proposal and lots of dows or individuals can fund it and then uh then it's released to the to so to uh the party who made the proposal so you can imagine a market for proposals uh and and then it also has a lot of cool features like milestones so maybe uh all the funders agreed to these milestones and they fund it and and once once it reaches ten thousand dollars then the first two thousand dollars will go to the project they have to complete some milestone there's an assigned reviewer and if they achieve that milestone then they get the next five thousand dollars right and then if they achieve the whole thing they get the last three thousand and uh so but what's the coolest thing is the inversion right the fact that lots of people can fund this and it's it's not a proposal for one doubt but you know if you're solving a problem that helps a lot of different doubts they could all fund it together um this kind of reminds me of have you heard of prop house at all is this the nouns thing but announcing yeah yeah yeah yeah it's really cool is that the same as proposal inverter no because the the let me just say what prop house is and we can compare and contrast them is that sound good yeah cool so prop house is the nounsdale funding mechanism and nouns has a treasury of several tens of millions of dollars if not hundreds of millions of dollars twenty nine thousand each okay god um and so they use prop house how it works is communities hold funding rounds in their community houses in these funding grounds builders can propose ideas to get funding the flow is as follows a funding round is put up by a community each funding round has a fixed amount of capital to be won and it's composed by a proposing in a voting period uh during the proposing period builders can propose ideas they'd like to get funding the proposing period ends after the voting period starts community token holders vote on their favorite proposals and then the top proposals get funded so that it feels like some sort of inversion to me but i don't how do those differ from from your perspective the big difference is it's still within one dial right even though there's committees and stuff and there's still only one funder that's that's the biggest that's the biggest thing but i i think it stands on its own as a very successful mechanism ens uses it to they call it ans small grants uh and and it and i think the cool thing about prop house is the user experience of proposing a grant is just so much easier you know uh these these debates yeah yeah uh but let's let's finish this thing off but with a bank it's so close i could see the light at the end of the tunnel yeah but my brain is so silly putty right now okay [[quadratic voting]] is actually so actually [[quadratic funding]] is a fork of [[quadratic voting]] that uses money instead of uh voting credits but we're gonna do it backwards because i'm the get coin guy um or at least i was the good one guy um so [[quadratic voting]] is basically a way of not only measuring it's a it's an alt on uh one human one vote voting in which you can measure not only the um preferences of a population but you can measure the uh strength of those preferences so basically i get a certain amount of vote credits let's call it 100 vote credits and i get to vote on 10 different things and the way it works is that the voting the votes that i can get are a square root of the vote credit that i spend on each issue so i can spend a hundred voting credits on um a bunch of diff actually let's say there's 100 voting credits on 100 different issues i can spend one vote credit on each individual issue or i can spend 100 voting credits to get 10 votes on one specific issue because 10 is the square root of 100. and so basically what this allows you to do is because there is a higher dimensional input into the system how many voting credits am i willing to spend for how many amount of votes you can measure not only the amount of uh like what someone's preferences are but this the the strength of those preferences if i vote for a with all 100 voting credits only to get 10 votes then you know that i really care about that whereas with with the if i if i spread it out then i've got a bunch of small preferences and this isn't meant to be sort of like the reason why you don't do this with one-to-one voting credits to votes is that you don't want to have a plutocratic thing where like just the loudest voices can can sway any individual issue you want to be able to make it so that the broad consensus of the population is the ones that uh that can swain issue so uh get coin uh back when i was there along with anish from paradigm built this tool called quadratic vote dot co which is an easy way of holding a quadratic vote and um been cool to see that get some usage anything to say about [[quadratic voting]] yeah there's another implementation by wesley from the ethereum foundation called token log uh and and the tec used it for for um kind of deciding what which pro some uh different economic parameters actually and it it's super cool i i really love it because it mitigates it allows you to signal preference and and uh makes it fun you know there's kind of a game it's like okay this is my favorite but my voice will actually be heard if i spread my opinion out across a few different ideas a few different proposals and then i'll have a louder voice the more diverse my opinion is and but then of course you probably have a favorite so it's kind of it's a it makes voting fun and i think uh like all of these mechanisms i they i think the ones that make things is fun are the ones that will win uh yeah and or be used the most i mean there's no winning or losing here but uh yeah so i i i i think that [[quadratic voting]] has a lot of legs and i actually saw glenn wall come out with a a a paper maybe a year ago about how to integrate negative voting in uh where like you can also uh because with [[quadratic voting]] it's it's all upvoting traditionally like there's no there's no no votes which is also nice actually i really like that but uh i think he integrated a way where you could also say no uh for bad proposals and uh but it would cost even more than saying yes uh like my scale at a larger rate i forget exactly the mechanism but because it's in an academic paper you know but it's still really interesting i mean i feel like all of these things were still like really innovating and trying to figure them out and the mechanism design opportunities are huge so i hate to do this to you but i'm going to rug you and add one more mechanism to the event or to the list and that's based off of the insight that you have that the best mechanisms here are going to feel fun so i'm adding joke race to the list which is basically a bottoms up on-chain governance for communities to set entries and vote on their favorites and it's actually i think that joke dao uh made a mechanism where people pitch jokes to the joke dial and they get funding if they tell them and but you could use it for anything you could use it for curating a community road map community endorsements bounties uh generating ideas creations and giveaways but they've implemented it in the funniest stickiest way possible at joke dao by just making it a distributed decentralized joke contest every week so um uh you gotta go to joked out.ao to find out and i don't know i'm just browsing the website and reading what i see it's got a token called joke the joke token and there's a joke race every uh looks like every every week i'm getting that right this is not a financial advice but we're pumping this token no i'm just kidding this is so this is so funny man uh what i i love it i can't i i'm excited to read up on how it actually works because you know i wouldn't be surprised honestly if it just uses one of the mechanisms that we already mentioned mm-hmm yeah it's possible it almost feels like a decentralized slido to me ooh slido what do you mean yeah uh saito is a way where basically if you're holding a meeting with someone you can distribute a slido and they can all put ideas into the slido and then people can upvote each other's ideas so whenever i have a call with like 20 people but we only have like 60 minutes to get through it i'm like hey go vote on this slido of what you guys want to talk about and we'll use the community consensus to vote up what is actually worth uh talking about yeah so it is kind of like [[quadratic voting]] upvotes basically mm-hmm yeah all right uh well my brain is silly putty what do we want to end on griff i i the opportunities in the space man it's insane i mean uh i feel like uh i i give the same i've given this this talk a few times or mentioned in many talks but the opportunity in the [[public good]] space is so huge uh if i want to end it anywhere you know we're just waxing philosophically about how to make the world a better place but if we can actually make the world a better place in a way uh that we do it better than governments can then all of imagine all of the funding that would be unlocked that right now is just being burned by governments to provide value to society with nothing in return if if the 25 trillion dollars a year is my estimate adding up the different expenditures of governments around the world 25 trillion dollars a year is just burned on funding [[public good|public goods]] and if we can actually capture some of the value that's being created i think the market's even way larger than that because that market relies on sacrifice if we can create mechanisms that work that reward that actually reward the people who are contributing it's going to be huge we'll be able to take things that used to be private goods and club goods and actually turn them into abundant resources for society things that were excludable uh we'll instead of privatizing which is what happening happens now because our [[public good|public goods]] economies are so weak uh we'll actually go the other way where we'll publicize for lack of a better word and we'll take like basic needs food water shelter we can take those things out of the private goods space and move it into the [[public good]] space it's i i just want to double click on that number there so when you say 20 trillion dollars uh you're talking about all of the spending on ngos federal governments state governments local governments across the world and our governments are the mechanisms that are distributing or organizing [[public good|public goods]] and so that's where that number comes from is that right exactly i mean the u.s government spends the u.s government and nonprofits together spend 10.5 trillion dollars so the adding uh you know 25 trillion is a very conservative estimate i'm sure it's more than that so you're saying the federal government are including state and local too or state and local state the federal state and local count discounting the stats kind of crazy because if you add them all up individually it's actually more but it's because federal governments fund state governments which fund local governments sometimes funding all the way down yeah they've got a pluralistic funding mechanism at the local state and federal level but in web 3 there's going to be a higher dimensional space of pluralistic funding mechanisms because the idea space in web 3 is so much profoundly larger um but you know i i i'll be curious to see if this thesis about uh web3 [[public good|public goods]] consuming that those markets make sense but it does seem that like we can invent higher resolution mechanisms for democracy here and i mean what's the crypto market cap is less than a trillion and if if your thesis is only like 10 correct then a rational if your thesis is like only 10 correct then irrational builder should be building regen web3 and not just more like decentralized finance decentralized casinos because there's more of a blue ocean in region web 3. hugh it's a huge market that doesn't exist yet it's it's gonna be epic if if we can bootstrap it like that's a good place to end uh where can people find you online griff uh follow me on twitter the griff like t-h-e-g-r-i-f-f-t the griff i didn't even understand that that's grift i'm so sad like i feel like an idiot and i'm stuck with this twitter handle the grift there you go uh and then give it.io common stock common stock.org i think and uh generalmagic.io i have a whole bunch of orgs that uh that are really pushing putting going all in into the [[public good]] space so uh you'll be able to follow follow me and you'll find all me retweeting them incessantly yeah all right well uh it seems like we've mapped out a it seemed over 20 mechanisms of ways that we could create higher resolution digital democracy and [[collective intelligence]] for collective resource allocation this has been a marathon episode so thanks for joining me griff and uh can't wait to do this in another couple years when there's even more mechanisms and we know which ones are going to be successful we'll take days man we should take a mechanism to figure out which mechanism is going to be coin shift is a leading treasury management an infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses that need to manage their treasury

what's up kevin what's the sound of a record scratch like screen remix we uh so after we recorded the first part of this episode griff and i were dming and we're like shoot there's other mechanisms that we didn't cover and so now that we've gotten a good night's sleep or two we want to go through a few more mechanisms and just like make this episode the most complete mechanism design about [[collective intelligence]] which hopefully makes it the most complete resource about better collective resource allocation so that's why we're back back first in bonus content yeah exactly and it's always good to just hang out and chat nice little sunday afternoon chat it's a nice way to get some mechanism designed nerdery in uh before we hang out with our family for thanksgiving so yeah good to nerd it up all right you want to tee us off with holographic consensus yeah this is an og uh dao technique that dow stack really put forth and i think it's definitely worth bringing in because it's it's really cool and i'm surprised there aren't more doubts using it it's uh it's kind of a mix of futurarchy and uh just regular dow voting but basically anyone can put up a proposal and they they make it really easy to initiate a proposal and then the people who have dow tokens can actually vote or planet bet on whether or not that proposal will be approved by the dow and then um when they the when they do that they're basically boosting the the proposal up so it gets more attention from the dow like people and then and it speeds up the process i think to uh to vote on it and then if it passes and people bet for it then it becomes like uh then then those people actually win money and if people bet against it they would lose their stake right so that's kind of uh and i i think it's actually a pretty nice way because a 10 the attention economy is real and there's if if you have a lot of proposals how do you get them to actually be in front of people you know and it's like well i think if you're willing to put money and bet that these people will approve it that's a good signal um so as i understand it's a way of getting from like vote low voter turnout to taking a holograph of the like a low voter turnout and trying to get a more representative turnout uh is that right at all yeah and it's it's kind of saving the voters attention you know it's like trying to be especially if there's a lot of votes you know i think most of these con these mechanisms work best if a lot of them are designed with this idea in mind that a lot of people will make a lot of votes um like holographic consensus is a complete waste of time if there's like one dow vote a month but if there's uh because in fact even um the threshold to be like voted on depends on how many other projects are being boosted past the threshold so there's this little algorithm where it's like there's a constant two to the power of number of projects that are boosted right and uh the threshold to be like kind of up for vote is you can almost think of it like um um what do you call it where you have to get so many signatures before a proposal can actually go up for vote um it's kind of similar to that but for dallas and it is betting so when we first recorded this we said for each mechanism we talk about what is it and what does it work well on and what does it not work well on so uh is it worth quickly revisiting that with respect to holographic consensus yeah i mean i think it works well when there's a lot of proposals and people have like attention like like too much too many things to pay attention to and i i think i think it would work well in that scenario as as an attempt um i don't think it would work well if there's hardly any proposals out there or also if just you know it's a small group of people i think it's really designed for like large groups of people where you have a few people that are really into it you know and they're going to be making bets and whether or not people like this or not and and kind of like a curator aspect and then there's this large group that you know they only want to come in and vote once in a while and they're not going to dive deep into everything that's awesome got it feels like it competes a little bit with like the delegation model that get coin dial works on where the token holders just delegate to the more active people and that's their way of solving the low voter turnout problem with dallas this is like an alternative way of of solving that yeah it's yeah exactly and now but i'm excited about this next one and got on the list man skeuomorphism i yes beyond me i don't know this one let's do it so skeuomorphism is basically the idea uh it's it's actually not a mechanism itself it's a categorization of mechanisms and what skeuomorphism means is that something is skeuomorphic if it could exist in the old world if you're taking something in the old world and just putting it online or putting on a blockchain then that's skeuomorphic and the example of skeuomorphism i like to use is is is one from web web one and web 2 because you know in hindsight it's easier to understand things and basically skeuomorphism is this idea uh like through by wave example yahoo and google both had the goal of organizing the world's information on the internet and they just approached it in two different ways yahoo took the library card catalog system this taxonomy of information and put it online and like if i wanted to find uh i don't know the colorado rockies i wouldn't have to go to the directory and put clicked sports professional uh baseball colorado and i would have gotten the rockies whereas with google i just went to the search box and i just went in and i typed in colorado rockies and i would find them in one and so google invented a non-scheuomorphic mechanism for traversing the world's information whereas yahoo had a skeuomorphic mechanism because they just took the library card catalog system and put it online so the idea here is that any new medium uh fundamental innovation is going to enable a set of mechanisms that are non-scheomorphic over the horizon where if you fundamentally understand from first principles the medium that we are using then you're able to invent a whole new category of things that never existed and so you know taking this into the blockchain world we've now got uh programmable transparent global incorruptible ledgers and what are we going to build on them well first like the the earliest ideas will be just to like port over i don't know the joint stock corporation onto the blockchain but the actually more interesting mechanisms are going to be non-scheomorphic and derived from the first principles of the internet age so not a mechanism itself but a category of mechanisms and i think the most my my sort of hot take here might be that the most interesting mechanisms that we design are going to be non-scheomorphic because uh the design space is so much greater there but it's also harder to think about i mean i think in general collective resource allocation needs a refresher you know it hasn't it doesn't feel like it's really moved too too far forward in the last you know 100 200 years as far as i can tell yeah well i mean you know we we started the episode with that quote from winston churchill about democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other ones that have been tried right so now we have a bunch of non-scheomorphic mechanisms that we can try and maybe we can iterate on what was industrial age democracy from there so that's exciting to me definitely definitely would you call like the get-going governance with delegation would and and of course all the compound governance with delegation is that skeuomorphic or is it refreshed enough since it's token holders and like where does the line where do you draw the line yeah that's a good question i i feel like there's probably a gradient between like zero and one skeuomorphic and non-scheomorphic and um i would say that things like [[quadratic funding]] are probably pretty far in the non-scheomorphic direction whereas things that that that look like delegated governance we've seen in representative democracies before and probably a little bit more skeuomorphic and you know uh yeah it's it's a spectrum though it's not it's not just binary yeah and you know sometimes we i think in this space we tend to innovate too much anyway you know like taking some oldies but goodies and bringing them into the space that everyone is familiar with is really nice and relaxing you know but you don't have to learn everything all the time yeah totally and you know there's uh there's this thing called gal's law um which is basically the idea that any sufficiently complex system that works started from a simpler system that works and it just complexified over time and so you know i don't want to totally drag on skeuomorphic mechanisms like bringing them on chain and just playing with them uh on chain and then make having them be forkable and uh people can play with them in using these tools from the convenience of their computer there's still a lot to be learned from those things but i do think there's going to be a whole category of non-skomorphic mechanisms that are going to be really the most interesting probably that's my prediction for the next 10 like 10 years from now i think that'll be true yeah totally well and and this kind of leans into the next one which is sortation because sortition it would definitely be skeuomorphic uh so titian is do you mind if i just jump into this one let's do it please take us away yeah sortation is something that um we don't use that often in the real world mostly just for jury duty right you know when you kind of like a few people get randomly selected to become a juror in a in a court in the u.s uh that that process is sortition it's and and in general it means taking a few people of the subset of possible voters or possible decision makers and having them make the decision on their own so uh and they have done this for voting before like in especially around you know almost all polling you could say is almost like sortition but it doesn't have the impact of the vote and where you take a small subset of the possible voters and just have them decide and i haven't seen it in crypto actually i well that's not true i've seen it for jurors selection like celeste which is a uh kind of like claris the subjective oracle they they actually will um you know people will stake uh one on one hive's honey token to become a juror and uh sortation will be made and a few of those will be selected to actually decide whether or not this jury you know uh this conflict should be resolved in one direction or the other but uh i haven't seen it i think it'd actually be kind of interesting just to use this process for um you know actual dow votes where you have you know these subset of holders and the number of tokens you have more likely you get called or something and maybe it's even with delegates and it and you just select you know 10 people and then or 11 maybe to make it an odd number and have them vote on whether or not this should happen or not and then those 11 people actually you know put in the time time they think about it because they know that their their decision will ripple throughout the dao and they'll have to be responsible for that but i think it'd be kind of a fun way to mix it up instead of always having the same delegates do it as a profession here you get rid of it's it's very much like delegated democracy except you get rid of the delegates and randomly choose people as as a as it comes up yeah what i like about that so selection of political officials as a random sample of larger pool of candidates is that you don't get career politicians representing you get everyday people representing and it's interesting to learn that i'm just got the wikipedia page up here uh in ancient athenian democracy startition was the traditional and primary mechanism for appointing political officials so i i just think that it's it's it's interesting that it's been the tires have been kicked on this so much in the past and yeah kind of interesting that we haven't seen it in the blockchain space at all which is supposed to be all about governance yeah yeah i think it would be really cool and and like you said it just allows the everyday man to come in there and and say their piece uh and and you can get rid of the politics but you know in some ways power kind of aggregates into these small circles and they want to keep their powers so these kinds of voting mechanisms might not be favored yeah well um i think we're supposed to ask for each mechanism what is it what does it work really well and where does it not work well i think we kind of covered that but let me know if there's anything more to say before we move on to the next mechanism i i think startition could work well maybe the jury's out on crypto you know like we have to see it in use before i'd say it works well or not right totally alrighty well the next one on our list is aqueduct uh which is a mechanism that we've been talking about at gitcoin uh speech speaking of uh things that have been tried in the past you know uh in irrigation systems aqueducts are a way of carrying water from one system to another and so um basically you know if you're building a pluralistic uh civilizational scale system for funding [[public good|public goods]] and say there's like giveth and clr phone and get coin and optimism and all these other mechanisms what does it look like to build bridges between those mechanisms as a mechanism itself so um you know i i there's something on the bitcoin governance forum about aqueducts and basically the idea here is that if you sign up for a get coin aqueduct what you can do is as part of your initial token allocation or as part of your ongoing efforts to build your your ecosystem you can set an aqueduct from your main treasury into [[gitcoin grants]] into a pool of funds that will be allocated to do [[quadratic funding]] for your own community and then you can have a further aqueduct from that to the main matching pool to of ethereum [[public good|public goods]] because you're built on top of ethereum [[public good|public goods]] and maybe you could even like if bitcoin gets there one day if there was a uh all [[open source]] or like all global uh [[public good|public goods]] like climate and uh roads and bridges and all other global [[public good|public goods]] there could be a further aqueduct from there so aqueducts are like in in ancient times a way of carrying water irrigation from one place to another what if we could set up aqueducts that between the modules of [[public good|public goods]] funding and the example that i gave was was the get coin matching pools but you could imagine any sort of aqueduct that um that that goes between any of these mechanisms as we're building this pluralistic web scale civilizational scale uh infrastructure for funding [[public good|public goods]] and i think radical drips is doing a really interesting point here where like it's it's literally called radical drips and you can program like faucets where a certain percentage will go here and a certain percentage will go there according to your governance so i think it's a really interesting primitive to to think about because everything that we're building in this space is so plural and modular yeah it it's it's totally like a stream is the way you're saying it right like that your your governance your issuance of your token in some way or your of some kind of allocation of funds then one way or another is streamed on a regular basis yeah like do you have a do you have a mechanism for that like do you have like a specific algorithm of how it gets distributed or like how does the actual allocation get decided i guess yeah well um so i can only speak so this is a generalizable thing that anyone can use to partner with anyone else in this whole dow of dallas that is being built but specific to get coin there's an aqueduct that's going to be launching when [[gitcoin grants]] 2 launches and i only know this because it was pre-negotiated before i left getcoin's leadership but basically the idea is there's a dial launching uh and i won't say who because it's not the right time to announce that but they're going to have a lot of their initial allocation set to get coin aqueducts at the initial conditions and governance can change it if they want but basically the tokens will flow over a vesting schedule into the get coin grants matching pool [[gitcoin grants]] will run a [[quadratic funding]] round for that community and um there's and and a certain percentage of that community's uh tokens will go down into the main ethereum matching pool so they get to be sponsors of both matching pools and it's just totally up to their governance whether they want to like say gitcoin does a really great job they could turn up the aqueduct or say get coin  __  it up they could turn off the aqueduct and you know use any other platform to do it so basically aqueducts are a way of going from um you know what it actually reminds me of is like when i when i i worked at a retirement company it was like the most tradify job that i ever worked at before i got into crypto and they were always trying to get people to put their uh a percentage of their paychecks into um into their retirement funds because you said it and forget it you don't have to remember to invest in retirement it just happens as you're getting paid an aqueducts is kind of the same thing for community building or [[public good|public goods]] funding interesting interesting and is that would that be the first aqueduct that that get coin put out with this with this new dow there are things that are aqua ducky which is a word i just made up that have happened so far but this will be the first formal like handshake where marketing and as an aqueduct thing that like bitcoin's doing yeah i mean obviously like you said radical drips i mean i have a radical drip going right now and it streams you know from the pot that i gave it to uh to a few projects and it's super cool because then they can continue to stream on uh and and so maybe this idea of just like setting streams set it and forget it i actually and in general magic which is a organization that i run there is one person who's paid by a stream right where they we don't pay them every month they actually just have a stream set to them and if they got fired or uh you know we would end this stream and if they got a raise we would up the stream yeah that's that's kind of it was a it's a beta test but it's it feels like the same kind of idea and i i think that's pretty cool yeah i mean maybe i shouldn't have led with calling this aqueduct maybe now that you were calling it streaming money because um it's just really cool to have your paycheck paid every second or a monthly subscription debited every single second and uh it's almost like it reminds me of subscriptions there's such a big mechanism in web 2 but if you take the you know i paid 9.99 a month for netflix and if you take a subscription down from monthly to weekly to daily to hourly to minutely to secondly you've basically got streaming money at that point so um yeah maybe maybe streaming money is the general high-level primitive here and it can be you know uh credibility and legitimacy and tokens can be streamed from any of these mechanisms to any of these other mechanisms yeah yeah i think so that's that's cool all right ranked choice voting yeah let's let's move on because we said we were going to do this in a half hour and we had we're yeah ranked choice voting let's go so ranked choice voting is super cool and actually there's a huge ranked choice vote happening right now at the ens dow or they're choosing someone to manage their endowment and so instead of going and saying this person is my favorite and the rest of them suck like just choosing uh a representative basically for your who you who you want to vote for the treasury uh you get to put in a little bit more context you can actually say well this is my preference preferred choice and if they don't win then i like this person to win and if they don't win then i'd like this person to win and and there's only four choices so it doesn't matter the last if the last choice wins then then hey you lost you know that's just how it is but what's cool about this ranked choice voting uh this mechanism is that they actually count the votes that way so in the traditional first pass the post voting system which is what we know in in our traditional democracies where it's like well you got to vote for biden or trump right uh okay well actually i don't want either of those guys i'd rather have this third party candidate but if i waste my vote on this third party candidate then the guy i don't like will win so i have to vote for the least evil that's probably going to win but with ranked choice voting you can put your third party candidate first and then put the lesser evil at the bottom of the list and when the votes are actually counted if your third party candidate doesn't has the least number of first place votes then then that vote is removed but your voting power your signal is still there so then now your second place vote is considered your top place vote and then they the account runs again and if uh this one you know has 50 percent of the vote uh or sorry the first time that a first place one has fifty percent of the vote then they win that's it and that's the end of that rounds uh but it's it's really cool because it actually allows for minority candidates to have a chance uh and and have some actual understanding of how many people appreciate them uh yeah and so i love ranked choice voting and actually token engineering commons kicked it up a notch and made it quadratic ranked choice voting because normally in ranked choice voting everyone gets one vote uh especially you know one person one vote kind of systems but we have tokens here and you know it's really [[quadratic voting]] is just better than plutocracy plutocratic voting so uh we i think it's for only time ever but uh we actually use quadratic ranked choice voting which is the same process but each vote is token weighted so yeah that was cool so i mean it feels like a real great mechanism for making perfect not the enemy of good and it ruins it it it it takes away the third party spoiler effect when you've got two major parties and um and and so that feels like that's what's really powerful about it i think if i if i'm not mistaken i've heard andrew yang say this is a way that we should do our primaries in in the united states and it may be getting some speed in the forward party that he's been doing they they actively use it in smaller in like local governments i i can't i think it's maine uses it in in in in a few of their um thing i can't remember anymore which states actually use it but i think there's a few that actually use this in their in their systems and it works really well when you have a large pool of candidates and you don't want to uh you know buy and and especially if someone's not going to get more than 50 by default then it works really well i don't think it works i don't it's a waste of time if you only have yes or no like it only really works for decisions that are like here's a list of candidates or a list of options and they're exclusive so we have to pick one rank the order of you know decide the futures that you think are best for you you know yeah yeah i mean i think that this is the one that you and i dm'd each other and we're like shoot we didn't cover this this is a really important mechanism so we got to do a part two yeah yeah but let's let's move on to staking and slashing yeah so another one that we were like oh wait we didn't cover this we should have is staking and slashing so basically uh eth just moved to proof of stake and the mechanism there is that you put 32 each up at stake and basically you run a validator and as long as that validator follows the protocol consensus route rules then it'll get a slight inflationary piece of the uh of the supply well inflationary in in some sense but the actual total network is deflationary for reasons that are external to this mechanism but basically it can be that your state can be slashed if you are uh if you if you lie so to the protocol so basically if you can if you do anything that could cause a consensus fork then uh then basically you can be slashed and you lose your deposit and there's also an inactivity leak where if you're offline for like a day or two you lose a couple of of guay a day and so basically it's a way of creating a crypto economic incentive to uh because money is at stake and can be slashed or increased at any time by the protocol it's a way of aligning capital with a certain set of outcomes and i i think that the ethalidators are a really kind of neat way of doing staking and slashing but there's lots of application examples of staking and slashing that are out there um i think that actually uh get coin and giveth have been experimenting with some form of staking at least with bitcoin i know that you could stake on certain grants for a little while that you thought were high quality and the algorithm would take that into account in in one of its sorting mechanisms on the ui and the sorting mechanism informs what gets funded so you know by staking your gtc you're actually able to push up and down the grants in the system but you all have y'all giveth have some staking uh implemented right yeah it's give power and so we're we're like a week from launching maybe two weeks from launching uh just some ux issues and then and then it's live but right now you can stake and lock and you end up getting this give power and so the longer you lock the more good power you get and also the higher your api your your staking rewards you could say uh that you earn for for locking and then with that give power you curate the projects on the platform so if you want to support your favorite non-profit project without donating you can actually just take give tokens effectively behind that project and then boom they'll end up with uh when we have our matching fun system they'll get more matching rewards they'll they'll be higher up on the list so people see them faster when they want to donate and and also uh what i mentioned before and actually the last episode was the the donor rewards the donation mining that uh is actually determined based on how much give power is locked behind uh each project so so it's i think like it's basically this this staking proving you have skin in the game you know that gives you the power to kind of man manage certain pieces of the project i think one inch does it too uh and with their uh with a few of their variables that you can change there's a there's a lot of projects that uh that where you stake and lock uh some kind of asset of value and that basically keeps you honest and i think it's it's a great mechanism yeah i think that um while we're talking about the processes and minuses of each mechanism i think it's really great if you have capital but that's the biggest downside is that it requires capital and therefore in a sense is a certain amount of plutocratic because if you're deploying to a population that isn't going to take their is living paycheck to paycheck or isn't gonna otherwise isn't going to put their capital into a staking mechanism then you've got the nothing at stake problem yeah yeah i mean i think this kind of monetary like plutocracy isn't so bad when you're managing a shared pot of funds right it's not it's not ideal i think quadratic plutocracy is better but in the end if you're dealing with financial input then having the people that are putting in financial um you know the financial power it's important to have it in there but if you're trying to you know figure out the laws of a country or you know the most decisions are not financial nature so these kind of mechanisms just wouldn't be a good idea hmm uh let's move on to the next one which i think is proof of work yeah proof of work is obviously this the the predecessor to proof of stake and staking uh which which is how bitcoin decides it's its distribution and you know people uh think proof of work you know how is this a collective resource allocation but actually uh you know they are choosing the four choice rule they're choosing over this [[public good]] that like which which blocks are actually the ones that uh are the truth and and the shared history but beyond that actually proof of work is used in a lot of other cool projects to distribute uh resources so uh there's the resource of course is inflation is the issuance i like this separation of issuance versus inflation inflation is like the experience of issues issuance affecting the market but um in issuance is just like hey we're we're throwing we're printing money you know uh and that actually doesn't always cause inflation if there's other dynamics involved so the the proof of work distributes issuance and if but sometimes the work is awesome right like a curecoin or folding coin they actually the proof the work that's being done is actually folding proteins for cancer research and and alzheimer's research and uh and then the people who fold more proteins actually get more issuance i i think proof of work you know starting in the digital space is super cool because it's very easy to be held accountable to the work that you're doing but in many ways we're actually taking proof of work to the next level in the [[public good|public goods]] space and we're trying to say hey let's let's use some of these other collective resource allocation to create a proof of work issuance in a way right where when when uh working work stream and get coin actually gets funding where did that money come from right it came from the dow what and that those tokens were not in the circulating supply at first so you could almost say that's a proof of work right this is being allocated uh using you know our [[public good|public goods]] legos are are piecing all these things together to actually make issuance affect more than just the digital space yeah i mean i think that you know uh there's a lot of power in proof of work and it's useful to remember that when proof of work has been mostly associated with bitcoin experiments like folding at home and other uh i think seti at home was the uh as an astronomy nerd when i was growing up one of the original og mechanisms of of of doing work for distributed network so uh i'm not a big fan of the carbon output on the bitcoin network but the fact that there are proof of work networks that are way more carbon neutral than bitcoin makes me not want to throw out the whole the whole category yeah there's actually a coin i don't know if it's even still around i think it was called grid coin or something that you could plug in any at home system and earn grid coin so you could do folding at home you could do study at home you could do uh the the at-home spectrum is is wide i think there's a lot of these cool and and i just love it because you're taking something that was altruistic and actually just flipping a switch and saying no actually it's economic and now uh boom people are actually doing it more like uh folding folding coin and curecoin have been number one on the folding at home like uh work board ever since they started uh just because they're printing magic internet money for the people who are participating and that's just more effective than altruism there you go i'm not gonna take i'm not going to take that bait we're not going to have another effect of altruism debate oh no oh no yeah i i uh just  __  posting all right i've got one more mechanism on the list try to take us through it yeah let's do it cool uh the next mechanism or i guess it's an attribute of mechanisms that i want to end on is decentralized identity so basically the promise of decentralized identity is well first off let's talk about the pitfalls we don't want to have plutocratic decentralized identity we won't don't want to have uh privacy uh privacy leaking or or privacy uh steamrolling uh identity we won't have sovereign digital identity but assuming that we have that protected privacy protected from plutocracy that you can take from site to site one of the big opportunities with decentralized identity is that we can now build systems that don't treat each of their participants as fungible with each other you can basically build mechanisms that are one human one vote which are inherently more democratic right we can go from one token one vote to one human one vote or really anything in between [[quadratic voting]] is actually just in between when human ones out and in one token one vote but you know if i wanted to build a um uh if i wanted to build a a system that that treats i don't know people who have contributed to get coin grants differently or people who have collected a specific pope differently then i can basically ring fence around those people that mechanism and i think that you know in order to build a more regenerative crypto economic internet there's actually this idea that we need to be able to have positive some games and uh repeat interactions with each other and so with identity we can accrue positive some reputation and build this virtuous cycle where i'm good to you there's a verifiable credential that has to do that you're good with me and that creates trust between the two of us and i think that that's really an exciting opportunity to complexify the design space of all the mechanisms that we've talked about in this episode and um and and i just think that like it just basically makes the design space probably an order of magnitude larger to be able to to drop these little markers of identity and you know maybe this bleeds a little bit into stigma g here like we're dropping these little little identity markers over time and because of that the system begins to accrue state over time so we can start to identify where the positive sum games are being played and that creates an economic gravity well that brings more people into the positive some games which makes the economic gravity well even bigger which in like the cycle just repeats itself until we have a regenerative crypto economic internet so that's why i'm really excited about about reputation yeah no totally right yeah civils like we need [[sybil resistance]] to do half of these things well that we're actually voting on right how horrible would it be if you do delegation you do a delegated democracy uh kind of approach and like for people that are being receiving votes are actually the same person uh that would be you know it's just a couple of uh nons but hey this is uh this is really scary it's it's crazy how much we've gotten done in the dow space without having something like get corn pass get coin passport really succeeding yet uh because we we need it so bad and there but there's so many great projects and this is why bitcoin passport is so cool because there's bright id there's idena there's uh in three polygon id is coming through there's uh what else is there there's so many uh you would know better like who are all the cool identity projects that are running oh man uh i i don't want to mention any of them because i might miss some of the good ones and i don't want to i don't want to do that but um the uh if you just search the greenpill episode history you can see like half the episodes we've done are about digital identity so there's a lot out there yeah and you know they don't i don't think i think we get a little bit hung up on oh it needs to be fully decentralized also just having uh real like central aggregating centralized identity solutions is also nice you know like uh the trusted seed is one where we just you know we've basically take applications and then like look to make sure that they're not degens that are just kind of you know gonna receive an airdrop and then dump it or anything like that and and then they become they can become a member of the trusted seed right and it's like okay we know you're a unique individual and and there's this like qualification and i feel like it would be nice to see uh you know more centralized identity reputation systems out so that we can aggregate them yeah because reputation is so important you know i i feel like a lot of these systems will benefit a lot more if uh you kind of intermix the plutocratic like side of it with something that you know can be earned but not sold you know and uh because there's so many people are like i have to you know maybe they get paid in gtc but they they need to sell it because you know and so now they don't have any voting power i mean that's that's just a flaw you know and we can do better and i know we will do better uh when we start integrating more when people build more reputation systems that are kind of um cross across across the dow space not like like there's reputation systems like for instance giveth has its uh inner give token which is like the if you work for giveth for three months straight then you can become part of the like uh foundation you could say that manages the treasury to pay the team right so we have like our own internal simple reputation system but that doesn't really help the space that's just for our own governance we need more cross functional reputation systems like uh which [[gitcoin grants]] for instance was used heavily for even though it wasn't made to be a reputation system people were dishing throwing airdrops to donors uh you know because get coin kind of had a civil protection a little bit and it was it was across the space so it had a lot of a lot more validity than something that's just internal to one project yeah yeah i mean i think there's so much to say about identity here but and it's definitely a category of mechanisms not a mechanism it's itself but um yeah i i there's probably where we could probably do a whole a whole another episode on identity mechanisms and maybe we should you've probably had like three greenpills on it but yeah so the last one i see on the list uh which you just added actually is uh web3 social yeah throw it out yeah so um we're talking about mechanisms for meeting our collective needs and um i i think that web3 social is a really interesting category of of things that can enable a more regenerative crypto economic world and uh you know i've been really excited to play with farcaster and mastodon and lens protocol basically anything other than twitter and facebook because of the sovereignty and privacy and the fact that you can take your social graph from site to site on things like lens and it's been interesting you know the problem with webcry social is that there's a [[network effect]] that needs to be built all of my friends are on twitter so i'm going to be on twitter so all my friends are going to stay on twitter and you need to build that with each with the web3 social ecosystem but uh i think that there's really a lot of opportunity once we've got our attention moved away from twitter and to web3 social what kind of things now that web3 social is out there and we own our own social graph and there's a forkability of the interface what kind of innovation does that enable and i'll just i'll just say i'll just kind of answer my own question there and just say that i did an early experiment with [[quadratic funding]] uh on bitcoin's news feed which kind of looks like a twitter news feed we replace the like button because i think that likes are like the ultimate  __  coin right you have unlimited of them and they only measure what gives you a dopamine rush and what we did was we put a micro tip button where you could tip someone 30 cents for uh adding value to the network and it turns out no one actually used that because who gives a  __  about 30 cents it's actually even it's it's like not even worth the cost basis of like recording that on my taxes but what we did was we were running mini [[quadratic funding]] rounds on the get coin news feed we took the same [[quadratic funding]] engine on [[gitcoin grants]] and we planted it at the get coin news feed and um what that did was i made your 30 cent tip into a ten dollar uh actual yield and and as soon as you've done that people are getting rewarded for actually being helpful on the platform and it was a really great way of getting people to just like help out with customer service and answering each other's questions this mechanism i saw the vibe on the bitcoin network i think we did it in january of 2020 this experiment and i saw the vibe of the getcoin network get much more positive and helpful to each other on the news feed because so like that's an example of like now that lens protocol is out there we could take the decentralized grants protocol and we could build [[quadratic funding]] on top of a social network a [[quadratic funding]] social network would be a social network that funds the [[public good]] and rewards people for being helpful to each other as opposed to just dunking on each other and getting likes because that triggers a dopamine response so the design space of web3 social enables a fractal forkability of innovation on web3 mechanisms because you don't have to be elon musk to be able to design mechanisms anyone [[open source]] can design mechanisms and that's the reason why think it's a [[collective intelligence]] tool once it's out there i don't know if you have any comments on this griff that was my little rant on web3 social no i think it's i think it's so such a critical piece it's almost uh it's like taking identity to the next level where where now you have the social graph on with it and yeah i i can't really not just like say everything you said in 10x because the ability to build on top of like just imagine if you could just use everyone's twitter account you know and you could build on top of that social graph how valuable it would be how valuable it would be for the various mechanisms that that we're creating uh i really hope that some kind of you know web3 native uh social graph exists right now the best we have is ens and people are building off of it and it's already very useful but it's not it wasn't made for that you know it's not it doesn't have as much stickiness as as a twitter or facebook so when when we have a web 3 native social so that hopefully lens because i just i don't want a new one i just want one i don't really care uh and this one's already there and it has seems to have a lot of support building hopefully this will take off and we can there will be so many interesting things that we can build off of it yeah amen oh i think that's true of all the space but web3 social particularly seems to have a lot of momentum and um you know i just look at like stani who's who's working on lens protocol and i think like this guy is clearly on a tear like he founded ave and he's like i'm done doing low hanging fruit stuff let me do something that's going to be truly hard and just like throw everything i got at it and like he's the founder of ave right so he's got lots of capital in in clout and momentum and stuff like that and so building lens protocol is like he's gonna make it so that anyone can build on top of web3 social whereas right now you either have to be elon musk or like someone who's had a previous exit to even give it a shot and so i think the democratization of web3 social but really all of these mechanisms enabled by web3 is what may makes me optimistic yeah i mean we're just gonna get better you know the our collective resource allocation has been so boring for the last 200 years it hasn't really been anything super exciting to come out since you know bitcoin and web3 kind of entered the scene so uh whatever we're working on now i mean i love that we just put all these things in one place i i hope that this can be inspiring for someone uh who's who's building the space to be like you know what let's try this for this one or let's try that maybe i can augment one of the this one and i can add this to it and it'll actually work you know yeah i mean i think that like the meta game here is kind of a the cambrian explosion of the byzantine general's problem being solved enabled an exploration a decentralized exploration of the design space of what are the network-based [[collective intelligence]] mechanisms that can be created and for what purpose and there's like this iterative evolutionary game where the a bunch of different agents i'm just using agents as like you know a way of saying like people like mew and me and everyone else who's in the ecosystem that are traversing the design space of what is possible here and and so one of the things that's really cool to me is like when i take a step back and i like look outside of the ecosystem is the iterative evolutionary game where every bear market a bunch of projects are going to fail but it's the ones that make it into the next market cycle that are going to be like the keystone species that are gonna um be the regenerative uh parts of the next ecosystem that are going to inform the next tranche of growth and there'll be an expansion and then there'll be another bear market from there where a bunch of those projects won't make it so there's this iterative evolutionary game in which we're traversing the mechanism design space and and i have this theory that like you cast the dice a thousand times and the degen projects like the ftxs and the three acs are just going to implode every single time because they're degenerate right their resource allocation is not is fragile and it goes down over time and it's going to be the regen projects that over time that are like long-term greedy that are going to be the ones that win if you you roll a dice a thousand times i think that you'll get that that outcome each time because these are intrinsic parts of of each of the systems so i don't know if you have any any feedback on that yeah i mean i 100 agree because in the end like there's there's the the djan market is already filled you know the region market has barely been we've barely cracked the surface there's uh so much more opportunity in in the regen space when governments and non-profits are spending upwards of 25 trillion dollars a year just burning it on trying to do collective resource allocation they're actually just losing money hand over fist and they don't because they don't have the web3 tooling to make it regenerative they're doing great work but they're using ancient systems that are not they're just they're not they're not actually coordinating effectively and with all of these mechanisms uh if if you're in the regent space and you start applying some of these into something that was traditionally only possible only really compete your only competitors are governments and non-profits and you're you're taking this this high level approach oh man yeah you're gonna kill it if ftx goes down people use binance or they use uniswap you know so i feel like there's just a lot more opportunity in the in the region in the refi space than there is than there is in in the rest of the space anyway yeah i mean i would i would agree that there is a um like there's more of a blue ocean john power always calls it like you've got the red ocean you've got the blue ocean the red ocean is already filled with blood and like animals and stuff so there's less space for you but like the blue ocean is wide open um and i would agree that regen is more of a blue ocean but i actually think that like it's fundamentally advantaged by the attributes of being regenerative over time is it that's a better competitive long-term strategy than like get rich quick stuff which will always shark fin and and will collapse from there so i mean i i think that those are two different reasons that are arguments for a more regenerative web 3 the next time around it's maybe just a maturity of of the ecosystems that are being built if only we could get the vcs to agree because the vcs just want to put money into all the mostly into the um into the ocean the stuff that they think they is more predictable of potentially venus success something they're more familiar with yeah the regions i really love this quotes this quote that talks about people will do uh humans will always do the most intelligent thing after they've tried every stupid alternative and none of them have worked that's a buckminster fuller quote and like i think the vc is like when there's when there's a category leader like how axi infinity got everyone into play to earn gaming gaming if there's like a region web 3 uh thing that has huge returns like the vcs are basically like herd animals not not all of them this is generalization but like investors in general are hurt animals and um you know once there's an example i think that that's that's when when people will catch up but that's a trailing indicator so it's up to mechanism designers like us to to be creating the leading indicators i think yeah well we'll do it we'll do it yeah well what's really growing ecosystem that grows together does it um the end of this so like i just want to start where we ended so better [[collective intelligence]] equals better commons resource allocation uh this is a huge a huge market if you look at how much governments and ngos and everything spends on [[public good|public goods]] we can make this market better by bringing it in a networked way and leveraging the properties of blockchain transparent global immutable incorruptible uh and really looking forward to hopefully seeing these mechanisms grow over the next couple years and we should do a mechanism roundup every year about what mechanisms were where uh we're excited about so thanks for being my huckleberry on this griff this was a lot of fun yeah it was a blast kevin thanks for having me man it was fun to do a two-parter yeah totally um i i think that uh uh i i think that it's gonna be a a real bonus to have the rest of these mechanisms in there so thanks for doing both part one and part two all right any parting words before we drop nah man this is great uh always a pleasure to hang out kevin cool all right enjoy your thanksgiving we will see you on the pod and catch y'all later coordination music thank you
