foreign music what's up coordination on the pod today we have eric voorhees the one and only of eric voorhees um og in the crypto scene has been building for over a decade in the crypto scene originally in the bitcoin space with satoshi dice and bit instant and most recently with shapeshift the company and then most most recently shapeshift the dow so eric and i share the commonality of trying to turn a company into a dao also we are both coloradians but we're pretty far across the political spectrum from each other i would code myself well i have many beliefs but i have been coded as a lefty uh eric is a proud libertarian and we talk in this episode about common ground not just common ground between different political beliefs and how blockchains and web3 enable new ways for libertarians to get what they want but also lefties to get what they want which is the funding of [[public good|public goods]] and more pro social types of causes but also cooperation across social distance and common ground across crypto tribes by virtue of shape-shift being an exchange that helps people exchange one token for another eric has kind of been an elder statesman or uh i guess whatever the crypto equivalent of an elder statesman is uh since eric is pretty anti-statist but uh eric has been sort of across different crypto tribes and is well respected by the bitcoin community the ethereum community and many other crypto communities as a leader and a pioneer in this space and so i'm just really interested in pulling the thread of common ground and cooperation across social distance not only from crypto tribes but also from people who have different political philosophies eric being a libertarian and me being kind of like a green lefty kind of person and so this episode is sort of exploring that design space of what's possible when you actually have conversations with each other and i think that this is a key part of building a regenerative crypto economic movement the broad water tent that we can build around using web3 to fund [[public good|public goods]] the better and if we just keep on building messages that resonate with people who look like me people from boulder colorado with like long hair and they're that are that are kind of like lefty then we're missing an important constituency of people who care about a libertarian type ideals and in this episode with eric is kind of an olive branch to that community in order to figure out the common ground between the those communities and i think that we're not as stuck as the conversations at least in the united states our national media feels very stuck like there's gridlock in washington between the left and the right and i think in web 3 there's a lot of opportunity to close out the old divisions and to create new momentum towards pro-social and uh and and pro [[public good|public goods]] causes and so we kind of traverse that terrain a little bit in this episode with eric it's a unique episode it's not like one that i've done before we're um really good at in some interesting conversations here so uh eric is an idol is a legend to me and to many in the crypto community and i think this was a fun episode so without further ado i give you eric voorhees the glow dollar is a news table coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty goes down glow is a dollar backed non-profit stable coin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company glow is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe reserve to give directly's basic income program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past with glow you can reduce poverty just by holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glodollar.org greenpill that's gro dollar dot org slash greenpill working in web3 is awesome but working outside of the typical w-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work tax time is coming up

tokens go to connect.opolis.co bankless to get started and if you're going to eat denver make sure to stop by the office booth or attend their few future of work summit hosted by opus eric what's up how you doing hey kevin i'm good how you doing pretty good really excited to have this conversation with you um about why you're in crypto and why i'm in crypto and hopefully we can build some cooperation across that social distance so um yeah what got you into bitcoin and and why are you here why are you in crypto yeah so uh yeah i fell down the rabbit hole in may of 2011. and um previously i'd been living in in dubai kind of right after college um moved there because there was no taxes at all and that to me seems um like a beautiful sign of good civilization so i moved over there and um it was during that time that the whole global financial crisis happened like 2008-ish um and so i got really interested in monetary economics how money works how banks work and uh came to the conclusion or at least started thinking that maybe the the big issue was that money itself was being centrally planned by um by a monopoly and um that if a market was going to function well probably money should be a market-based good instead of a coercion-based state good and um i just really didn't have like a lot of solutions for that i just felt the dismay that you know all the world's monies were essentially planned by governments um i was a fan of gold but realized that because it's it's physical it has to be stored in large you know vaults that are secure and so you can never really be like outside of the hands of the state um and then when i learned about bitcoin i realized that wow actually this is this is a possible alternative this is like a market-based money that can't get turned off you can send value anyone to any to anyone anywhere instantly at nearly zero cost and just fell in love with the whole thing and so um obviously it was a long shot that it would work out but i i was willing to to bet on it and to commit you know all my years since then to it so that's the genesis yeah so um maybe we could spend a couple minutes on the journey since then i know that you've been involved in founding some pretty innovative products and companies in in the crypto space so if you could kind of uh speed run us through through that that'd be great yeah uh so uh back in 2012 um i both joined bid instant which was i think the first like investor-backed company in in bitcoin um so charlie schrem started that in new york and i moved from new hampshire where i was there as part of the free state project down to new york to join charlie um to build bid instant with him and while i was at bid instant well bid instant for those who don't know was a way to move money very quickly to mount gox to move fiat money so mountains back then was the like really the only bitcoin exchange and it was in japan and so if you wanted to get fiat there it'd be like an international wire that would take a week or so so we had a way of letting people deposit money at various locations in the us and we would credit them like within a couple hours in with with our own money at mount cox it was quite cool and um it was around that time that i started uh satoshi dice and that was the world's most popular bitcoin gambling game it was half of all the bitcoin transactions from genesis block up until sometime in 2013. um so it was paying like half the mining fees of the whole network for first four or five years of bitcoin's existence and it got a little out of control um and i ultimately decided to sell it because i was getting somewhat well known in bitcoin by then and what i care about most with bitcoin is like this the change for good that i see that it can bring in the world so i was um a proponent and advocate of it and i recognized that if i was going to do that well i probably shouldn't also be running the world's biggest bitcoin casino like i kind of need to pick a path just for optics reasons so ended up selling satoshi dice back then and um after after bit instant and satoshi dice i was in panama for a year and then um after mount gox collapse started uh shape shift so that was back in 2014 shapeshift started as an exchange for people to convert one digital asset like bitcoin into another like litecoin this was pre-etherium and um it did it without custody so the the mount cox catastrophe weighed on me and almost destroyed the industry and shapeshift was an intent um to build an exchange for digital assets that did not require custody and um that had its whole story over the last eight or nine years and that's been um that's been my history with it yeah i i just think that the idea of a non-custodialist exchange is so groundbreaking and it's maybe something we take for granted i do a trade on uniswap or on the new version of shapeshift and the assets leave my wallet and there's some magic that happens and then the new assets come into my wallet but the state of the state at that time was not doing non-custodial transfers and i think did you all did you all pioneer that yeah i think we were the first ones to do a non-custodial exchange um obviously it couldn't work with fiat and so that was one of my decisions back then was like all the exchanges were fiat exchanges fiat to bitcoin and i you know bitcoin was like 95 or 98 of the market cap of all digital assets so um people thought it was a little strange to do an exchange just for digital assets like like that was two niche but i saw where the world was going obviously there was going to be lots of digital assets and um so yeah i think it was the first it was obviously before [[smart contract|smart contracts]] so the way it worked is that like it operated much like a vending machine so someone would send bitcoin the bitcoin would go to our wallet so we had a moment of custody and then we would send um you know the litecoin out to the user moments later so um people had to trust us only for the moment of the trade instead of the entire period of you know where their funds were being held which just you know reduced by three orders of magnitude the risk to the user right and we didn't we also because we cared about protecting people we also didn't take their personal information so we had no kyc and um that became very controversial but it was something that was important to me because um yeah if someone's not even accused of a crime i shouldn't have to take their personal information period right well i mean you know one of the things that so i mean i think a thread for this episode for me is cooperation across social distance and you know one of the major arcs that i want to get into in this episode is like your sort of libertarian values in my more leftist values but but before we get into that i just want to know the cooperation across social distance that happens with shapeshift because shape because crypto is inherently tribal industry as anyone who spent any time on crypto twitter knows there is people from coin a that talk about how coin b is a  __  coin and vice versa and there's these narrative battles for the future of digital assets and one of the things that has always attracted me to you as a thinker and the philosopher and executor in the space is that you're very pluralistic about assets and and i don't know which came first sort of that philosophy um or shape-shift a business that was built on that philosophy a fee but i've always just appreciated that you'll stand up to maximalists of of all different crypto tribes and um you're kind of a nexus for cooperation across social distance in the crypto industry because you're above any specific asset i don't know if you have anything to say about that thanks yeah i appreciate you saying that um yeah i mean it comes from my interest in all of this which which was based on principle like i am in this space because of principle because of the principle of desiring an open financial system for the world and whatever tools allow that to happen better i am in favor of so i fell in love with bitcoin because it was the first plausible tool that actually enabled that um i've fallen in love with ethereum because it can do things the bitcoin can't do and it works differently and in different beautiful ways i love the privacy coins like monero and z cash because they actually let people be anonymous and i love seeing just all the innovation that is happening because people are truly building like a decentralized financial system and if you value decentralization how can you not appreciate multiple blockchains being built in different ways by different teams with different assumptions many of which will fail obviously most tokens are totally stupid and most projects are going to fall apart that's just part of how innovation works that's not unique to crypto but to be wedded to um any specific asset instead of the principles i think is really missing the point and it's always bothered me to see these tribalists they spend more time arguing between bitcoin or ethereum instead of realizing that like these two systems are complementary like they rise and they fall together they are not eating each other's lunch they help and enable each other i i love that bitcoin has remained proof of work and i love that ethereum has moved to proof of stake i think the the diversity of those two consensus mechanisms is part of the strength of this ecosystem because each has pros and cons um and i just see these as like you know mutually beneficial things and i wish people would stop fighting among themselves and realize that the actual the actual enemy are the banks and the government's uh the fiat financial system not other [[open source]] developers i'd love to to pull that thread um just knowing what the arc of this episode is uh i'm wondering if you can talk about why the banks in the government are the enemy i wonder if you can talk about why coercion at the foundation of state power is a bad thing just sort of those principles that you've been adhering to since the start of getting into the crypto space i'm wondering if we can if we can dive into those for a few minutes yeah um so yeah fundamentally everyone has to make some assumptions on how the world should work and they have to make some moral and ethical assumptions and then build a world view around it and um my assumption is is simple or my my premises which is just that uh it is better when humans are peaceful with each other that uh we should respect each other as individuals we should not cause each other harm i shouldn't hurt you you shouldn't hurt me i shouldn't steal your stuff um and you know i shouldn't commit fraud against you like these kind of very basic things that 99.9 of people agree with um that's the the fundamental essence of my whole philosophy and everything else all the other details are just sort of a logical extension of that you know why am i anti-taxation because you're stealing from people and we can discuss you know why i define it in that way but it comes from that principle of respecting your fellow man and um and not harming them so um yeah that's that's why i think that a money system needs to maintain fidelity to that principle if you have a fiat currency system where coercive laws from the government are not quite forcing people to use and hold but certainly legally encouraging people to use a financial system that is debased um i find that to be highly unethical i mean it's essentially the world is close to force to being used fiat currency and then certain people with certain privileges are able to print as much of that stuff as they want they get the benefits before the price levels in the economy generally rise and everyone that holds the asset and works for the asset largely the the poorest uh and least educated among the world are the ones that suffer from that currency debasement i think it's one of the worst scams frauds injustices of the world and so when i see bitcoin and i see a system that is open immutable and that everyone can access with the exact same rules in the same way um no one's forced to use it it doesn't have any special legal privileges it is purely a money of the market um to me that is where the virtue of these things come from and that's true whether we're talking about bitcoin or ethereum so one of the arguments that i heard in there was this argument against against theft and and i think that there's there's sort of two examples of how fiat money enables theft one is taxation is theft uh because people didn't consent to being taxed taxed and then the second is debasement of the currency which creates inflation of the currency is theft and those to me feel like arguments from first principles i did not consent to my monetary system being debased or me being taxed so therefore is theft that feels like a first principle's argument to me but i also heard a causal argument in there that feels very pro-social to me and as a as like kind of a lefty i'm really interested in that as well because you said that the people who are debasing the currency get the benefits of that new currency before the poor uh in in that feels like an economic justice social justice causal argument um against those things and and and and and and so um i i i just think it it's it's kind of interesting to think that um there's kind of like a i i don't see it often in the media but there's a there's kind of like a social justice argument um against fiat currency in there and and i don't think that i've ever heard that from you or other libertarians before maybe i just wasn't listening for it yo uh well people on the left love to use this word access like people have people should have access to health care or access to birth control um often access is used as a euphemism just to cover up the fact that it's an issue of poverty that like everyone has access to health care it's just a question of whether you can afford it um so it's but that word access is used i think because people like like the idea that something is available um sort of equally across all people and and it's interesting when those that are not part of the crypto world don't apply that to the money system itself right so if we're talking about the value of equal access to something and we want to literally use the term access um none of us have equal access to the fiat financial system if you're a bank with a banking license you have privileges over that system to create money literally out of thin air like when a bank creates a loan for your mortgage most people don't realize this but they make the money at the bank when you get the loan um it's like just counterfeiting money but because they have a special license from the state they get to do that if you did that or if i did that we'd go to jail similarly the central bank obviously has even greater powers than that um similarly you and i can't like access uh the flows of money in the fiat financial system we can't pull it up on an open blockchain and view all the money moving around the world right we don't have access to the information of the flows whereas the banks do so we can't create it we can't access the information behind it and um this creates a huge disparity between people who otherwise should be treated equally and um what's so cool about crypto is that it didn't require anyone to like vote in the old system to approve it it's just this alternative system that's sitting there usable by anyone who opens their eyes to it and everyone has equal access to it and not just everyone in america but like the entire world doesn't matter what color your skin is it doesn't matter how much money you have it doesn't matter what country you're born into doesn't matter what religion you are or what sexual orientation you are like nothing matters other than you following the same objective rule set as everyone else and to me like that is that is true equality and absolutely something that i think the the libertarians and the leftists within the crypto community should align on um i just want to kind of check on that framing a little bit because i know that you and i did a panel at east denver last year about 11 months ago and david hoffman was moderating it and i think that he kind of presented me as the leftist at the table and you as the libertarian at the table and that might be too reductionist because i think that um i have a superposition of beliefs across the political spectrum i just happen to have long hair and talk about [[public good|public goods]] a lot so maybe people code me on the left and and i guess i'm asking like is coding is coding you on the political spectrum as a libertarian true reductionist no i'm absolutely a libertarian uh in a very extreme one so i happily embrace that label i can define what it means i think interestingly it's very i think a lot of people on the left or the right often if you ask them like what it means to be on the left to the right they they don't quite have a consistent answer um and it's interesting to watch people on both sides of that spectrum take conflicting views that don't actually adhere to a single principle yeah um my principle is just as i mentioned before that people should be peaceful with one another and everything everything that i believe comes down to is sort of trying to fit it to that i'm wondering if we can talk about as far as i i've read some libertarian philosophy and it feels like this idea that taxation is theft is rooted on this idea that the government has a monopoly on violence so basically the implication of that is if you do not pay your taxes then you'll be thrown in jail uh and guns will be pointed at you and and i'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the monopoly on on violence and um is that at the root of the sort of libertarian um problem with with government is is that basically um the monopoly on violence is is a violation of that principle that people should be peaceful with each other yeah and that you know sort of all violence is a violation of that principle sometimes violence can be justified so i'm not a pacifist in that regard but um the bar should be very high to justify violence and i think one thing that might help people is society is very large and complex and people kind of are born into it with all these understandings and and memes and norms and if you actually just reduce the the space of consideration to a smaller set you can see these principles very easily so take for example like a society of or like a you know a desert island of 10 people and they all find themselves there no help is coming and they're all just like trying to survive in the wilderness on the island um i think most people would agree that none of those people should like harm each other right like that should be a good principle and um if if six of the people uh all raised their hands and voted for those six people to rule the four i think most people would have a problem with that they'd be like well hold on a second why do the six of you get to rule the four but that's just that's democracy so i'm also not a fan of democracy as a principle and um i think when you when you take that set of 10 people on the island most people are like especially if you cast it like um with with men and women that it becomes even more visceral you know let's say there's four women and six men um to what degree do those six men have the right to do whatever they want to the women just because they outnumber them right i think they don't have any right to do anything to the women the women are individuals and it doesn't matter if it's six men or a hundred men like the women should be respected as individual people it doesn't matter if a vote is taken to violate them um and to me that seems obvious on the example of the desert island but somehow when you expand it from 10 people to 350 million uh most throw that idea out the window and they think anything that is democratically voted is fine and um that's i think where a lot of the the conflict comes from so what is the um is there is there sort of like is this idea in um neoliberal neoliberal philosophy or an argument that's put forth uh that's abbreviated as tina there is no alternative and you know i i guess that's that's my question for you is is is there an agarist uh alternative to civilization at scale um algorithm being a social philosophy and creating a relation uh a society in which all relations are voluntary exchanges without the state uh sort of forcing anyone to do anything like is is there a counter factual version of of the united states or the world or colorado that is more agarist that is there a social philosophy that that has scaled that that looks more in in that vein is a good question and i think before addressing that question it's important to at least like agree on the moral principles before talking about the empirical results um because i think it'd be reasonable for people to say look i agree that um the sick should not be able to vote on whatever they want and harm the four i agree that that's morally correct but they must do it for x y and z practical reason or empirical reason or whatever um that's at least an intellectually honest way to proceed um so i think if you're looking at like what are the what are the consequences and what are the alternatives there's all sorts of counter factuals and there's also examples of like the efficacy of larger governments for smaller governments so you can see this all over the world like to use the the us for example u.s has a much larger government today than it than it used to um the entire industrial revolution of america and its period of fastest growth and greatest wealth creation happened in the 19th century specifically in the latter part of the 19th century after slavery was abolished and um that happened without any income tax that happened with a small national government it happened with very little interference from government into the lives of ordinary individuals and um there's examples throughout the world right like hong kong versus china or south korea versus north korea um you know switzerland versus other countries in in europe generally when you have people permitted freedom societies tend to thrive um more than those societies which resort to central control and violence of things there's obviously counter examples that that work against that but as a general trend throughout history and across the world i i feel like that's fairly apparent and so from my perspective both the moral argument and the empirical argument toward respecting individuals um as sacred i think is is a compelling one yeah i i i think that that's interesting i the engineering me wants to have like a little bit more of like case studies on both sides and then we can maybe pull apart the um the different attributes of them and what caused the societies to grow but you know what comes to mind for me is can we click on that for a second because like if we go back to the island with the 10 people and the four women yeah i mean imagine the the engineer among them right a male of course who is saying well if the women do not comply like we won't be able to have babies and the society will die out thus we have justification to rape the women right like that's that's an engineer that's from an engineering perspective that's correct um and yet good people should feel kind of disgusted by that so yeah the problem with with these societies is when people decide like i want to engineer how others live because i believe that there's x y and z benefit you violated the rights of that person as an individual and that's a really slippery slope yeah well i mean it's like the engineering me wanted to find like more examples of does economic growth correlate with big government or small government um with respect to your example on the island i think that a pluralism of approaches to like in the united states we don't just have rule by the majority we also have the constitution and the bill of rights and so to reduce reduce that doubt well yeah to reduce that down to the island i mean a world in which the majority rules but people have certain inalienable rights um limits what the majority can do to to the minority right yeah and that's that's a huge step forward you know that's why like the the constitution and the bill of rights were so important uh the the problem is that they haven't been respected as much as they should and arguably they don't protect as much as they should but that idea that there are things that the majority can never vote on because they're inalienable to the individual that's that's huge and you know i obviously think that the the scope of things that should be inalienable to the individual is is quite large yeah it kind of comes back to immutability uh when it comes to enforcement of the bill of rights these are inalienable rights they're immutable rights yes but but unlike a blockchain these are just words written by politicians and they get degraded over time as people both forget about why they were there and also because they find you know um reasons to degrade it so this comes back to an idea josh stark who's at the ethereum foundation wrote this amazing post about where hardness comes from in the world hardness being um basically a uh source of of uh confidence that things will continue to be a certain way and his point was that hardness comes from atoms and institutions and blockchains so like the hardness of atoms means that there will only be so much gold on earth no one can make more more gold without spending a lot of energy institutions from the dmv to the united states government uh to the constitution are enforced socially and then blockchains are for enforced technologically and then kind of like socially below that so it kind of comes down to where does the hardness or confidence that this will be enforced come from i think in both of these views yeah and then there's a spectrum there you know certainly like the physics of atoms is is completely hard like it follows um rules that are not violated blockchains are quite close to that like maybe all the way there like they operate on their on their code precisely as as is written um and yes their rules can change but that the rules can change is one of the rules so that's actually not a violation right what you know about blockchains is that they will always operate according to the code and this is a very powerful feature that people really haven't appreciated yet in terms of like if you care about law and order uh blockchains are incredible because they execute the rules objectively 100 all the time most people think of you know crypto as sort of an anarchic world a wild west of these crazy libertarians that like just don't like rules and that's so not that's so not true at all you know the bitcoin is is a harder set of rules than anything that the united states government uh has ever created and will ever create so i think arguing it from a point of like um we care about order and rule and thus we like blockchains i think that's a that's a compelling case yeah i want to introduce one more sort of a knowledge primitive um to the conversation and and that's this post uh by vitalik about legitimacy um have you read this one no so so basically vitalik uh sort of claims here that legitimacy is a pattern of higher order acceptance an outcome in a social context is legitimate if the people in that social context play their role in enacting that outcome so um legitimacy according to vitalik in this post uh can be achieved by brute force which is you know i think what you would argue well i want to put words in your mouth but maybe someone would argue that uh the the government uh the us government does we have a monopoly on force and therefore we can enforce legitimacy there can be legitimacy by continuity legitimacy by fairness legitimacy by process by performance and by participation so um for me a lot of this value space that you and i are talking about right here is kind of like different narrative frames on where legitimacy comes from and where it does not come from um and and so i feel like this is an important knowledge like if we're going to build cooperation across social distance because um a lefty like me might say oh well uh if we fund [[public good|public goods]] with taxes that's legitimacy by performance and and and maybe by process um and someone on the other side of the spectrum would say like that's illegitimate because um from first principles taxation is theft so i mean we'll get into the sort of disagreements between those things but i just want to introduce the idea of legitimacy higher order social acceptance as an important primitive in a lot of the examples that were that we're talking to how does that resonate with you that's fair i think legitimacy um isn't a universal um so it's a very subjective judgment so uh i might judge an outcome to be illegitimate or legitimate and you might disagree and that's that's okay um like i think it's hard to to cast it as a universal that something is is legitimate or not because of one reason across all people it's a i think it's an assessment that every individual has to make on a certain outcome and they can use those those factors you know the metallic highlights in the judgment of whether they think it's legitimate or not yeah well uh we have 25 minutes left and i really want to get to the meat of the discussion which is the healthy tension between um what i would see is well look um i think that you have good arguments from first principles that taxation is theft and um that people shouldn't go be coerced into having their money taken from them i think that people on the left who care about pro-social causes who care about environmentalism things that i would call [[public good|public goods]] um have a good reason that we want to fund [[public good|public goods]] we're having this conversation for example over the internet which was invented by arpa which is funded by a government grant so you know like for me the argument that we want to fund [[public good|public goods]] is like hey wouldn't you pay 20 of your salary to have a one thousand percent better world um which you know we'll get into debating those numbers i'm sure but the opportunity that i see eric and the reason i wanted to do this podcast with you is that what if we could fund [[public good|public goods]] without coercion from governments then we could unite the libertarians and the lefties like me around creating a world in which our commons are well funded but we don't need to use coercion in order to do it and maybe you know there's a world in which when i fund the the like instead of just paying my taxes and it goes to whatever the bureaucrats want i can like have a check box where i give to the collective and i say i want to fund the potholes in my community center but not the war in the middle east or something like that um and so and and so you know i'm trying to build this cooperation across social distance between the people who are in your camp and the people who are more in my camp and i'm just wondering how can how can we do that does crypto enable that is there a window of opportunity am i the only one who sees it and yeah i know that there's a lot there but that's where i'd love to spend the next 25 minutes well yeah i mean just just the recognition that it's a good thing to fund [[public good|public goods]] without coercion is great i mean that's a virtuous statement that i would stand behind 100 percent um yeah let's find ways to fund the [[public good|public goods]] without coercion like that's a that's a libertarian perspective absolutely you know certainly libertarians aren't opposed to [[public good|public goods]] um they're not opposed to the environment they're not opposed to roads they're not opposed to the internet they are opposed to coercion and so um yeah i mean that's that's a good way of starting that discussion for sure so um i really want to pinch and zoom on that point it makes me so excited for you to say that eric because you sent this tweet in february of 2022 that said like i love [[public good|public goods]] and obviously they're critical to deny [[public good|public goods]] is to deny the error that we breathe and i think that holy  __  that made me so excited that there's an opportunity here for like this podcast episode but generally like cooperation across people who view legitimacy as derived from very different places and it you know i i guess i'm i'm just like want to ask the question like how can we build this world where we fund [[public good|public goods]] in this way well i think it's important to point out maybe where we might differ on something here which is that i i would like a world where there's as few [[public good|public goods]] as possible and yet i acknowledge that some exist right air being a great a great one um but the environment generally being a good one um but i think uh humans work best when things are privatized because it aligns the the native self-interest that people have with the outcomes um so i want to reduce the scope in which something is considered a [[public good]] but i know that that scope can't be reduced to zero and there's a lot of things that i'm curious if you call them [[public good|public goods]] so like for example is the ethereum blockchain a [[public good]] in your in your view um you know what's fun is that uh since i founded getcoin which is all about [[public good|public goods]] uh uh i started getting tagged in all these uh twitter debates where it was like hey kevin this has a grant is it a [[public good]] and i was expected to like go on record about all these different things and um the fun part about bitcoin being a dow is i could be like uh like go take a hike the dow could decide um but i can't dodge that here i can't i can't do that dodge here with you it will emerge from consensus yeah yeah and um so yeah uh to actually answer your question and not get into like some meta commentary about where legitimacy comes from um dao processes or the founders vision um i actually think that there's a lot of things that are on a spectrum of public private goods uh ethereum is a double-sided marketplace between um people who are writing to the blockchain and people who are reading to the blockchain this is overly reductionist but like anyone can read from the state of ethereum and figure out what the global consensus is and do it for free and that is a [[public good]] but the ability to broadcast a transaction and write to the chain requires money and it is excludable and rivalrous and so it's not a [[public good]] and so you know the hyper object of ethereum is this double-sided or maybe triple-sided market depending on how you count it in one side is a [[public good]] and another side is like this privatized market good interesting so does a does a [[public good]] require as a prerequisite that it's that has free access so [[public good|public goods]] the economics definition is something that is non-rival risks and non-excludable so um i am breathing air right now and the fact that i am breathing air does not create a rivalrousness with you eric that you can breathe air and i cannot exclude you from breathing clean air and that's what makes clean air a [[public good]] is that it's non-rival and non-excludable so roads and water are not [[public good|public goods]] yeah so um there's actually a two by two matrix if you google [[public good|public goods]] and you click on uh images you'll see a two by two matrix where there's excludable non-excludable and rivalous non-rival risks um roads are i think in the in uh they're they're non-excludable because anyone can really drive onto them um but they're rival risks in that they only have limited capacity and the technical economics name for that is is a common good so something that's that's scarce but like it's pretty hard to exclude gotcha okay understood yeah so um to me the i want to go back to what you said about the the main point of diff difference because we're going to build this cooperation across social distance we should spend time on where there's the most difference um you said that you wanted to minimize [[public good|public goods]] and as many things that should be privatized as possible i don't want to put words in your mouth is is that fair yeah like uh take health care for example um i don't think people have a right to health care the reason is because it has to be provided by someone so to say you have a right to it is to say someone else has an obligation to provide it to you which is slavery and um i don't believe in slavery because i believe people should be peaceful with each other um so that's that's an example of something that i would call like not not a [[public good]] should not be treated as a [[public good]] um there's i think there's a lot of things that those on the left would like to call [[public good|public goods]] and i'm not claiming that you're one of them but they'll throw anything that people want like kind of any base needs that people have as [[public good|public goods]] because then once you do it you justify all kind of um coercion in granting those to people so food education healthcare roads internet um you know i've heard people say cell phones are like a [[public good]] and and people have a right to them so that that kind of goes off in some interesting directions but um yeah i want to because [[public good|public goods]] are tricky i want to limit the scope of them and then actually tackle the ones that are the most difficult and certainly environmental pollution i think is is the most important of those yeah um so i mean i i think just like recognizing that they're tricky and why they're tricky is maybe the highest leverage point for this conversation because then that like everything else derives from that so in my mind [[public good|public goods]] are tricky because because they're non-excludable and non-river risk that means that it's hard to build a business model for protecting them and we know from eleanor ostrom's uh eight principles of protecting the commons is that you need to be able to gate people's like access to them if you're going to maintain them over the long term and so for me the the biggest problem with [[public good|public goods]] is that there's no business model for maintaining them which means that we all go get jobs at like jp morgan or some like private company so that we can pay our mortgage so that we can get food on the table so that we can access education and health care which means that um there's not money or capital flowing back to the commons absent a course of government forcing people to do it but the flip side of that to me is that there's no feedback mechanisms about which [[public good|public goods]] we actually care about because no one is paying for them it's just left to some like central state planning bureaucrat to figure out which [[public good|public goods]] tax dollars should go to and the most beautiful thing for me about markets is that you get this [[collective intelligence]] mechanism of like wow people really love shapeshift and therefore shapeshift has more capital to invest in making shapeshift better and it creates this virtuous cycle where like shapeshift uh does even better and so what if there was a way to combine the [[collective intelligence]] of markets um with this sort of like non-excludably non-non-rivalrousness of [[public good|public goods]] that feels like it would be the best of both worlds to me but i don't know you said [[public good|public goods]] are tricky that's what comes up for me when i think about [[public good|public goods]] being tricky i'm curious what comes up for you in terms of why [[public good|public goods]] are so tricky yeah i think you you defined that well like who the issue is the tragedy the comments generally yeah like who who takes care of the thing when it's when it's a [[public good]] um and you know part of i think what helps in the discussion is to define specific [[public good|public goods]] and talk about those right like uh is there a universal way to solve the problems of [[public good|public goods]] writ large um that sounds like a tall order but to take a specific one and to try to figure out solutions to solve that one in particular uh is certainly a noble goal yeah um well yeah i mean i think that like the crypto the vision that i see emerging out of the crypto ecosystem is a very holonic uh way of funding [[public good|public goods]] hollands are this idea that um every every everything is both a part and a hole in itself you know for example like i'm kevin i'm an individual you're eric you're an individual together and with other people in the crypto community we make up the colorado crypto community and then we're part of this greater whole which is the colorado community and um so if i have like hollands are just basically drawing a circle around um groups of of of of of of other hollands and um the holonica view of of funding [[public good|public goods]] is like to find a define a border around a community and to find a mechanism for distributing capital to [[public good|public goods]] in a funding source for distributing uh capital [[public good|public goods]] and like you know the example of uh like we could just use the example of ethereum the [[public good]] of uh the consensus mechanism of the ethereum network is um is determined by the consensus algorithm of of proof of of proof of stake and the funding mechanism is that people who are doing the rights to the network are taxed are sub or are subsidizing the [[public good]] of the entire network and that's like the whole on of the ethereum network um i wouldn't use the word text but i won't be pedantic about it sure yeah i i um and then like there's other [[public good|public goods]] in the ethereum space like who maintains geth in prism and um you know who funds the up and coming innovation in the ecosystem that's kind of like what [[gitcoin grants]] is trying to be uh along with giveth and clr fund and others is like create a mechanism and a funding source for the other [[public good|public goods]] that aren't just like the transactional securement of the network so i might be belaboring the point but i think that the key part the key point to like how we fund [[public good|public goods]] in an agoric way is drawing a whole lot around what the [[public good]] is and then finding a funding source and a mechanism for distributing uh those [[public good|public goods]] and so using that frame well first off i'm curious if you have any feedback on that it might it might be overly complicated but um you know maybe we could actually object level talk about some [[public good|public goods]] and how they could be funded in a non-coresive way using using that view yeah i mean i i think there's a huge untapped channel of using people's social desire for recognition and um reputation in in funding philanthropic endeavors generally yeah um like if you go out into the world and you see random strangers or you interact with people in your business or like on [[social media]] there's no demonstration in any meaningful way of what those people are contributing to and this is partly because it's just sort of like a social faux pas but wouldn't wouldn't it be cool if like if you went to my twitter profile and it showed like some badges of the things that i've contributed resources to and maybe including how much i've contributed yeah and i would show those because i want to like say i care about these things and and look i'm putting my money where my mouth is on blockchains these things can be proven yeah and there's there's none of that like there's no social there's no social custom of demonstrating that you care about these things um and i wish that was the case you know and i i certainly don't know how to change the way society works in that regard but i wish it was more acceptable and i wish people tried harder to to demonstrate what they have put resources to and this is actually like a skin in the game question right because you can go on facebook and people will post all sorts of words about what they support right because words are cheap you know they'll post the the ukraine flag on their profile and suddenly they're like a war hero and um there's just like there's no there's no teeth to it so i wish we could get to a place where teeth were there and people would demonstrate things like financially and how how effective it actually was yeah um well you know the what this excites me because a tweet that i've sent in the past is like web2 is about virtue signaling uh and web3 could be about proof of virtue um and it's the exact same view like you go to someone's tinder profile and you see all the virtues that they actually have cryptographically proven um twitter profile you know whatever the social presence that you have you can have uh instead of poapps proof of proof of participation you can have you know proof prove a virtue and i think that that could be a really powerful um powerful thing to build um but but you know you know i i think that um the funding sources are only one half of the equation you have to find ways to raise money for [[public good|public goods]] but then you have to route that money to the [[public good|public goods]] that are actually legitimate and so you know i i support ukraine because i gave a thousand die uh is is like one thing but like how did ukraine like how is that actually distributed did they go to ukraine dao or did it go to some uh administrative charity that takes 89 um off the top for administrative overhead this is the other by the way big opportunity i see with crypto and funding networks is that you can run a network a philanthropic network using blockchain and use the properties of blockchains of transparency and immutability uh in order to create way more effective organizations but less overhead organizations when it comes to actually distributing the capital and to me like removing intermediaries is where it's at like i find the charity i don't wanted to go to the administrative overhead of that charity i wanted to go to creating object level impact that's another opportunity for crypto i see yeah well this is why dallas can exist now is because like the the friction of moving money around and knowing where it is and accounting for it um has gone down drastically like dallas dallas can't work without blockchains um they you know they they only exist because of what blockchains have done to the ease and the frictionlessness of of funding and so there's no reason that those those benefits shouldn't accrue in other areas yeah absolutely well eric you've been really generous with your time i think that we've only got seven minutes left on our booked time i i can go a few minutes over but i i don't want to put you in that position um is there anything that i didn't ask that you want to say or you know anything that you know if you had an audience of 7 000 sort of like crypto lefties that you would want them to want them to hear um yeah i think um you're kevin leading by example here in attempting to find common ground among people who care about similar projects and i think that's a really that's a really important goal right so for the for the seven thousand lefties listening to this um try to figure out like what you really care about and find the people who who can help with those ends even if even if they don't agree with you and i think this is an important lesson in crypto generally the ends that we're all pursuing here is this like open decentralized financial system and that is true of the most hardcore bitcoin maxi or the you know like rainbow unicorn wearing youth leftist um and everyone and everyone else like focus on those principles and try to build common ground i think that's that's like a that's a key virtue of humans generally is when they cooperate and we have these amazing tools of blockchains that allow us to cooperate at scale with huge economic power and if we let if we let ideologies cause us to create tribal divisions that don't need to be there i think that's a disservice to everything so um it's a long-winded way of just saying thank you kevin for for caring about like building bridges and um i hope other people are inspired to do the same yeah well same to you eric i mean obviously you're an og in the space and you've pushed the envelope of innovation with satoshi dice and shapeshift with non-custodial exchanges but also shapeshift becoming a dao i think you're pushing the envelope of um but and and you're pushing the envelope of common ground in cooperation across social distance by being an anti-tribal sane voice in the bitcoin and ethereum and other crypto communities but i also just want to thank you for doing this podcast with me um i think that you reshuffle the dice uh a thousand times and people like me and people like you don't get to have uh uh time together in order to really resolve our distance our our differences and to build that common ground um i think that 900 times out of a thousand it's just like a twitter flame war uh on [[social media]] and if we can find a way to build that cooperation across social distance um in the 21st century that's that's one of the things that would make me so bullish for for humanity so um again you're leading by example and thanks for for uh joining me yeah no problem um really appreciate that and this is sort of why i hold this view of peace between individuals being so fundamental is because i i think you can cooperate and build common ground when two people start on the understanding that they won't harm each other and this is like a very primal precondition but if two people are willing to say like i respect you i'm not going to hurt you or steal from you and if you give me the same respect um we can disagree about everything we want but we know that we're safe with each other and we can find ways to build together and i think that's that's really key that's where cooperation comes from and ultimately most of human progress it's a great place to end thanks again for joining me eric thank you kevin cheers thank you music foreign music
