foreign music ation today on the pod we have colectivo which is a tool a movement and a community that is enabling autonomy in local communities that want to regenerate their commons basically they issue geo nfts which are which are nfts which collect value via environmental monitoring underlying the material reality in local communities so you can [26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=26.18s)

think about using a collectivo geo nft to financialize the health of your coral reefs or the biodiversity of your local economy and then that creates an incentive for people to come in and to take care of the commons and that boosts the value of their nfts so how can we use web 3 finance in order to create [[local currency|local currencies]] local community incentives to fund the [[public good]] and i'm just so here for this world where we're building a pluralistic modular civilizational skill infrastructure for supporting the commons and [[public good|public goods]] and what's really cool to me is how tools like tivo stack on top of a bunch of other regen web 3 tools that could give a systemic incentive to the world's regions degens and just everyday people to support their their commons and we [70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=70.979s)

want to make it cool and profitable to support the commons and to do good so uh luke is just really articulate and passionate about this use case we talk a lot about taking web3 and getting outside of our bubbles and using it in local communities in this episode and uh the fact that colectivo and luke already have a pilot on the ground in in luke's hometown i think is really really cool [93](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=93.42s)

so um really really liked this episode and i think that you're going to too without further ado i'll give you luke from colectivo enjoy working in web 3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical w-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what [112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=112.799s)

they do best their work while managing the back end for them there is a lot of nation-state overhead when working in web 3 and opolis takes care of all of the back end stuff freeing you up to do what you do best office leverages group buying power through a community employment co-op helping you save 20 to 50 percent on high quality affordable healthcare options through cigna so do [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=133.62s)

what you love and maintain your financial security with opolis you must be authorized to work in the united states to receive office benefits but opus is expanding its services to canada starting on january 1st 2023. so book a 30-minute consultation with the oculus experts and join opus by december 31st of 2022 and get a thousand work tokens and a thousand bank tokens when you sign [154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=154.98s)

up so go to connect.opolis.com bankless to get started goldfinge a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to connect the world's capital to the world's growth goldfinch focuses on real yields from real companies so start lending your usdc to real businesses driving growth worldwide goldfinches borrowers are proven fintechs and credit funds and [175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=175.739s)

emerging markets who need access to goldfinches capital to drive economic growth in regions faced with barriers to financial access in just under two years goldfinch has loaned over 100 million usdc reaching over a million people in businesses across 28 countries goldfinch is doing what d5 was always meant to do expanding financial access to those who have historically been shut out of the [196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=196.319s)

get started all right hey luke how's it going really well how are you doing kevin pretty good thanks really keen to talk to you about colectivo tell us about it tell us about it in one sentence we're enabling autonomy in local populations by building a toolkit that creates a network of regenerative economies beautiful um what uh like like tell us more we don't we don't need to have to sit down to to just one sentence do you have any pilots live right now yeah for sure so we have a pilot right now in curacao it's a small caribbean island we actually started experimentation there over four years [255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=255.72s)

ago um it started back in 2018 when we received a grant from dao stack which was one of the let's call it the three big guys back in those days um you had aragon dallas tag and colony um this was kind of pre-moliked out pre a lot of the things that people may consider kind of the start of dao history now [274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=274.38s)

um we received a grant to look for the potential of decentralized governance for small island nations specifically um that research showed to our surprise of course not that over 50 percent of [[public good]] funding went away because of nepotism it kind of trickled down to the wrong pockets um and we looked at three different areas we look at the social the social [294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=294.54s)

effects the economic effects and the um ecological effects of that kind of um male governance that started a whole crazy journey of now four years to trying to build solutions for that um back in 2019 we created curadou which was i think one of the first if not the first impact down in the world um it was a group of about 50 people um all locals from the island governing [319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=319.62s)

a small treasury together and they were allocating that to microgrants to um yeah local ngos local individuals from that experimentation we realized that having a mechanism for distributing resources is incredible but we still need to attract resources which was still a problem yeah i'm sorry i didn't mean to i was gonna say like i wanted to pause and [344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=344.28s)

just camp on that point for a second a lot of people think that the biggest problem with supporting [[public good|public goods]] is uh raising the money but there's actually a whole other side of that coin when it comes to distributing the funds in a legitimate way and what you said about 50 of the funds going to nepotism or being misallocated is a huge problem and i think that's actually one of the [364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=364.68s)

big opportunities for the space is to build networks of [[collective intelligence]] to figure out how to uh uh route resources in a more legitimate way so um yeah thanks for letting me just camp on that point please foresee yeah 100 and i think that i was listening to the episode that you did about [[impact network|impact networks]] and i think what you're describing is [[collective intelligence]] a lot of the times that nepotism is not mountained they're not trying to screw people over just by sheer lack of information and lack of understanding they end up screwing people over but it's majority of the times they're not trying to screw people over it's just the the system is designed in a way that they end up doing that and i think that's really something incredible about [406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=406.68s)

the new way of organizing a new way of coordination where we're really getting more information from the edges of the network from inside of the network and we're able to make better decisions together which i think that alone is already such a big problem and something so exciting about the space that we're in that we can even dream about finding solutions for that yeah um [425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=425.58s)

so the danish experiment was i would say extremely successful um we got support from all areas of the island but then we realized that without resources we can't really do much with our fancy tool um so that opened our research into community currencies which is an innovation that already existed pre-crypto [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=447.06s)

it's essentially these local complementary currencies they could be vouchers they could be a web 2 system an sms system whatever that already exists in a couple hundred locations to increase local production and trade um so for example brixton in sardinia you have these these networks of hundreds of merchants that accept it and they are forgiven legitimacy and [468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=468.24s)

um kind of allow that area to thrive without needing outside input or leading less outside input um this was around the time as well when d5 started to emerge slowly um i was always at the forefront building doubts i co-founded alfast with felipe duarte which later became the taoist so i've been really at the forefront of dao innovation [491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=491.039s)

and it's around early 2020 when it was very clear that everybody only cared about defy um i think there was defcon 2020 um we were trying to make a case for dallas but everything that people cared about was sunny and kane and kind of what they were up to um so this was kind of trivial on the show that hey this financial stack is [509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=509.639s)

going to come maybe even before the dow stack comes um so we even tried shifting to d5 fast luckily we never did that um but what it did do was unleash kind of our tinkering around hey how can we leverage defy to um potentially solve this research problem that we have [526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=526.92s)

so then we applied for a grant from maker dao and we built together with makerdale what we called curadai which was a stable coin for the audience of curacao the not stable coin was quite easy to make because curacao just like about 24 other countries has a currency that's backed to the us dollar which means that our central bank needs to hold an x amount of us dollar in its [549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=549.06s)

reserve and then because of that we can hold a fixed exchange rate between our currency and the dollar um this used to be great in the times of oil refinery because we used to be one of the biggest all refinery countries in the world we're also number two most polluting country in the world per capita i think we should really be proud of it um not anymore though our refinery is closed now but um essentially it was quite easy to make the system because we have this fixed pack um but while doing that we also realized the downsides of this fixed pack um because and especially the past two years every time that the us prints new money our community is further deluded [585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=585.72s)

um they loaded down because we don't get any of the benefits of this new cache of this new capital but we do get let's say the punishment of needing to remain maintain an x reserve to keep our currency afloat um combining that with the um export or the export deficit that we have on the island [607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=607.5s)

um that has led to catastrophic outcomes so for example during covid we had a 50 unemployment rate on the island because there literally was no cash in circulation we are heavily dependent on tourists and those didn't come and then um essentially everything went to shambles over half of the population was relying on food aid um so this really pushed us further and [628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=628.32s)

further to go into this currency route um we did this experiment with maker dao we proved that the models itself were relatively easy to make let's say the monitor monetary tools which was already incredible right being able to create monetary tools like what here i am a little dude coming through your island like hey i'm back home ah by the way i was born there so i have some legitimacy [649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=649.2s)

on the ground but that's great you've got like the legitimacy in the web 3 community because you've been deeply integrated there and you were born there and you're kind of bridging that local community um i actually think that's a really scalable model for taking web 3 tools and creating like a local regen tool kit people have legitimacy in both [666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=666.6s)

communities are going to be the bridge between doing those things so how's everything yeah 100 and i think we can dive into that in a bit later kind of how we aim to scale this but um it's essentially this first fighter that shows so much so make sure die was i would say very successful what we saw is that adding this cultural element to it adding the colors and the feelings of of [687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=687.42s)

a location um keeping it to the unit of account that they understand increase the rate of adoption tremendously so we ran an experiment i think for three to six months we already had i think about 50 merchants a couple hundred users without having to do any marketing or any anything that the relationship direction because people understand what it is [708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=708.62s)

they see their their colors they see their value and they adopt it quite easily compared to previously we would be issuing grants and eat and it would confuse the crap out of people because we they would get a grand for a thousand guilders and then moment that they went and claimed the grand it was only 800 killers and they would get mad at us like hey are you scamming me [728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=728.579s)

um you promised me a thousand i get 800 what's going on yeah um and this was a pivoting moment actually it's 2020 because as things got worse and worse and worse we felt this urge to take ownership more and more um pre-covet we were in more like the satoshi mindset we were doing everything hidden and sneaky maybe it's hard to imagine for [748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=748.44s)

some people but i would say pre-2020 you really shouldn't have spoken about crypto too often it was a little bit scary to talk about it you were afraid it you'd get robbed or sued or killed or um anything in that direction lose your deposits on fdx we're recording during the week in which that's happening so uh we might be regressing as an industry during this bear market i don't know [769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=769.98s)

we'll see not your keys not your coins i'll repeat yeah not your keys not your coins keep it close to you that's the beauty of this technology but essentially what happened was we realized that this problem and it isn't just curious like i mentioned there's 22 more than 20 countries that have a similar system and over 75 that have an anchor or a soft anchor to another [790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=790.98s)

currency so this is a global problem that many many countries are experiencing especially developing countries um so we realize that we need to step up and take ownership of this problem we participated in the anovathon by the local government and we've ordered first time imagined the system of colectivo which means collective in the local [810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=810.72s)

language where we created this let's call it a circular economy where the community creates value tokenizes some of that value and utilizes again to fund the next wave of of development um and we won we won the an avaton and i was shocked so i asked as the government people do you understand what i'm saying because i'm saying very scary stuff and they said we don't completely understand [834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=834.959s)

it but we understand the problem and we want a solution just as bad as you do so please here's price money i think it was like 10 it was a very low amount um but they wanted us to continue and that gave me the confidence to go out um scale my team i was already working um width and four doubts around that time to build up capacity resources to third collective into reality and that [856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=856.5s)

kind of all accelerated in 2021 um we received a grant from fuse and then later on a grant from cello which is a layer 1 blockchain focused on enabling prosperity um and they gave us a grant um for us to imagine the system we came back with a white paper and prototype and they told us wow this is incredible um this is exactly what we hoped to [879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=879.72s)

achieve with cello let us know how we can help that turned into a strategic round which we have been using for the past 12 months to get us to the stage where we are today and that stages that we just went live with our mvp two weeks ago and in q1 we will have the full system ready which includes the toolkit for creating managing local community currencies a user-friendly wallet [901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=901.32s)

focused on real world users and merchants and a system to tokenize ecological assets where we use a new standard that we developed called the geo nft which we did together with astral protocol there's a whole bunch finally coming together and then once we have established that then it's on to scaling to four to eight other jurisdictions and gather as much input [922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=922.32s)

as we can to hopefully turn this into a global scalable solution that can go around the world beautiful well there's a lot there um there's two things that i really want to unpack the mechanism nerd in me is really excited to talk about geo nfts in the mechanism behind that um and basically how governance verification the geo nft and [944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=944.82s)

environmental monitoring understanding the material reality works so the mechanism nerd is is sort of half a for me but then the path b is taking these crypto tools and putting them in the hands of those who are not only non-crypto but maybe are even non-tech native and so i know choose your own adventure where should where should we dig in on first let's start [967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=967.38s)

with the mechanism near its side i think that's that's exciting to start with okay let's do it so so how does the mechanism work i feel like that's like a five word question that is gonna unlock like 15 minutes of conversation but but yeah at the mechanism at a very high level how does it work so one something that's very um foundational to collective when our [990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=990.36s)

approach is this focus on local there's focus on making it as real and tangible as possible and embedding it into the real world um and one thing that that's always frustrated us about traditional natural asset markets or carbon markets and what so is how opaque and abstract it is um it seems rather disconnected from reality more than it is connected to [1011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1011.779s)

reality um so what we're trying to do is really embed this as close as possible into reality and and make you feel even through the web that you understand the physical context of this so what we have done is we've worked together with astral protocol um they have an amazing team and they're specialists at spatial [[smart contract|smart contracts]] so those are [[smart contract|smart contracts]] that are connected to a specific geographic area or steel spatial area and we're creating the standard called geo nft that is able to store data of a specific geographic location so let's imagine a reef structure we're first going to set out the parameters of the geographic location of the refractor um let's say melody it's a hundred [1057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1057.679s)

square square meters now we're going to deploy different methods to gather information or data from this restructure um the methods we're combining right now are satellite data um iot devices underground input and weather stations and we combine those four kind of data streams into this gnfd which then [1079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1079.22s)

provides you with an almost live up-to-date um score of what we call the ecological index or the the well-being of this natural [[public good]] hmm what this allows you to do is now you don't just have a story of this but you have also a transferable store because it's an nft so what we do is based on the [1107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1107.36s)

um square meters of this position we're going to issue an x amount of tokens so let's imagine 100 square meters you can issue 100 tokens out of this nft now what you can do with these tokens are different things in our case the majority of the tokens first go in the hands of those doing the interventions which is again very different from traditional markets if you are buying [1132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1132.38s)

carbon credits the people on the ground doing the work only get this a tiny fraction of the value created there's a trillion middleman there's governments there's bureaucracy in the middle that takes the majority of the value away it's it's more like a will game than a um worker game that makes sense so what we're doing is first we're issuing these tokens to those that are [1156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1156.44s)

actually taking the action a small fraction goes to the collective network for market making purposes but then what you can do with these tokens is we've created this impact map which gives you a complete overview of all the geo nfts in existence okay and you can purchase some of these geo nfts and stake them into a specific location so the location that you that [1175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1175.58s)

you own and that's what gives you output rights for that specific location so in addition to owning your data you could potentially monetize the raw data you also get your proportional share of output rights and whether that's physical output rights but even more important it's digital output rights such as potential carbon credits [1196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1196.1s)

potential biodiversity credits or potential web 3 native methodologies let's imagine we have a data stream that's compliant with region networks methodology then we could also apply for those credits so what we're trying to do is optimize for the easiest scalable but yet most efficient data collection methods that we can then use into these geo nfts and [1218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1218.84s)

this allows those nfts because of the kind of future claims that they have and the data stored inside of it there is some market value that's going to get um appointed to them because you can almost get the speculator class that can look at the geo nft and say hey this is very likely to get carbon credits in two years because it complies with abcde or hey wow this biodiversity is going from [1241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1241.1s)

20 animals in 3 minutes to 40 animals in three minutes this is showing really good signs i am willing to put my money on this specific um area so ukrainian speculator class and then once those assets have value um these local communities can also decide to not sell them off but to use them themselves and keep them and use them as collateral for their own reserve [1262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1262.88s)

and that's kind of the end game or a part of the end game so as i understand it let me just say back to you what you said to me and tell me if i'm off or not and hopefully the audience doesn't take this as possible because i'm going from 0 to 60 on this uh it sounds like you're taking a geo nft which uh basically is connected to some sort of environmental monitoring of the underlying material [1282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1282.76s)

reality and whether it's like uh biodiversity in a certain ecosystem or the health of a coral reef or some other material reality and that nft has more value if the uh material reality is more healthy biologically and that creates a financial incentive for a capital class to collect the nfts regenerate the economy and then they they make a profit by doing that so you're basically [1310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1310.7s)

connecting the the profit motive of people to the underlying material reality am i close you're very close that's as good as it can get basically and and i think on the up another episode you did a session on superstructures and i think there it also came down a lot to values and embedding values that are regenerative by nature and that's really what we're [1332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1332.6s)

trying to do here in theory or at a start you can use our toolkit with just us dollar backing you can mint the community currency backed by us dollar or eat or bitcoin or whatever but fundamentally those assets are not as regenerative as ecological assets in your own community so starting with what works today but then slowly gravitating towards uh what we would like it to be [1356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1356.059s)

that's kind of the vision and kind of the way that we hope the skill is right um and you know of the live examples the in the pilot what specific use case a material reality is is being measured in the pilot and and where yeah so um a lot of it is in the caribbean and we actually also had a group that went to kenya for a time [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1377.84s)

um the first and most real use case that we're starting with is agroforestry it's a form of return of agriculture um that is very real in especially the caribbean and south america and especially for these small islands there's a big food deficit on our island for example you can pay up to four dollars for one apple because we don't have the supply chains for it [1401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1401.72s)

um so there's a very real need on the ground for fresh fresh fruits and vegetables um and then we combined it with the agroforestry methodology because agroforestry doesn't just create good fruits or vegetables it also increases the biodiversity it provides better water management um it's essentially a way that it's [1420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1420.559s)

regenerative by nature it really allows you to plant one foot forward so it's going to make it easier to plant the next system um we're also working already now on reef methodologies because we have a lot of reefs in our um territory as fashioned the caribbean and the third methodology is also already in its works and that's [1440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1440.0s)

mangroves and mangroves is a real um you could call it power farmer like this is like the yield farm material traditionally look for in defy because in mangrove forest can sacrific a lot of carbon way more than you would expect and in addition to that they also provide a good shelter for um growing fish and and other species so this is really a super asset that any [1463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1463.58s)

country would like to have more of it also protects you against storms and surges so it's really um those are the three let's call them asset types that we are focused on in the coming year but you would imagine as this system starts starts getting globally that other localities may want to optimize for other types of assets so maybe sorry go ahead no no go for it [1484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1484.82s)

yeah i mean i was going to say um have you found i mean i guess you just launched the pilot so maybe this isn't a fair question but have you found that um actually holding the nft actually changes the actions of the speculator class such that they're investing in cleaning up these ecosystems in the material reality and i guess i'm just [1506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1506.059s)

wondering about um you know i know that all capital is sort of competing for yield in a financial set i'm sort of like a computer software engineer that's learning finance as i am in this space but you know like if there's easier lower hanging fruit yield available elsewhere then i know that sometimes capital will skip [1524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1524.24s)

um higher hanging fruit in terms of creating yield and you know i'm just wondering if that theory of if people have a financial incentive to clean up the material reality has actually borne out yet and and how you're sort of measuring and testing that so of course i'm tempted to say yes i mean i'm incentivized to say yes but i truly believe it does [1545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1545.72s)

um so for example the island of curacao they were already investing for four years into this type of agriculture um even the minister of economic development was investing in it and it's because of this reality that at least for our locality we cannot keep investing in traditional agriculture because one bad year and we're screwed we need to look at more resilient [1566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1566.9s)

alternatives we need to lower risk we need to focus more on regeneration because otherwise it may be our end and i think that more and more people in the world is kind of impact investing i mean climate is a hot topic now i think more and more people realize that there's a really big existential risk to profit optimization alone and you can only make that bet a couple times because if you [1591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1591.08s)

keep doing it we're all screwed eventually um so i think we are seeing a change of game theory more than ever where people are real realizing things that are maybe not so important having the latest bmw who the hell carries um that may be a funny story but in the caribbean traditionally people would take loans to get very expensive cars [1609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1609.08s)

but live in very small houses because it reaches kind of low rises your social status um you'd also have a very big tv but a very small house with a broken roof but essentially what you're seeing now is that people those same people are now realizing that there are other values that are more valuable to them um less stress better food more movement [1629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1629.539s)

so if you optimize for profit like money dollar profits alone probably not going to be too interested in this because you can make more money investing in the gambling industry for example which is quite big in the caribbean but if you realize kind of um if you've come to some level of awareness then you may be more incentivized to to look at this [1650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1650.419s)

so it seems like you're kind of targeting capital that maybe has a stake in that local community not just a global pool of capital like no one from wall street's gonna gonna swing in and start regenerating local communities on the ground at least not yet and it's more about targeting local uh local capital and maybe there's an angle there where like like you said if they get [1671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1671.72s)

more social capital from having a bigger car maybe they get more social capital in their community also by regenerating their their community 100 that's actually how this whole thing started i remember like four or five years ago still super young and i and one day i was just shouting to my friends like it just needs to be easy to be good good needs to be cool [1690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1690.679s)

um yeah and i think we're slowly getting there being a regen is now cool where two years ago being a degen you were to og now we're looking at the industry and again this week again we're showing that degenerative design or degenerative values are really fun and fun in the early days but over the long run it's gonna come back at you and it's way cooler and more fun to be regen with [1711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1711.2s)

your friends and really build a better future but essentially um yes i do think that we are looking for a certain type of capital but also in addition to that because of the power of defy we're able to abstract this away to higher levels so for example um we're already looking at solutions to pull different locations together into like an index and then you can again make an index of that index and you could potentially if you're still make an index of that index so then at the very bottom the um assets that you're buying are food forests in curacao but what you're buying at the top is just an ecological index and that may be of interest to you so we're not going to sell you the locality the localities [1754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1754.64s)

indeed primarily for locals that have more value or that get more value besides us dollar returns kind of the different types of capital and what so um but by strapped by abstracting it further and further up we can potentially reach this kind of global this global level as well yeah that's that's i mean it's it's really [1775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1775.1s)

amazing i can't wait to see how the first experiment bears out and and then you can kind of start thinking about scaling this and i think that one of the things that's really neat is that it just scales geographically you've got a geo nft that has penetration in one locale and then you do an adjacent locale and you leverage the sort of momentum of the first one in order to [1794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1794.6s)

sell into the second one um and it just feels like a very modular way of going uh web scale and i guess you know that leads me to my next question which is you know say in a world say in 10 years colectivo is maximally successful what does that world look like you think fur is going to be very easy to be a region it's going to be economically and [1815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1815.539s)

socially well accepted to the point that i mean now you still have to sacrifice a lot a lot to do impact stuff you need to sacrifice a high salary which comes with security um but if we're able to make these systems that reward you again not maybe not in us dollar terms but in all the other forms of value that exist as good or better then it's it's going [1837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1837.98s)

to be quite an easy choice um but really focusing on the individual making it as easy as possible for the individual to make the right choices and then as a result of that more people will be making right choices and this kind of continues and trickles down into this network of first geographic and then a global network and what i hope that this global network would do is [1858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1858.62s)

essentially aggregate all of this into this collective network token or this collective network where essentially this currency is an abstraction of the development of hundreds of different localities and the regeneration of earth and that value then becomes let's say the value of the network which is [1880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1880.039s)

comparable to maybe proof of work or proof of stake in ethereum kind of what do we optimize for we optimize the one is kind of for machines like miners which i think is a really bad use case we already know that that's not the best way to do security and and get a value creation than with eid and i mean congratulations it on finally being deflationary i think that's a that that [1900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1900.62s)

on itself is already incredible but it's still based on some digital usage and some digital development which is still to some extent abstracted away from reality where the system that i would like to see that i hope to imagine is baked into the development of humans and nature alike and um yeah really becomes this this big [[impact network]] the world has woken up to refi and celo is here for it celo is the layer one for the [[regenerative finance]] movement it's fast planet positive and built for the real world celo has committed to producing a sustainable future from day one and has built its technology around one of the lowest carbon impact consensus mechanisms and is the world's first carbon negative evm compatible [1942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=1942.14s)

their treasury operations every crypto org needs to manage this treasury and coinshift offers a simple flexible and efficient multi-chain treasury management platform built on top of the highly secure gnosis safe with coin shift your organization can go from primitive single chain treasury management to expressive flexible and multi-chain treasury features such as [2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2002.32s)

global user management global contacts proposal management and many other features that can be shared across an entire organization allowing users to save time and reduce operational burdens and gas costs coinshift even has data tools like account reporting across the seven chains on which it operates used by industry powerhouses such as uniswap grants balancer consensus and massari [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2021.159s)

coinshift is speeding up their coordination and efficiency of the organizations that use it you have to keep up with the frontier and coin shift makes that easy so sign up at coinshift.xyz slash bankless you know it's interesting to hear you say that like it would be economically incented to be good um it's it's it's good to be good it's [2040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2040.419s)

cool to be good um the the sort of maximal successful question that we would always answer at least i would always answer when i was when i was like bitcoin was um we want to create a world where everyone has a rational economic incentive to work on the commons in their local community and so basically what you're doing is [2058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2058.599s)

creating an economic incentive that is the inverse of the tragedy of the commons it is the crypto economic incentive to maintain the comments and i heard so it felt like a reflection of of what you were saying in in my your answer sounded like it translates well to my answer and i guess you know what i'm asking what the the question that i'm sort of uh circling [2079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2079.899s)

right here is you know at what level do you think pluralism has um to play in this stack like in my vision of a civilizational scale regen crypto economic infrastructure optimism stacks on top of giveth stacks on top of get coin grant stacks on top of colectivo and you've got a pluralistic economic incentive to support the commons and that pluralism is important [2104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2104.02s)

because you have different mechanisms and if one and one fails if one goes the way of ftx um then you have others that you can implicitly rely on so not just having one structure like the government is a giant monolith that that we depend on and if your government is bad then it's bad but if you have a pluralistic civilizational scale infrastructure for [2122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2122.2s)

supporting the commons then there's anti-fragility in that so i was kind of wondering are our two theses about uh these economic incentives compatible in and if so do they stack uh to be more than the sum of their parts i think they're compatible for sure so a lot of my insights actually come from regenerative agriculture in the moment i started to understand how nature deals [2143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2143.74s)

with these things um and i think i once wanted to write so i also did a lot of work with prime down and kind of doubted out coordination and my thesis was always that by tearing this into a network of networks we become more resilient we become more anti-fragile and we can do better i think we actually had a token swap with gitcoin as well so i think our thesis kind of of the organizations also shows that we we shared that um but i think again bringing it down it this resiliency is so critical um and the [[open source]] nature of web3 makes it so easy and the composability um already right now are we integrated with different solutions on chain um but i do think that the part that is also important is the trade-offs between [2184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2184.9s)

giving people too many options which i often experience in web3 myself kind of their seven or eight or ten different landing protocols and for most people they're not sure what to pick so i do think that yes this this modularity and this kind of pluralism is extremely important but we also need to make sure that we tailor the right packages let's say to individuals where i found more [2208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2208.78s)

success in adoption with an app that has two dabs integrated in it than 500 so when i give my mom for example madame mouse qualities you can do everything in the world she does nothing because she doesn't know where to start she doesn't know what to do but when we give her the collectivo wallet where she can only store it spend it send it or purchase mobile credit or swap it on on balancer [2229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2229.119s)

then it becomes very easy because she understands there's five things she understands how they connect to each other so i do i do think that that's something that we can still get better at as an industry is really packaging those things nicely and making it easy for average people to use it because even i as like a hardcore defy person um i'm still cautious and i still don't [2251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2251.92s)

use everything and i um and especially maybe another point there's as you compound more things together you also compound risk and compound friction um say i think that bringing those things down and really packaging things nicely is is part of the dx development that we need for this to become a billion people kind of yeah [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2272.079s)

well we've come full circle back to the question that i was going to ask you which is how do we put these tools in the hands of not only non-crypto people but non-technologists and have them actually use them so you know you mentioned not giving an overabundance of choice modularity might be the right choice for the architecture of this thing to make it scale but maybe [2292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2292.3s)

creating a more compact user experience where people can do one thing and uh and do it well uh but what else is there for for bringing this stuff main mainstream like for example when you deploy these wallets to people are you teaching them about private key management how do you get around that problem there's a bunch of other problems uh with web3 i'd be curious how you're approaching this and [2312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2312.579s)

i mean there's so many answers there and i've i've experienced with people from 8 to 80 over the past year so there's such a diverse set of of users and everybody needs their own kind of touch so um as a starting point i would say people that the less pre-programmed you are the easier it is to onboard so young people easy they don't care about banks they [2335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2335.38s)

don't care about anything you show them an app that can do things and they do the things they don't care that much um so that one is rather easy i think it's just marketing it to them they'll adopt it if they like it if not they don't do it that's good um i think the parts that i am most or more excited about is um commercial individuals so let's say small business owners um onboarding them has also been relatively easy because traditionally the financial infrastructure in these places isn't great they're not used to things like cash app or like instant transfer or cross-border transfer or anything in a direction that we westerners are spoiled with i would say [2374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2374.26s)

um so giving them the utility so depending on on their desires but for the merchant is really utility this is going to give you more clients you're going to pay less fees it's going to be faster your business is going to run better they're not going to argue with you that's all they want they don't care about the tech they don't care about moses don't even care about law [2392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2392.92s)

they'll literally say oh yeah no just do it don't come if after me if they don't like it um but the thing that they really need is utility now you have another class that's let's say the culturally let's call them the woke the woke class the people that are already aware that the climate needs help that we need to shift our [2411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2411.04s)

priorities um to them it's a more of a vision cell like you need to explain to them why this app that they don't care about is going to help them accomplish this vision of a um more regenerative or better stewarded world and that's a bit more education so it's really starting with this is not bitcoin we're not using electricity [2433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2433.839s)

that's already that already takes half an hour because a lot of them are pre-programmed to say oh no crypto is bad i actually went to an impact conference um i think it was nine months ago in the netherlands it's got netherland for impact it was like all the young impact people in the netherlands and i asked the question who thinks that crypto does [2450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2450.82s)

more harm than it does good and i kid you not 95 of the people raise their hand they all thought that this was a scam that this was bad for nature and i went into arguments with them that hey these traditional financial and coordination structures take way more energy and use way more value and destroy way more things than um even if you compare to bitcoin all [2473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2473.8s)

the banks in the world with all the government like they they use so much more for coordination and for keeping your systems running um say i think with them it's more education and then for the average joe it's just making sure that the app is useful to them a lot of them so for example the festival that we had two weeks ago we had about 300 people use [2493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2493.54s)

the wallet only 10 of those were skeptical the other 290 literally were like oh i can use this to buy drinks epic i'm out let me go get some drinks because they generally don't even want to ask the harder question they don't care that much they just want utility um when it becomes harder and i need to onboard they need to do this um yeah then you may need to explain [2517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2517.18s)

better oh who's storing your money and but generally don't care that much maybe finally you spoke about private keys and that's i think one of those examples where it has gone wrong in the past again i've onboarded hundreds of people um there are two ways to do it either i make it really fun and secretive and i'm like hey you really need to write this [2537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2537.16s)

down it's super important but you can share it with your best friend half of it and the other to have to i'm kind of turning it into something that they feel is almost a little bit naughty like oh i'm i'm keeping it for myself um or on the other side making it super easy so we're working on a solution to do uh private key abstraction where you can do social recovery and what so [2557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2557.14s)

um but it is critical to either go all in and explain to them that this is kind of extremely important and they should care of it because otherwise you end up holding your crypto in an exchange and we don't want that um or making it so simple that they don't even have to understand what the hell a private key is and that they um generally to understand oh this is my [2577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2577.24s)

money only i control it and if i need help i need i cannot go to the bank need to go to my friends um which is maybe the another thing that to me as a 25 year old was very confusing that people actually had bankers that they used to talk to um i've never thought of that idea that if something happens with my money that i would call someone and that specific [2598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2598.54s)

person would help me um but that's something that we're actually having to navigate a lot in the caribbean because people still have to go physically to the bank so then they would ask me like oh if this goes wrong who do i call i'm like no you can't really call anybody you can maybe message us and we can try to look into it but yeah there's a lot of different [2616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2616.66s)

ways to approach that but again i think just having local context makes all these things so much easier because you speak the language you understand the struggles you know their backgrounds and you can much easier to kind of shift them towards a specific direction well i just feel so lucky because with gitcoin we just felt asked backwards into an audience that already understood [2640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2640.06s)

the utility of crypto private key management installed metabass could understand transactions we were serving software engineers and um you know i really just think that like i said get coin sell ass backwards into that audience and it's one of the reasons why it's been able to deliver 72 million dollars worth of funding for [[public good|public goods]] blah blah blah um but um you know when it comes to taking that kind of momentum and bringing it to a novel community it feels like there's drivers and there's barriers the drivers are the reasons why they need a solution for some problem that they have and the barriers are are like learning how to do uh private key management and uh transaction broadcasting and all that [2681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2681.16s)

kind of stuff um and i feel like a lot of people in this space focus too much on lowering the barriers and not enough on creating new drivers to get people over the barriers and you know one of the things i see with with you is that there's just such a driver for having a more regen um community or it's a regenerating local communities with colectivo that [2701](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2701.079s)

people probably natively feel that driver um but i still there's an open question in my mind about uh is the systems that we're gonna build for the mainstream are are people going to learn the new primitives of web3 like in web one we all learned about the home button and the back button and the secure lock that shows me that i'm using https or is it [2717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2717.88s)

going to be more like the blockchain mullet where it's like blockchain in the back and it's web 2 in the front um and it and it seems like it feels more likely that the blockchain mullet is gonna happen to me uh where it feels like a web 2 app or like a native app in the front but uh all of that blockchain stuff is is kind of hidden in the back and um that's scary to me because the two paradigms don't exactly fit like once you broadcast something to a blockchain it's out there forever there is no like customer service just so to contact if you lose your money and so yeah i don't know if you have anything to add here but this is kind of my traversal of trying to bring this technology to people who aren't just software [2755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2755.74s)

engineers i do have a lot of thoughts there i think generally um we're gonna see some core principles of blockchain to be widely adopted and normalized um think of transparency i think that's something that is being more and more normalized in these communities and was traditionally not normalized at all um ownership truly being the owner of [2775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2775.66s)

something is extremely powerful but also new to people um that's a concept that they will need to learn and get comfortable with um i think digital assets are or are currently already being normalized more and more people understand that they can freely send things and receive things and i think that's i think nfc's [2794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2794.5s)

actually did something really good there um there's digital governance i think more direct governance is also something that i hope people get more of um but i think besides those let's say key powers that they're gaining i don't want to bother them too much with the technicalities um they should understand what it means to them and what it allows them to do [2819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2819.64s)

um but they're probably not all gonna become as technical or being even one to become as technical as we are um as this rolls out um got it well yeah i mean i i think that it's really important to figure out how to put these hand these tools in more hands [2838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2838.3s)

so i think that the work you're doing here is pioneering um i think we only have 10 five minutes left and so i'm i'm wondering if there's anything that i didn't ask that you that you want to tell us about with respect to colectivo i think we covered most of it actually i think we went through the gnft stuff we [2858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2858.94s)

went through the community currency stuff why that's important we went through this kind of global vision of uh maybe there's it's work kind of highlighting that one more time kind of in the current community currency systems at our web too they don't have digital assets they don't have the fight tools so there's no connection between let's say brixton and sardinia [2877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2877.24s)

um there's also no ability for them to coordinate across deployment let's say because they don't have the same standards they don't have the same method by standardizing some aspects of this but still allowing for local customization what we're creating is this global network that will not only build better software together but can [2899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2899.2s)

also have digital asset pairings together so um two things are super cool there i think one is we can make markets between let's say collectivo brazil and collectivo curacao through the collective network token so you can go from curse out to knt and then from knt to brazil and this makes it a global system [2919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2919.599s)

where you can actually do good in cursor and then pay what's for something in colombia or brazil um and that's something that we've never seen before in the context of community currencies there are always hyper local but not scalable to the rest of the world and that's something that now with taxes and with um i spent some time myself at balancer [2939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2939.099s)

and kind of really getting deep into what you can do with these liquidity pools and i think that's truly incredible and then um i guess the other part of that is um like i said this bigger vision of collectivo as a global asset and how [2957](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=2957.16s)

that will play out um i think that's also really interesting i really hope that 10 years from now we'll see different types of structures at the top of queen gecko which aren't just um stable coins the layer ones i i really hope that we get to the point where the application itself is so valuable that um yeah that it can get to the top and it's valued as an application instead of kind of forcing everyone to build the the base infrastructure if i can because yeah i mean we got a few more minutes i mean the thing i just want to remark on is that i'm increasingly um i believe in [[local currency|local currencies]] and i the reason for that is is that with us dollars and bitcoins everything gets its most commoditized form uh you know bud light in like bikinis are like the race to the bottom of the brain stem that happens in in like global ad markets for example and what if we could create [[local currency|local currencies]] around values that are like this biodiversity of in health of [3022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=3022.38s)

our coral reefs or the the the fish trade in a local area um or they don't even have to be local geographically but they could be local and value systems like maybe get coins uh you know a a community built around global [[public good|public goods]] and radical is built around [[open source]] software and so um i actually think that like at first like you know when bitcoiners call every [3046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=3046.68s)

coin that's not bitcoin a coin i always knew that that was wrong because bitcoin's kind of the first coin um but i actually think that it's it's like 180 degrees wrong because what we want is a diversity of [[local currency|local currencies]] that represent their own value systems that are interoperable can be traded to us dollars if you want to move into the global system so a plurality of those [3067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=3067.319s)

[[local currency|local currencies]] i see as being a key building block here 100 and i think that's freedom right the opportunity to choose what you align with and which values you want to represent and and that brings me all the way back to this initial problem that there are over 80 countries that in order to survive need to be packed to a bigger value system that doesn't share that same symbiotic [3088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=3088.099s)

relationship with them so it's kind of a one-sided relationship where um every time i do a transaction in curacao i'm indirectly reinforcing the us hegemony because indirectly i'm reinforcing the us dollar banking system the us dollar to currency even though maybe i don't want to maybe i have different values but i can't decide i [3110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=3110.04s)

don't have another option so this player plurality of value alignments i think that cryptocurrencies have enabled i think it's potentially even the biggest innovation of all because now you can finally decide what you really care about and spend your energy and resources there um and gain more of that i think that's incredible and why i really hope that [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWeHepqmNeU&t=3128.22s)
