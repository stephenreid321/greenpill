foreign music ation how you doing today on the pod we got apologies from kyc dao kyc dao is a multi-chain platform for issuing on-chain kyc verifications they basically allow any web 3 project or any doubt to become compliant with various regulations so basically the idea is to build a money lego for regulatory compliance and what that does is that it allows more people to come in to defy and to build on public chain ethereum so we talk a little bit about the various philosophies of cypherpunk being privacy focused and on uh sort of like defy as it exists now and we talked about what would have to be true to bring more institutions into the space and the arbitrage between those values we talked about decentralized identity uh foundation in this space and some of the controversies that have happened in that space nfts versus versus verifiable credentials dows and what they're good for in the identity space [[sybil resistance]] obviously you got to talk about [[sybil resistance]] since uh that's been a big focus over at gitcoin and just our various perspectives on digital identity so if you like me are down the rabbit hole of digital identity and you believe that digital identity can be the light in the dark forest that helps us see our counterparties and interact with them in a positive some way that maximizes repeat interactions with decentralized reputation then i think that this is a good episode for you if you're not then hang on for season three and i'm really excited about what uh our conversation with my conversations with biology today so i think that you're gonna enjoy it as well and without further ado i'll give you bologies from kyc dell coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses who need to manage their treasury operations every crypto org needs to manage their treasury and coinshift offers a simple flexible and efficient multi-chain treasury management platform built on top of the extremely secure gnosis safe with coin shift your organization can go from primitive single chain treasuries to expressive flexible multi-change features such as global user management global contracts proposal management and many other features that can be chaired across an entire organization coin shift layers on powerful treasury management tools on top of the proven security of nosa save allowing users to save time and reduce operational burdens and gas costs coinshift even has data tools like account reporting across the seven chains on which it operates used by industry powerhouses such as uniswap grants balancer consensus and mazari coin shift is speeding up the coordination and efficiency of the organizations that use it in d5 you have to keep up with the frontier and coin shift makes that easy so sign up at coinshift.xyz slash bankless the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet opera lets you access d5 apps quickly and easily the opera wallet has buy sell and swap features and of course lets you view your beautiful nfts but the browser still lets you use any crypto wallet extension you prefer giving you the choice and flexibility for the web 3 world opera lets you view and manage all of your assets across all the blockchains all at once and offer seamless

opera is truly building the battle station for the crypto world check out opera both on mobile with android and ios apps and on desktop too alrighty what's up how you doing yeah thanks a lot thanks for having me yeah pretty excited to chat today so tell me about kyc dell yeah um kyco is a project that focuses on like battery compliance so it might be slightly different than your usual guest uh but super happy to share more about it um i mean basically uh kyc though wants to solve the problem that's kind of like more and more prevalent in the all battery spaces rather like how we can use verifications in a way that either we don't need to redo verification but actually compliance stays how we can help companies or projects or web free protocols to become compliant whether because they decide to or they do services that require them to do um regulations are kind of coming um it's not really a if it's a one and and kind of building some infrastructure around it that can actually serve prep tree in a sort of blockchain any way is something that like kind of like grinding or driving the whole project forward right so uh i'm on your website which is kyc dow dot xyz right now and it says a multi-chain platform for issuing reusable on-chain kyc verifications so who's the ideal customer for this is it just like exchanges who want to make sure that their counterparty is not on some blacklist or you know what's the what's the ideal customer that the the kyc dial would integrate with so basically um i would say like exchanges will be like a last category um as they already have a compliance process in place um replacing that through compliance processes is extremely complex let's call them web 2 for now um ideal customers are really like battery projects so think of like grant programs that give out grant grant money on like a legal basis or uh platforms like dial frameworks that want to like become like legal dows those that want to create like a legal wrapper and they kind of like in a jurisdiction where they have to verify all their users because maybe like everyone decides on their treasury um it can be used for like potentially uh for nft platform for certain use cases when when an nft is more consider the security in some cases more than a utility uh we have conversations with with a couple of d5 protocols but those are like very distant um we had conversations with on an offram solution so that kind of like the concept of you know you bring your own verification to the on-ramp and then they can accept it you don't need to do another kyc at the time of like on-ramping money um so it's pretty broad uh the goal is not to replace the goal is to have bad trip projects um be able to meet compliance requirements got it okay yeah i mean i think that there's multiple different types of identity and i think you're probably the first one that i've talked to that is focused on on compliance i i you know i i'd be curious before we dive in on that specific use case to zoom out a little bit first though so you know what's your experience in the digital editing identity space i think you worked at diff for a little while can you tell us about that and what led you to kyc dell yeah sure um so basically there is even one more before so i got into the whole space of web3 at large uh with my previous project uh that was called takanu uh it was a banking solution for refugees and it was focusing on banking but it became extremely very quickly clear that identity plays an extra a very big role on understanding people and enabling them to access finance crypto at that time was playing a role and then decentralized identity or blockchain identity at the time as we were calling it became very clear it would be ideal for people crossing borders uh who doesn't really have a government or their government is uh is the one that they are fleeing from so kind of like a very ideal network that's like not owned by anyone governments got shut it down it would make sense um of course since then we learned a lot about like uh blockchain identity then like the term self-certain identity was coined and and based and following that project i was already drawn very close to like identity digital identity and and the battery space so i had the opportunity to join the decentralized identity foundation and really help it to scale to what it is now this recognized organization uh during my time i was basically the only full-time paid employee of the foundation so wore a lot of hats from running operations and legal side of of the foundation as well as basically contributing into almost every single work item that was developed during that time i was i was at the foundation um so had a chance really to talk uh with pretty much every member of thief that's about like 300 companies and kind of like help them to onboard or or kind of guide them through any of the questions that they have or find the right person once they're done um as sometimes it was like way too technical or way too deeper than i could have answered so kind like i do have like a pretty good understanding of of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials and and that knowledge kind of like what i've been using to starting the concepts the early concept of kyc though that we have been like establishing and growing since the inception right so i mean i i'm i'm curious uh exactly how kyc dial works so i see on the website kyc nfts are non-transferable and unlock novel use cases in web3 including trusted communities fair voting dial governance defy crypto native on and off ramps uh artist team or founder verification and pseudonymous fundraising and investment so uh it seems like i go through some amount of kyc and then i get a non-transferable nft yeah i mean the tax that's i would say the technical uh situations it's funny enough like we started working with non-transferable nfts before they were called soul bands um naturally now we are like internally also started calling them solvent because that got a pretty good pretty big boost from vitalik um but in general like we really use these nfts to represent the legally established trust so what's important in the framework that we really approached the whole question from a compliance like a legal regulatory perspective and we are assigning technology um that kind of meets the requirements and and the widest area of um solutions that our target audience kind of have been expressing so we in a sense take liability for the verifications and so this is not like a one-off verification proved unchained that at that day you had a government id and you were able to take a selfie but it's really like how banks take how banks like issue a credit card to your more like a debit card to you that you can use online towards online merchants the online merchant doesn't actually know who you are that's hidden by stripe it's kind of the same concept is that it's just there is no stripe of course because there is the blockchain for for the payment trail and it's hidden who you are because the nft doesn't contain any information about the user itself it really contains a valid or invalid status it's just the difference is that the valid status has behind it a whole compliance mechanism that continuously ensures that like that user is not on a sanction list in the real world not an essential not not interacted according to certain standards with on-chain sanctioned addresses and kind of i can be trusted uh by the by the project that it or the other person they are interacting with so really like think really simply like not recreating but that's the closest of the debit card framework um uh just really designed for that tree word so i want to drill in on one point that i know that listeners care about and that'll be privacy so when i upload my id it's got a bunch of different information that i probably don't want to be have put out there publicly and i know that a lot of blockchain based systems have a a bias towards transparency and globally readable and accessible data um i'm assuming you're not doing that with kyc data so what kind of privacy predictions do i have as a user when i upload my credentials to the system so we we store the data i think like we have to be very transparent about that because compliance is not not really about like a verification itself it's also the continuous monitoring uh for continuous monitoring there has to be access to data um as well as like we will be will be required to provide data in case if there is a software or there is like a full financial transaction like in the worst case like the travel rule requirements extend to crypto as well then technically the users who verified through our framework will be able to meet those requirements because we can support uh interacting we shall i get into what's a travel rule just for example yeah so travel rule very simply i'm also not a lawyer is a is a growing uh requirement framework um we read about a couple of regulators where every trend like international transactions that required to know the issuer of the account required to disclose the name and some personal information with the receiver institution so my bank has to tell kevin's bank who i am before the transactions happen but also cabins don't have to do the same before the transaction happened to my bank uh and now there's a conversation um kind of unfortunately in the eu that it might extend to crypto transactions as well meaning a crypto transaction between two words would be considered an international transaction that might need to meet travel requirements um technically speaking we can serve this use case as we are able to fulfill the requirements that it has uh in terms of like privacy so as i said like um i'm i'm i'm very conscious of privacy so um working with refugees and kind of like figuring out how we can make technologies that works for them is a lot more harder than it sounds because it's not just about what's their privacy they think or like they feel is bad but also like their data is extremely uh sensitive like almost a little bit more than every citizen because there are governments that are chasing there can be a government that's like chasing them so really protecting the data and kind of like working around that and making services is a very complex task um here what we are doing is using the blockchain as kind of the signaling api issuing a non-transferable nft it could be just a sign message that would not be can't be transferred it's just the nfd has a couple of more meaning can get into a bit later but it has no personal information and that's like super important it's really signals trust um and and we store the data we have we are like we have a pretty context like um compliance data service um that we are setting up that means like gdp or ccpa slc2 and kind of like the general requirements but as we are not running like a service that really wants to mine data we also are able to like encrypt on a continuous basis a large part we can unencrypt it um and in case if it would be for for like information transfer as of any travel rule or you are facing an on-rem that's required to have the the your information because they are a regulated entity it only can be happen if there is a signed consent message from the user so kind of like there is that opportunity i wouldn't say it's already done we are focusing on making sure that it's usable the the core use cases um and really like we will be very transparent about like how these things are happening uh going forward okay got it so if i'm a technologist that wants to learn more where do i where do i check out how this whole system works so soon we're gonna release our documentation um technically the service is live a couple of projects are integrating well we who win we covered all of these questions uh in their public documentation we'll go live uh in a couple of weeks maybe a month and it it will cover everything uh and if there are any questions we are very happy to answer we have a discord and and we are there to answer questions what would you say to someone who's on the more safer punk part of the spectrum and would say kyc is censorship you're getting access uh we should all be building private systems that are outside of the existing systems and compliance is a waste of time you know like it feels like i i know a lot of people in the space that have this sort of perspective on on compliance and you know i'm curious what what your response to that criticism that category of criticism would be i also know a lot of people on on that end um i think as our focus is also not to convince anyone to build the other way um it's more about the requirements that are extending to companies that are run as companies and not just a protocol that will that are more and more need to meet requirements whether they decide to uh build solutions that are more privacy preserving that's amazing but there will be companies that decide to meet requirements and they will need to link and whether they use something back to um or something that's natively built for web3 that's kind of like we are building something natively for web3 um i'm a european citizen our governments are not extremely terrible um in terms of like servicing us but for be able to service us they need a little bit of understanding of who we are um of course like the financial oversight in all these countries are a little bit ridiculous to a degree but but i do understand that like they do need to also protect certain industries of course it usually falls on the other side of the what are those industries and how much protection they need um i think it's a super complex question uh i'm i'm a bit realistic that like the regulations will come like we can we can sit and wait that say that they are not coming um we are building technologies already like there are a number of technologies that can serve a lot of use cases um five years ago we all of us were like yay like uh we are replacing the banks and it's going to be a new industry and and now the banks also want to use these technologies but they bring their own requirements because they run businesses that are regulated they can't touch non-compliant services even if they're like very brave very new companies can do that because they are they don't have an existing business model and kind of like we need to create the blurring between web through and battery and i see that like using the five primitives but bringing in or meeting certain compliance requirements that f3 brings in create this like in between layer between web 2 and battery that can really enable certain growth of the whole industry but it's clear that the d5 primitives are like battery primitives that has been developed in the couple of past years are really the one that like drives this like adoption of of crypto and battery technology got it yeah so i mean it seems like a lot of this stuff is non-negotiable if you're a bank or a company that's entering the space particularly if you're in a heavily regulated jurisdiction and you're trying to build bridges for those people is i guess how i would sum that up but i don't know if that's a fair a fair summary yeah i think like um being able to cross between better and that tree is still a really unsolved problem it's primarily done by very regulated or semi-regulated entities um but no one else can really do that to open that up we need to meet those requirements that pretty much those existing players already meet like or or we can just say that like we build our own economy and we don't care about the real economy but that has been the same for a long time and and it really didn't like like crypto payments is still something that like very few services except crypto and and now we have even more script unity because like sec is just like lashing out on on projects and and [[smart contract|smart contracts]] uh but we also can understand or say that like regulators actually understand what blockchain is so so the saying that regulators have no idea what's happening it's kind of like it's an old one now because they actually very much understand what's happening um and we still have to educate them to the degree and really start to be a lot more precise about what they know because they know a lot so if we can get like eye to eye with them and and work and not seeing like every single regulator will be willing to do that but like like enabling them to understand even further nuances than just like black and white um the financial system is also not working just black and white there is a lot of nuances there um i'm curious you know i have in my notes uh uh uh something that when i when i did research on you all uh nfts versus verifiable credentials which i know has been a hot topic i mean that was like four controversies ago that was before tornado cash that was before um soulbound tokens basically the criticism of them was that they were dystopian because there was no consent associated with them and verifiable credentials and off chain i know evan mcmullen has been really hot on this subject of verifiable credentials versus nfts curious what what your take is on that and and where you land on on that debate yeah um i think so let's starting from macro um let's be transparent we are developing a solvento camp based solution but we're also developing a very specific solution that is basically in a way um extremely beneficial to be public at all times and not just in certain cases um i do think that like this closing or creating the solventoken airdropping mechanism because you're a member of a dao or because you're a member of the marketing team or because you did this small project is something that is extremely eroding privacy uh at a at a degree that it cannot be like replaced of course you can replace your wallet but really enough resources your previous one then your new wallet can be connected like that's that kindness has been done uh we know it's all public at the end so you know the reputation-based solutions trust me they are like looking at these and if you move money from one bullet or to another one that has all these like membership tokens they will be able to connect them as well since you move like 99 of the assets from walmart to another they are connected so i'm like really not a big fan of using svts without like thinking so there's another block that we put out during that during that time which kind of like sets out the requirements that we went through thinking about like what exactly our sbt tokens should look like what it should be like like all the considerations um happy to also send you the link and maybe you can put in the show notes um but in general like i think a lot of use cases are not completely ideal um what i would like to see is is is the constant part well of course it's super important but if you want to have it public then have it public but if you don't want to have reported then give me a json give me a verified organization give me something that i can be using whatever ways whether it's accepted by other parties or not that might be my problem but like don't force me to have it on chain i want to have other ways because you know if you make a decision you want to have a public like people have been using venmo for transactions like um it's a decision in a way maybe a bit education could be put around but like at least there was a decision um and and in terms of like vcs or not we see so you know as i said like we are building for that tree vcs are not blockchain native um performance they are off-chain data so what we are building is basically the ability to create protocols that are compliant so that a [[smart contract]] can understand and this is as they currently are are living not on a blockchain so like our focus is to bridge that we can issue verifiable credentials as well so we are talking with a couple of the wallet providers or like identity wallet providers um because it's for us it's just another sign message but the core product is really built around like battery servicing um plus nfts has a have an image and it creates this relatively dry service that we are providing like like identity verification and it can offer like a personalization so you know like on twitter you have the blue check mark and you are verified but you don't own it it can be taken away here technically you own it you can even like personalize um and and that kind of creates like a a little bit better feeling i would say uh on on reviews uh and feedback we have received so that's a big thing um nfts bring a lot of new new customers into the space it makes things a bit more transparent and understandable so a vc is pretty hard to grasp for someone who is not into identity an nft that represents that you have a valid verification is is something that like pretty much everyone understands yeah i wonder if these things are really apples to apples though because it seems to me like you know nfts are something that i want to collect i know how to show that off in my wallet i hang out on open c but you know they're also very financialized because the user knows about them whenever i use an app that has vcs on it like bitcoin passport for example the vc is just the data storage in the back end like expecting the user to know about a vc is like expecting them to know about the postgres database that runs your your system so they feel a little bit apples apples to oranges to to me but i'm curious to see how things evolve i mean nfts obviously have a huge head start just given how many wallets and sites support erc 721s but i'll be curious to see what the [[schelling point]] in the in the community is oh no like don't get me wrong like definitely like you don't have to understand it's more like it's a lot easier to explain what happens yeah and so i've worked for dave and i explained what i did and that we see about like a thousand times during that time um and and kind of the conversation is still about keep explaining what a vcm did because people try to understand the whole framework um and that that's something that like is a very big pain point of course we can hide them and like just say that like you get a signature that proves that you're verified and that's sufficient but like um in blockchain i think there is like a lot more transparency on technology pieces than than normally in web 2 because everyone is have a basic understanding how the technology that underpins all that we are talking about works so there is a lot more curiosity than in general audiences globally on any service immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable

industry experts so why dao like why why did you all decide to make a dao doesn't that just make things harder uh speaking from experience why kyc dao instead of like kyc money lego uh what is the dow add to the equation yeah um it's so think of it in a way that all the compliance services that we are offering is is basically done by a for-profit company that sits um like slightly under uh the dial the dao is really the concept of of offering battery services at the larger scale because of course like what we are building is very powerful for for wallet holders but of course like there is a lot of other companies already have this kind of verification data and some of them have an extremely good compliance processes in place we see the future where like we are our for-profit is only like one of the issuers of these verifications and the dow actually is a governance place there this decision whether another issuer can participate in the framework is made um so it's not whether you have some compliance service and then you created your own schema framework that you can just like hey let's start using this because we are like all eye to eye because how can a project know whether like a u.s compliance or like us kyc versus a bahama kyc versus um a german kyc really aligns to meet all the requirements if you are serious about compliance that's that's kind of be there so we set up kyc dao which is essentially like a little bit like that three projects come together that care about compliance that accept the kycnfds that we are issuing and they can make decisions whether they trust another issuer to come on board whether that issuer meets the requirements set by that i was like a minimum layer which kind of like establishes like a number of trusted parties but for for the nft the nft doesn't disclose whether it's coming from partier or party b so really for the project at the end it's still this like extremely simple service if this nft is minted it makes this wallet compliant that is trying to access my service so i can provide them those additional framework or that new tooling that is designed for them um and really like that's where we see the dao but we don't really think that this should be like monetized in the governance token we think of it as really like compliance decision made people who understand compliance to whether welcome new new issuers whether to align with new privacy places introduced in certain regions of the world and really to be able to serve like a global compliance needs because what we have like kind of discovered or realized i would say is that fintech companies that are operating their services are really starting in one geolocation you start in the uk you meet your uk financial regulators you can set up your compliance according to that you extend to france you made the french regulation you extend to the us you meet the u.s regulation state by state when you're a d5 projector you're operating a battery service you're probably going to have users from every single country that supports blockchain or that doesn't ban blockchain now meeting those requirements for unless you're an extremely big project is super critically complex and so kind of like making the ability that like the users bring their own compliance but that's created by a collaboration of uh global compliance officers is something that we see as like a very efficient way forward right okay yeah i was getting some flashbacks as you were speaking just to our experiences with launching a dow and some of the trade-offs there uh it's a longer path than i think people realize when they when they set it up it's it's a step-by-step um like the the focus is first providing the service that can be accepted and that works for that as we are the only sure we don't need the doubt to make that decision and then kind of as things evolve and we see like there is actually a need we prove everything um then we can start seeing like how exactly to operate this dial probably like bare bones at the beginning and more complex as it grows um it's something that like you know it has been solved without tokens many times these are called like associations um where projects come together and agree on things i run a standardization organization or like i was leading operations there for dave i see how hard is it to actually get multiple companies with very different interests to align on something so i have some experience on on kind of figuring this out but i also see the value that it creates that it's not um one company that says left or right you're a competitor you can't issue i really want to avoid that naturally there has to be like some streamlining but like the ideal is that we can we can bring together parties and and create a framework that's like really works for battery um i'm curious you know i just have to ask this question because as listeners know i i founded get coin and uh while i'm no longer involved in get coin i've been following the work they've been doing from the outside and they just launched bitcoin passport which can basically hoover up a bunch of different credentials on chain or off chain um and get coin passport is designed to solve [[sybil resistance]] because get coin has a big [[sybil resistance]] problem with [[gitcoin grants]] being reliant on [[quadratic funding]] and so like i said you know this is all just a preamble to my question which is does kyc dial and kyc do anything from a [[sybil resistance]] perspective do you think do you think it creates a utility for that yes i mean probably this is like the from from a pure severe resistance perspective like one of the more most heavy-handed um approach if you really only want to solve severe resistance but it also offers the ability that it's very hard to trick um because it has been like established the process is used by hundreds of millions of times like verification identity verification processes they are pretty fine-tuned um it creates a very strong [[sybil resistance]] mechanism whether if you really just want to solve um would go with it it's really the question if it's if your use case is only severe resistance or it's cb resistance and you want to have in your illegal wrapper because then this also offers both at the same time because then you'd know that no sanctioned person is at a um touching your treasury so you kind of actually comply and but you don't actually know who are your users so that's like one thing that like a lot of projects have been pretty excited about that through this framework and projects actually don't know who are their users they don't need to deal with personal information but they know to an extremely high degree that the user can be trusted and is and can be interacted with yeah i mean i think that makes sense um i think that there are probably music non-kyc ways of doing [[sybil resistance]] at least that's what i've i've learned over the last few episodes of greenpill and doing research in this space and i'm wondering to see if a more like skeuomorphic uh thing like like kyc dao works or if like a more bright id web of trust type of model is what captures the imagination of [[sybil resistance]] in the space and get coins kind of prepared for anyone to be the winner of [[sybil resistance]] because it can hoover up all these creds so uh we'll be curious to see if the dow integrates kyc dial in the in the future if the by if the get coin dial integrates kysito in the future i mean so you know bitcoin dial also gives out grants and as far as i know it's a u.s entity um so it's not we like like super resistance is not it's like a use case that covers because we do identity verification i wouldn't say that like we would be like a competitor uh for bright id or or any of the other like or zorro um in terms of like competing for severe resistance um i do agree that that type is needed um they are a lot less stringent on on data and so for sure i think that's awesome it's more about whether you have to meet some requirements then our tool also offers that by nature so you might don't end up implementing two because you need to meet a higher requirement than just severe resistance kind of like this is how i'm looking at it um yeah cool cool uh so bitcoin it's been a lot of work to get there but actually uh transferred all of the assets get coin holdings which is the company i'm a part of transferred all of the assets to a a non-profit foundation which is not based in the us called the get coin foundation and so there's been a lot of restructuring because we built the product wrong instead of the entity wrong at the start not realizing that the whole thing was going to become a dow but uh it i has no bearing on the point that you that you made right there i just wanted to while we're on the record here that say that the good coin is not in a us entity anymore yeah okay cool thanks thanks well i i think that's all the questions that i really had prepared i guess is there anything that i didn't ask that you want to say um i mean of course like you know when can you if you are interested um when can you learn more about kyc though so documentation is coming um if you head to our website um you can learn more you can join our discord discord.gov.xizat we are there to answer questions we have quite a number of projects that are already interested kind of around the use cases that are described on the website we will be a lot more transparent about these it's just we need to do a couple of fine tuning of the product um as it's not just have to work it has to be legally solid as well and that is a pretty big lift um but we are getting there super exciting and we are here to talk and of course if you have questions and why compliance i'm very happy to get into that with everyone i don't have anything um i super appreciate and it's been a pleasure to listen to the whole podcast like uh it's a good good experience to see like everyone's opinion in a right pretty concise format that like everyone talks a little bit about the same thing like same things but different things about but around the same topic i think it's super powerful because it gives a lot of people the ability to compare different approaches and really have a deeper understanding of like um what are what are what are was it what is identity because that's probably like the most complex question we we can talk about for years from today but also like these pieces of identity of severe resistance of verification of compliance um how it's stored yeah i think it gives a lot of people a lot better understanding so i super appreciate that totally yeah i mean part of the idea is that i just believe the identity is one of the key things for having a more regenerative crypto economic future and the reason for that is that you can see your counterparty and therefore you can have more positive some games repeat interactions and you can build trust over time and and it's so it's just kind of like illuminating the identity space and hopefully that enables more builders and more talent and more capital to flow into regen projects so that's why we've been doing it and what's nice is that everyone has a slightly different vantage point on on this space so trying to be very liberal in in daylighting a lot of people who are taking this problem seriously even if they have different values than each other and um and yeah i mean i hope i hope that in two years or three years when digital identity stuff is really prominent that uh that that we've built a more regenerative web three so that that's sort of the vision but you know i'm curious to play it forward for let's call it 3 to five years for you you know what do you think what do you think web3 looks like in three to five years and how does identity play a part i think well no like let's let's say i i hope or that what we are building towards is start hiding that tree um and and be able to make services that benefit from that trust and transparency that that tree brings but it just works for a number of use cases and not just crypto specific d5 uh staking but like really it really starts to get hidden away so maybe you know the whole concept of nfd services really can be hidden because it's already covered by two other layers of services that just really use this as a fundamental layer and it's not the thing what we are building it's three more level three four layer up i hope we don't do a lot more l1 chains because we already have quite a few um so the the multi-chain word happened uh let's hope it's not ultra multi-chain music and and really like i just had this conversation with someone who is not in crypto that we should just i i believe that we're gonna get to a point where you don't know you are using crypto like it just happened it offered you a service that created super trust whether it's financial or not i think it's debatable and if this brought in a category of concepts that really opened the space from my developers to really understand just numbers to like people who like building communities in a very very different way i think we can see we hopefully we will see a lot more of these kind of like blooming of a concept that becomes like a rich ecosystem um and i do believe that like we will have mechanisms to better deal with scams that's something that really tarnishing the the reputation of that tree to a degree that some people are like very afraid but if it's hidden we can actually probably even get them on board because they just started using a service you know like the whole run to earn staten and and sweatcoin and those things do they really use crypto yes but they are actually incentivizing people to do sports which is a super interesting thing and it seems to be working by the numbers yeah that's interesting what are the numbers there how much does sweatcoin have adoption i mean it's i i'm gonna started in like 2014 and they have like 75 million users oh wow i'm way off the main path of asking you about identity in kyc but i was just curious default not it's that's so so you know like and these are the crazy things when like and also like nike did like 190 million like uh income or revenue on nft sales like probably 10 10 people 15 people worked in it and generated more money than a lot of their departments you should get out get out of the shoe business and get into the nft business if they're gonna exactly like let's just let's just keep selling these nice little uh shoes for apes and then um anyway sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you go ahead no like so like you know we are already seeing these things happening um like digital received as nfds that can be like you know engaged community it's a lot less about pfv 10 000 this like crazy close community of like almost like gentleman clubs and a lot more like if you brought the shoe you got this nft you have access to a discord if you are active you might get additional benefits it's a little bit marketing but like kind of turning around and maybe actually creating a community outside shared interest because you're willing to engage and not just call the nfdm never cared about to claim it or something um you know co-ops and and ticketmaster i think just announced recently that like they're gonna be doing like one chain ticketing with one of the blockchains um to some degree of course but like these things are happening and these things are like adoption to to like a very interesting angle um solanape is having conversations with like pos terminals like you know like like it is slowly happening um the question is are we going to see the breakthrough when it just you know you just got a ticket but you can put it into a wallet and you can really own it and you can go to a secondary market where there is like a transparent marketplace um you know like those these are small things of course but like they really create the value at the end and we are getting there that is like big projects that we'll bring on not 10 000 more new year users but like in the hundreds of millions potentially that just don't really understand that um there is crypto of course there is a wallet key management question that's going to be huge i think there is there is a lot of interesting projects working on on on hiding keys or creating these library centralized uh key management frameworks that also gonna help a lot when security is there but the key is really hidden from the user so the monotonic like storage is like not really needed because i just onboarded a bunch of people to metamask and trust me like that's one of the most painful paintings like but you said i shouldn't store this key in a in a text format or i shouldn't write it down but i should remember these words how do i do that um it's it's a lot harder to get them past that phase than getting them to a d5 transaction um i saw a couple of followers that does it amazingly um kind of shout out to phantom i think they have like one of the best onboarding flows where you only need to store private key when you're wallet interacted with a transaction because before that it didn't have like value on it um but you had a whole lot number immediately when you opened the wallet and it's like from a user perspective who is like brand new to crypto is is so much better because you have then later an incentive to secure well your wallet not a barrier to enter to see your wallet and you know like these small things like ux we probably all agreed at like crypto ux is problematic at best but it's getting a lot better and some of it is ux design and some of it is new technology innovation that has been happening um besides of course the the numerous scams so kind of like it's good to see that a big chunk of crypto is working on something that creates value and not just extracts value yeah hell yeah that'd be a good place to end yeah alrighty well thanks so much for for joining the pod thanks a lot it was amazing music
