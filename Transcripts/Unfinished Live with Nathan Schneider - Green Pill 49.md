foreign music hi everyone how's it going i'm kevin walkie the founder of getcoin and the host of the greenpill podcast which is all about how crypto can regenerate the world and it is my pleasure today to be hosting this live podcast conversation with nathan schneider who is a professor of media studies at cu boulder and my neighbor in colorado what's up nathan [28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=28.439s)

how you doing it's good to see you good to travel a few thousand miles to be together yeah yeah totally uh well this is cooperation across distance maybe so um yeah i mean i guess uh i would describe you as a professor of media studies at cu but i'm curious how you would describe yourself yeah i'm i'm that i'm a former journalist back when i lived in new york here i was a reporter [53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=53.52s)

covering social movements as well as the early development of ethereum and uh and you know i run a master's program at cu boulder i i have a lab called the media enterprise design lab focusing on experimenting with new approaches to democratic ownership and governance with new media right yeah and uh you run the the podcast looks like new which asks old [82](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=82.08s)

questions about new technology and i think you had me as a guest a year and a half ago i sure did the tables have been turned and i'm also proud that that's not only a podcast but also a local radio show okay so people get subjected to it during rush hour in the front range of colorado yeah the radio that's that thing on fm is that right it's on fm 88.5 well we're sort of teasing it [105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=105.42s)

right now but i think that uh we wanted to sort of expand out your asking old question questions about new technology and uh sort of do the same thing about dows and web3 and put them into a frame of the larger history of social movements technologies and and co-organizing before dallas happened and so i know that you've done a lot of work preceding web3 on co-ops and exit to [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=133.52s)

community and you know i'd be curious if we could kind of pull that thread and you can tell us what you're interested in there yeah to me this question of of web3 is a kind of opportunity that we've had all along it's it's part of a much longer story about how we own and govern the economy it's something that goes back you know you can tell the story going back all of human history you [161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=161.22s)

could also start for instance at the rise of the corporation at the same time that modern corporations were being developed an another model an alternative to investor ownership was also being developed called the cooperative business model a form of business that is owned and governed by the participants and uh and and these have been parallel though one has gotten accumulated a lot more power than the other even though cooperatives have been actually a really really important part of the development of the modern world often kind of behind the scenes so when i uh uh as i've been following the rise of of um crypto i've been i've been also working with people trying to bring the [209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=209.76s)

cooperative movement into the into the tech economy into the into the online world um and uh seeing the kind of parallels there the thing that got me first really interested in in the crypto world i was doing my book tour for a book on occupy wall street uh uh in uh in early 2014 and i had to stop in san francisco and a friend there said you've got her you [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=236.04s)

gotta look at this thing that just came out and it was the ethereum white paper now by that time i'd heard about bitcoin and things like that that was kind of floating around occupy wall street as well actually um but ethereum struck me as something different because here i'd seen all this this energy and and craving among young people all over the world from egypt to [259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=259.919s)

you know here in new york uh to experiment with new forms of democracy and self-organizing uh and um and and then those encampments of those 2011 protests have been cleared and in that ethereum white paper it started me thinking is this a place where that experimentation can go forward can continue in online space is this a place too where this cooperative movement this [286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=286.62s)

this urge to uh share ownership and governance to distribute value equally to make sure that the people involved have a voice in what they're doing can continue in online space in a way it hasn't really been able to so far so it's just seemed to me like an incredibly important site of struggle my intro interest in cryptos not because i think it by itself will save the world [312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=312.419s)

or solve any of these problems but i think it presents a really incredible opportunity for what we might be able to do for how this this ongoing story of of a struggle between you know the consolidated power of wealth and the um and democratic ownership and governance can continue in a new way yeah you know as you're speaking i i i thought a little bit about um you know [339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=339.539s)

there's this parable of the blind man and the elephant and uh how one blind man will feel an elephant's tusk and say oh this is a pointy sphere and one will will grab its leg and say this is a tree trunk and in some versions of the stories they come to blows because they can't agree about what the whole elephant is and and so you know i want to use that sort of parable as a [364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=364.5s)

launching pad and and say that like when some people see web3 and crypto they see ponzi schemes that grow and collapse and they see monkey jpegs and that to me feels like a different part of the elephant if it even is the same animal as changing how we organize together and using co-ops and bringing them online and these lofty goals of redesigning how we do the economy [390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=390.36s)

together like are the monkey jpegs and what you're talking about the same elephant i i asked myself that all the time i mean i see it like when old reporter friends like from you know from from uh you know that part of my life uh you know do a story on on what's going on in crypto and i realize oh you're seeing like a completely different side of this elephant than what i happen to [412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=412.919s)

have been focused on and um and you know for instance going to the big like consensus conference in in um in austin you know big kind of crypto fairy kind of speculator heavy thing and i realized oh i have i've been choosing the spaces and the people very carefully in that mix and and and it's something i want to service i mean i've been lucky to you know be in colorado where where [438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=438.6s)

you are where lots of the the kind of energy that you bring into this um space is is centered we're working on co-op dows in colorado where where you know for instance our conference east denver is incorporated as a colorado cooperative so we're really mixing these traditions there but if you look at the you know the crypto world much more broadly and and especially what gets [463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=463.319s)

picked up in the news and what the public narrative for most people is it's such a different side of it and that was one reason for instance that i got uh excited you know for years this is kind of lurking in the back of my mind about assembling the the writings of vitalik butter and into a book which is is coming out this month called proof of stake he's the founder of ethereum and [488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=488.16s)

um and and has been a kind of important thought leader and and conversation partner for many people in this community thinking about the kind of house not focused on you know price go up price go down not focused on how to maximize your returns on random digital assets but instead thinking about those social questions about how do we organize a society not based on the [516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=516.12s)

threat of violence and coercion um and uh and and i want to invite more people into that conversation rather than the stuff that tends to be in the headlines right well yeah i mean i think that taking vitalik's ratings and making them into a book is a great way of sort of creating that cross cross pollination so the book comes out in the next month or so and it's called proof of stake [541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=541.62s)

where can people get it well they can get it on your old website at proof ofstake.getcoin.co which is uh you know where you can see all the different bookstores or whatever you can get it order it from your local bookstore that's an option too we also have a kind of nft experiment going as well where you can get a signed digital copy of the book on that site now actually you can get it with proof of stake with the new underlying system that ethereum is running on that's much closer to to carbon free and um and uh enables people to you know own a piece of this thing that is also going to be distributed freely so it's under a creative commons license yeah one of the things that i think is neat about that nft experiment [591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=591.839s)

is that you know if vitalik were here then we could we could get him to sign the inside of the book and maybe say something you know save something nice and have his physical signature there with the nft experience is actually going to be taking a copy of the pdf book and on the inlet using uh the rsa public private key of an account that vitalik owns and then being able to [617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=617.339s)

insert that as a digital signature on the nft so kind of taking that physical signing experience and bringing it online and that's been i think a fairly successful experiment in raising money for [[public good|public goods]] in the web 3 ecosystem selling those those nfts which i may note i think are non-transferable so there's no speculation or anything involved so i hope to see other book [640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=640.26s)

authors doing experiences like that and bringing the book publishing experience more into the web 3 native ecosystem and anything to add about that yeah and it's also i think important around uh you know we're partnered with an independent publisher called seven stories press uh that for whom this is a very new experience you know this is a press that you know has a deep history [664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=664.079s)

in in you know radical radical imagination is is there a tagline and i really appreciated the willingness to bring you know their history of work with great thinkers like angela davis and octavia butler into conversation with this also kind of science fictional thinking in the best sense that uh you know the vitalik's work represents yeah well i mean i think this conversation [691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=691.5s)

will see saul back and forth between theory and practice and i'd love to push us back towards the theory so we're asking old questions about new technology and connecting the work that's being done in web 3 to age-old questions about how we own and govern our economies what do you think is the most important thing for web3 technologists to understand about the [710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=710.76s)

history of collective organizing and the theory of owning and governing economies that that we can bring forward into the web3 ecosystem i think a lot of it is uh i think of it as a two-way street you know when my best answer to that question is actually to say we need to learn from each other um the thing that you know there are a few things going on in the crypto world [736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=736.74s)

that for instance i think are really important for this kind of cooperative legacy to learn um one uh there is the creativity the froth the imagination i mean in building for instance get coined dao um you're you you and your team were rethinking um what kind of interfaces should governance have how do people allocate [760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=760.68s)

their voting power so that participation is best aligned with power so that the people who really understand the questions at stake you know are the ones hoping to make decisions through delegation for instance um the the the creativity that these these new technologies have opened up for the reinvention of self-governance you know is thrilling and it's something [783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=783.779s)

that you know in my meetings with like heads of credit unions i i so often wished we could you know we could bring that spirit into the room um also a a kind of uh openness to possibilities that we we even forget are closed down the the ability to share ownership through tokens i think has opened up again the conversation about what we should expect of technology you [810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=810.959s)

know we live in a world where you know we might not know it but it's actually hard or possibly illegal for tech companies to share ownership with their users um and uh for instance in 2018 uber and airbnb asked the sec could we please share some stock with users who use our platforms so that they'll be more loyal and things like that and the government [836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=836.519s)

said no um tokens have enabled uh experiments in actually reminding ourselves that this is a this is a good idea we should be sharing ownership along the lines of use and contribution and we should be sharing maybe even just governance um we should be able to explore that space and so cryptos reminded us [858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=858.899s)

actually how much we're we've been in straight jackets in terms of what we're we're legally allowed to do what we're legally allowed to share now in terms of what what this uh you know what the the crypto world can learn from this longer legacy there are tons of experiences and models in that legacy that uh that i think are incredibly powerful forms of shared purchasing forms of uh uh [886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=886.139s)

distributing ownership and governance that have been tried and tested for for decades the you the the structure of how dividends work in cooperatives based on what's called patronage you know of it that you receive financially in proportion to your use of the business the sense in which in which ownership rights behave a little differently than governance [912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=912.24s)

rights and then also the recognition that sometimes you don't need to reinvent everything as much fun as reinvention can be a lot of cooperatives in their day-to-day existence look a lot like you know the the the investor-owned business down the street you know my credit union you walk into it it looks a lot like the wells fargo across the street [936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=936.36s)

but what matters is that little you know that little difference which is that who is that credit union ultimately accountable to you know so sometimes you don't need to reinvent everything you just need to to shift power where it matters most yeah refi summer has arrived and cello is here for it cello is the layer one blockchain for the [[regenerative finance]] movement it's fast planet positive and built for the real world celo has committed towards producing a sustainable future from the very beginning and is the world's first carbon negative evm compatible layer 1 blockchain cell has become much more than a technology a currency a community or even just a layer one cello is a movement to create conditions of prosperity for everyone you can soon engage with all of this via green asset uniswap pools on cello benefiting reforestation and other regenerative products through the toucan protocol moss and more refi is also about the health of communities and resource network is creating bankless infrastructure for circular trade and mutual credit networks to benefit small businesses and local economies all on sellout follow along on twitter to learn more about how cello is accelerating doing refi summer for a positive impact on people communities and the planet if you're attending ecc visit the cello saloon to learn about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web 3 support and [1011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1011.42s)

a non-custodial wallet opera lets you access defy apps quickly and easily the opera wallet has buy sell and swap features and of course lets you view your beautiful nfts but the browser still lets you use any crypto wallet extension you prefer giving you the choice and flexibility for the web through world opera lets you view and manage all of your assets across all the [1028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1028.04s)

blockchains all at once and offers seamless multi-chain support between ethereum bitcoin polygon binding exchange and other evms and layer twos but opera goes even deeper than that opera has a built-in homepage for crypto natives with the opera crypto corner with price charts news feeds nft updates to make sure you are always on top of your game and it even has discord and [1046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1046.339s)

telegram integrated natively into the browser that's crazy opera is truly building the battle station for the crypto world check out opera both on mobile with android and ios apps and on desktop too yeah i mean for me a lot of this comes back to this idea from political theory that the consent of the governed is the only legitimate basis for governance as opposed to like the [1066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1066.799s)

divine rights of kings um you know in the feudal age and when i look at a lot of investor owned corporations i sort of feel like their incentives are not aligned with their users and you sort of as a management team of a web 2 startup i remember feeling like i have my users on one side and i have my investors on the other side and you hit a certain growth stage [1087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1087.559s)

in your vc the investors are like well it's time to extract from these users now and if you can make that more of a closed loop then you have more legitimacy and hopefully more long-term growth ironically and so um you know the threat i'd love to pull is exit to community which i think is a meme project slash movement that you've been involved in to allow founders to give an [1108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1108.08s)

opportunity to exit to community which i understand means selling shares to the users of these projects projects can you tell me how that went and what you've learned from being involved in that movement yeah for me this was a out of a recognition after working with co-ops and also with uh kind of more conventional startup founders for uh for a long time was recognizing that there [1133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1133.22s)

was kind of a gulf a lot of times a founder might be interested in what in shared ownership in some form but because of decisions they'd made earlier on becoming a co-op was just not in the cards right models that or experiences challenges that that required a bit more flexibility but where some kind of shared ownership might be a an opportunity or shared governance [1158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1158.96s)

things like you know the case of bitcoin which i think is a really fascinating example of of a kind of shared building you know a community of uh of shared governance through the the gtc token but the um the idea with exit to community was to invite people into a conversation about how could we bring more community ownership and governance into [1186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1186.919s)

uh into the you know the the companies the projects that we care about um when we look at the kinds of case studies of of uh of who's taken this up it's so diverse and and that's something i love about it it's not a model it's a it's an invitation so uh projects like open collective that were funded by you know early stage investors but found a [1211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1211.46s)

way to buy out those investors and put the [[open source]] communities and and mutual aid groups and other organizations uh on that platform uh in charge that's still a public conversation that they're having um you know with companies that have done uh initial public offerings but have found ways to shift power to for instance their employees [1236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1236.419s)

projects where they're using purpose trusts putting shares in a trust that serves a certain purpose one way or another figuring out how to mature companies or other kinds of projects into appropriate stewardship so that the people who are really affected by what it does are the people also who have the most stake voice and and receive the benefits and [1264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1264.5s)

you know this is an ongoing challenge i was kind of surprised at how much this language kind of got taken up in the crypto world um but i really shouldn't have been because um you know it is in this you know because of these technologies that actually sharing ownership with communities has become much more [1285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1285.08s)

possible than it is and again it reminds us how much our the structure of our economic world of our economic regimes has been designed to actually prevent shared ownership and and i hope that you know this moment is a serves as a reminder that this is something we should be fighting for and demanding right yeah i totally agree you know i love what you said about the exit to [1310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1310.58s)

community movement having such a diverse base of case studies because i think there's a lot of opportunity for projects to to work for each other and you know i i think that my mind also goes to just the privilege um that that i have to be here in new york city uh in the shed in this really upscale building with all of you and all of the privilege that i've had in my [1336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1336.5s)

life that has brought me to a place where i can be involved in in uh in creating a get coin and you know i think being able to make sense of the world and to be able to create an impact on the world is a position of of privilege and i've been very lucky thus far to uh be sort of in the frontier and one of the things that i really hope that we're able to do is to backport that uh those [1358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1358.4s)

lessons to people who are less fortunate and have less privilege so that they can have agency over the world as well and so i think if we're successful the lessons that we have in the exit to community movement and around share and ownership are going to benefit people who are just less lucky than than guys like like me and you and so um i just wanted to make sure that we [1383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1383.24s)

that we noted that before we moved on yeah and and i mean one thing i've noticed in in this work is like how many people who are who find themselves in positions leading companies um uh or building projects you know creating things that take off how much they would like better options right um how much like the the present exit strategies of ipo or get acquired or [1408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1408.26s)

whatever it is are often not actually the things that they most want for their projects um and and that they get steered through particular structures and you know watching for instance how how you thought through the question of how to decentralize bitcoin how to how to deal with where it had come and move it toward where it needed to go next and [1432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1432.62s)

and and how that process has continued viewed as new leaders have come up in in the in the community and in the dow you know is an example of of that grasping and and you know i a lot of what i've been trying to do over the last few years is like just say yes to that urge you know to recognize yeah we need to work together [1455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1455.96s)

to find better options to find better pathways better uses of that of that privilege of that opportunity yeah and also i got to convince my investors and my users and all the people who've invested in me uh in non-financial ways along the way so um you know there's this there's this stigmergic sort of uh path that's being laid here where if one or two or three [1480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1480.5s)

founders can prove that collective ownership or collective governance is possible than that enables a whole tranche of other entrepreneurs uh cohort of other entrepreneurs to go to their investors and say this is possible which hopefully creates 30 or 50 which can then just fractal outwards and so i think that that's what social movements are it's proving that it's possible and [1502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1502.94s)

moving out of the system that just moves us from seed to series a to series c to selling to google and creating a new path of success i think is how we're going to export those ideas to the rest of the world and it's really exciting and it's something that for me a purpose that history has served for me right in recognizing that we that this stuff is possible you know for instance when i [1527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1527.539s)

get discouraged i think of the 130 billion dollar cooperative bank down the road from us in denver um that was built up from generations of struggle by farm workers across the united states insisting on the need for farmer-controlled financing through their cooperatives uh you know i think of my grandfather who ran a cooperative [1549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1549.679s)

business at the end of his life in the hardware industry enabling small hardware stores to to stay in business as the that industry got consolidated through you know banding together all these kinds of examples seeing this legacy at work beginning to notice it around us like even things like the cooperative lurking in the supply chain for dairy queen you know [1576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1576.38s)

like these things are everywhere and uh and uh the more you see that the more you feel that sense that oh this is possible of course we do need to rediscover how to do it in the context of this supercharged tech economy fueled by venture capital which by the way too is not a natural feature of the of the universe you know venture capital exists as a flow in our economy because the [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1605.0s)

federal government began to permit it particularly with a change too it's called the prudent man rule in 1979 you know it was a decision to permit that kind of financing and not other kinds of financing at that scale so um you know so when when you that history i think enables us to recognize ah we could have done things differently before and we have choices before us now [1630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1630.919s)

technology is not inevitability technology is a site of struggle and you know to be honest i'm very worried about how that struggle is going right now yeah can you say more about what worries you and what signs you would like to see yeah totally so to me the biggest worry is that again the the kind of to use a yeah uh sat where the subjectivity of the of the [1658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1658.88s)

investor is still being treated as the primary focus of of both the culture and the regulation of this new technology that that who are regulators worried about they're worried about you know investors getting in trouble people who are just putting up capital when there is an opportunity actually to see a chance for a much wider sector of the population to [1684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1684.919s)

share in the ownership and governance of what's going on so for instance both in the culture in crypto as well as in the conversation among regulators you know we're mapping this assumption that investors should control the economy into the draft rulemaking instead i think what we could be thinking about is how can we recognize hey this is an opportunity to really [1708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1708.14s)

widen uh the opportunities for participation in ownership and governance of enterprise this should be a chance for us to say hey let's make sure that we have a framework so that users really can participate in owning the things that they contribute to to creating value for how can we make sure to do that safely how can we make sure that the the incredibly creative [1734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1734.0s)

possibilities for governance in these um in these spaces is something that we protect we encourage that creativity we encourage people to program new kinds of voting systems new kinds of delegation systems uh uh uh even old kinds of of systems into these new into these new tools you know one thing i'm really excited about is the return of juries which were the form of democracy the [1761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1761.6s)

most uh prominent form of democracy in ancient athens they're starting to recur uh in crypto land you know i want to make sure that that space of of democratic creativity and shared ownership is what we're concerned to protect not just the the people who happen to have the capacity to be investors right um you know i think that the two words [1787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1787.88s)

that sort of came to mind as you're speaking there is the difference between a consumer who just passively consumes goods and services in a citizen which actually has a say in the governance of hopefully their local community their nation and and the various systems that that they're a part of and i guess what would have to be true to move thousands or millions of people from consumers to [1813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1813.98s)

citizens what does high resolution democracy in the web age even even look like because i think that for for many people democracy and voting and citizenry kind of feels like showing up to vote every two maybe four years you know uh and so so how how do we make that leap well to to have to be able to imagine a citizen i think you need a jurisdiction you know [1839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1839.12s)

you need a space and that's something that that web3 tools actually open up and important way to give you an example in the early 90s there was a famous article in the village voice called it was called a rape in cyberspace it was about an early online community dealing with a case of virtual sexual assault and it was a fascinating story the space was called lambdamu [1863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1863.899s)

because there was this really problematic character in it the community starts figuring out ways to deal with this problem and they end up like building a framework for self-governing their community through democratic processes but then actually the people running the servers were sitting at you know the zero xerox park facility you know owned by a corporation [1886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1886.399s)

and realized you know what everything that happens is actually our legal liability and so we actually can't let you control this democratically and that kind of pattern is played out in all of our corporate governance server-based online spaces and one thing that crypto does kind of open up is is rather than being centrally controlled by default you know it doesn't just by [1912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1912.2s)

default the the default of a blockchain is is distributed ownership is participant ownership and so it does open this this possibility of having jurisdictions that are not ultimately reducible to a particular you know corporate entity or geographic location and so that creates opportunity for us to think about democracy not just in our territorial jurisdictions those are [1940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1940.34s)

important too territory land stewardship of land is never going to not be important but our virtual spaces are important too you and increasingly so and so i i think this this uh this opens a door for us to start practicing democracy in those kinds of jurisdictions in the ways appropriate to them that this is a kind of 1776 moment uh a chance to write the the social [1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1967.46s)

contracts together um uh uh in a way that that you know begins the process of building democracy there and and to do that we need to recognize the need to have a much broader uh uh conversation than for instance happen in 70 1776 where democracy excluded uh enslaved people and excluded the people whose land was being colonized through that system and [1995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=1995.84s)

instead recognize we have an opportunity to heal to to do repair to do reparations uh to build a more inclusive society in these in these in these emerging jurisdictions to be to to actually not just import the logic of citizenship but kind of shift the meaning of citizenship into what we really need it to be i mean are you kind of talking about the [2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2022.36s)

internet as a public space then are we talking about building a [[network state]] here what is what is this like do you have a tangible example of of something that you can collectively govern through digital spaces in this 1776 moment i i think i think we're seeing a bunch of those i mean a dao something like what what bitcoin has become you know it for those of you who don't know an [2045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2045.039s)

amazing platform protocol now uh online community enabling resources to be distributed to [[public good|public goods]] in in the in the crypto ecosystem um you know this is a you know could be an example that kind of jurisdiction something that you know there is some legal attachment to territorial government in this context [2067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2067.839s)

but it's more than that it's got its it's it's got its [[smart contract|smart contracts]] as well that are on blockchain's uh on a blockchain that is that is managed and and processed around the world you see something like the the ens system the ethereum name service kind of domain name system for the ethereum ecosystem that is uh you know also has this kind of shared ownership and governance to it [2094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2094.72s)

you know these are i think of these as like proto-jurisdictions um even thinking of something like the merge that happens this month when ethereum shifted over to um to proof of of stake that was a major kind of policy shift that required a political process and it has consequences for the planet it dramatically reduce the carbon [2120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2120.3s)

emissions of the ethereum blockchain and and in that sense i think we're seeing these systems become start to act as jurisdictions and then you have something like you know a project that's recently come out of of bitcoin is is the passport right this question of okay if we have new jurisdictions how do we represent identity and that's a tremendously exciting you know for [2146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2146.98s)

engineers that's often like a scary and hard problem for i think it's a really exciting one i think back to my reporting you know with a trans catholics for instance people who are who who were running up against the state um and its control over representation of identity and compare i remember being in rooms with people like comparing [2170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2170.44s)

notes about how does this state handle you know um uh representations of gender as opposed to this state and we have a chance to actually go back to the drawing board and say how do we want to represent our identities you know as participants or citizens or whatever kind of metaphor we import into these new jurisdictions and so when you you [2190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2190.48s)

know you build something like the the passport to solve an engineering problem in the in the get coin ecosystem it's also a chance to to explore these big questions of how do we want to um represent and um and verify and confirm and make reliable our attestations of identity yeah well thank you uh incredibly kind i promise that wasn't just a slow pitch [2220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2220.06s)

for you to she'll get coined back to everyone but uh it's convenient that we share that sort of design space myself as a builder and and you sort of studying this space um i wanted to give a 10 minute warning to the audience that we're gonna do uh about 10 minutes worth of q a in 10 minutes so if you have a question brewing then we'll be passing around [2241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2241.42s)

mike's in about 10 minutes so um i want to talk next about this this vision of exit to community slash governance of projects in the web 3 internet public space creates new jurisdictions in which we can become more citizens than consumers and uh you know one of the things that you know is really exciting for me about that is it's a place to build it's a place where [2273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2273.46s)

we can build new infrastructures hyperstructures is a meme that's been been thrown around the web three space basically like an institution in the ether that has the property of hardness in that you can rely on it you know if bitcoin was a hyper structure you would be able to rely on [[quadratic funding]] being around for the next i don't know two to five years and you know that [2291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2291.76s)

property of hardness is something that you rely on in an institution in a public space and you can't have hardness and you can't have new institutions without building and i contrast that with the wider movement towards [[social media]] over the last 10 or 15 years basically kind of since occupy since we realized that the old institutions weren't really working that i feel like [2311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2311.98s)

[[social media]] which is what has hit scale really has the capacity to tear down institutions and people and movements but i haven't seen the ability to actually construct instead of destruct and i'm wondering if you could talk about your your thoughts on [[social media]] relative to democracy and um you know how do we go from [[social media]] tearing things down to actual [[collective intelligence]] that can build things up and create new institutions that can that we can rely on i think there's a lot there but there's enough for for you to put it in the pot and stir it maybe yeah there's so you know we focus so much on what [[social media]] has enabled that we forget what it both the good and bad um we forget what it has actually disabled and what it is really not good for and what has not enabled us to do so you know a couple examples one in those social movements of 2011 that you know we're so much a part of my my work as a reporter um you know they were incredibly uh effective those movements powered in [2377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2377.26s)

in important ways you know not entirely but important ways by [[social media]] in creating waves of disruption of gathering attention you know even uh you know knocking off some dictators in the process um for a time uh what they were not great at is holding power uh zainiptopekshi the media scholar [2404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2404.5s)

distinguishes signal and capacity they're great at signal they're not so great at building capacity um and uh and that's a really important recognition that was one of the things that made me really interested in ethereum hey this is a form of online space a a framework in online space to actually build financial and organizational capacity in ways that you [2429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2429.4s)

know your twitter feed or or uh or in you know tick tock algorithms are just terrible for um and and also governance you know doing the kind of the kind of appropriate accountable forms of governance process are very very hard in online space and this is i think one of the uh drivers of what has come to i think really unfortunately be called [2456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2456.28s)

cancel culture is kind of a co-optation of of language out of black twitter by kind of more reactionary forces but that idea that that it's either you've got a bunch of fans or everybody's clobbering you and wants you to disappear off the face of the earth i think it's kind of a a response to the fact that we don't have a way to hold people accountable more appropriately [2480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2480.82s)

um you know i've been in some of those like waves of cancellation and realized in the process like oh if this was another kind of space we would have like we would have a process of of identifying what was actually the harm done and how do we repair that particular harm rather than like totally do away with the person we don't have the ability to do like [2502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2502.839s)

um a kind of trial or a kind of a kind of accountability process through these tools we don't have the ability when somebody is an admin in an online space for instance to like even vote them off for a little while you know as we would in other kinds of civic spaces and and we have to be attentive to what online space does not allow us to do and what do we actually need from it and and so a [2531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2531.88s)

lot of my work lately is on online governance particularly with the meta governance project and it's been about you know in some respects tried to catch up to the practices of old civic spaces how do we translate those online i think a lot about my mother's garden club which is a very like sophisticated but very common type of of bylaws and and structure to hold people accountable [2558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2558.119s)

um and and and you see um you see this happen you see responses arising in different contexts i i've been looking at two different cultures alongside each other lately you know things going on in in the crypto world particularly in dao's around self-governance and also things happening in the transformative justice and prison and police abolition [2581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2581.5s)

movements both of those you know they have very different cultures that they're working you know from very different directions but both of them are very concerned about the current state of like how [[social media]] works both of them are trying to imagine a society in which in which rules and and economies and processes are not ultimately grounded in the violence of a [2604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2604.839s)

cop with a gun and they're both trying to imagine their way into a very different kind of world one in which we have the kinds of processes and and skills and habits that we need to to have a kind of radically more democratic life so you know as different as those as those movements are i think they have something really powerfully in common immutable x is the layer 2 platform for [2631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2631.74s)

crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9 000 transactions per second an instant transaction confirmation no more gas fees no more waiting around for your transaction to clear immutable's [[zero knowledge]] roll up finally unlocks the world of crypto gaming immutable x is the only gas-free nft minting platform with over 26 million nfts minted all [2651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2651.04s)

with zero gas fees with the power of immutable gaming developers don't also need to become [[smart contract]] developers they just need to plug in to immutable's api and instantly start unlocking the full potential of crypto assets inside of games this is why world-class companies and projects have decided to deploy on a mutable x like gamestop ember sword planet quest alluvium tick [2670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2670.72s)

coherence in [[collective intelligence]] in these web3 systems instead of just e-coherence when are we going to have social movements that can have hold power uh uh when are we going to have signal and capacity through the internet and like when occupy wall street but on web web 3 rails i think the answer is kind of simple in some respects when we build it and also [2768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2768.4s)

when we you know when we demanded and struggle for it right you know when we build it which is you know recognition that technology does not build itself it gets built by the economic forces that pay to build it and we have to you know as you've done with bitcoin you know build new kinds of economic models that actually fund and support the things that we need rather than being parasitic [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2793.119s)

on the stuff that that a particular investment business model wants to build uh and then second you know is the demanded side is recognized to the extent that we are building within the confines of of of regulatory regimes demand that that shared ownership shared governance uh get the respect and the space that they need uh to be built and to be built in a way that is that is [2823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2823.839s)

safe that is available uh to uh to the people doing the building recognizing that this is a space of of contest and struggle it is a space that has not been built that is not in every in any way inevitable uh and uh and when we recognize that i think it shifts our attention from the question of whether you know whether crypto is good or crypto is bad whether this is good or [2851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2851.859s)

bad to how how do we build it that is the interesting question uh that is the question that i would love you know more of my kind of long time comrades to be focused on uh rather than like can we please ignore this yeah yeah i mean i i think that i'm certainly greenpilled uh but you know i think that maybe i'd love to hear when we get [2877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2877.06s)

into q a from the audience from people who are more crypto skeptical uh about that um you know one area that that i want to come back and land on before we get into q a uh again is just this this question of privilege um and like you know someone like me who didn't have any student debt and has a computer science degree and like learned [2896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2896.44s)

to play the vc game when i was 22. uh i think has like gotten to wiggle room to a position of freedom where i can kind of like i feel like i can i can i can make bets they're somewhat larger and or someone in this space there's a venn diagram of like what's going to put food on the table for my kids and like put them through college and what do i really believe and at the intersection [2920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2920.079s)

of that is the sliver of of of uh modules that that i'm looking to deploy or be involved in and um you know i guess where this comes back to me for me is like is citizen really compatible with wealth inequality um in a world where one percent of the population has somewhat like 50 of of all the wealth and you know for the [2947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2947.44s)

median citizen uh uh that is just trying to put food on the table for their kids or get them through college or get through another day you don't have the long-termism to actually systemically change the forces of oppression that have their boot on your neck and so um you know like what would you say to someone who wants to see these systems built but is just trying to put food on [2969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2969.28s)

the table and like maybe they have to prioritize in their day working 12-hour shifts instead of voting instead of being involved in citizenry you know what would you say to someone like that well it it's not a question of what i say i mean for instance my lab right now is doing a project called sacred stacks where we're working with and learning from a a group of of grassroots [2990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=2990.28s)

communities that are exploring these technologies and it is really you see that that question of privilege and possibility very clearly there you know people are putting out fires all day they do not have time to fuss around on metamask right and and we that's something that we're experiencing in these conversations very very directly at the same time i think it comes into [3014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3014.06s)

questions of design for those who are you know who do find themselves in the positions of of building these tools right now what are you prioritizing what rights are you encoding into into these tools for instance if you look down the you know the list of the the un declaration of human rights well you know blockchains are building in a sense of in some cases is privacy that's [3039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3039.66s)

that's a right on the un declaration they're building in property rights are very very strong you know you get your thing it's yours but for instance are we encoding economic justice you know making sure that uh you know that we're counteracting the power of the wealthy over the power of of the less wealthy you know we could also be programming those into [3066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3066.0s)

blockchains you know what about the rights of earth are we programming in you know we could be writing protocols that that uh do not permit carbon emissions to be fueling the um the confirmation of transactions you know you could have people who are able to confirm that oh i found that this minor is being fueled by carbon emissions and then the protocol just takes them off [3089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3089.16s)

the system uh you know we could be building technologies with those kinds of values in mind um and you know so far that has not been the priority so i think there there is uh we have to recognize that these these technologies are actually encoding values already they're encoding you know economic hierarchies already um and that we could be doing these [3114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3114.78s)

differently and and and those conversations i think our our conversations that we all need to be having and then we need to invite not just those who you know who who are have access to the kind of privileges you're talking about um but that it's a much wider public conversation about what kinds of protocols do we really want and do we [3133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3133.92s)

really need yeah yeah i mean i know for me uh it's always important as an entrepreneur not to try to swallow the whole elephant at once and i view this whole thing as an iterative evolutionary game in which we're going between boom and bust fear and greed every three to four years and um every capital rotation i i would love to see more talent and capital rotate [3155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3155.52s)

towards things that are good for the world and good for the median citizenry of humanity in a way from like monkey jpegs and ponzi schemes like if we can just turn the capital rotation scheme every boom bust cycle a little bit towards that i think eventually we can reach that median citizen let's call it in 10 years 2032. what did jpegs have their place [3177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3177.26s)

that's true i mean there is value and uselessness yeah um yeah i i mean i think that they do but uh you know in terms of the economic system that that i want to design there there may be seventh on the priority list um anything less to say before we move into q a now let's move on okay all right i [3197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3197.339s)

hope someone asks nathan about his affinity for monkey jpegs uh so we have runners who have microphones who if just please just raise your hand if you have a question first person i saw is you there in the back middle and i'll just remind everyone that questions are maybe a few sentences and end in a question mark uh because we only have nine minutes left [3221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3221.22s)

thank you hi how are you hi good how are you um i have a couple questions so the first one is one big criticism of dials is that they are trying to unnecessarily reinvent hundreds of years of thought on corporate governance and that there are some ways in which corporations are just more effective and efficient than dogs can be uh what is your answer to that [3242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3242.76s)

and my second question is what are some like real world examples of like governance short-term governance experiments we can run with dallas to sort of prove this concept to crypto skeptics and people outside of crypto governance experiments or arguments for dows over corporations you've done it more than i have yeah um well i'm supposed to be the moderator [3268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3268.74s)

here but uh i'll i'll take the i'll take a swing at that um i do think that in many places dallas are dows are a design space that is exploring what properties immutable transparent programmable global ledgers can bring to governance and in some cases that'll just mean taking corporate governance and putting it on chain and you'll have a company that has global [3291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3291.72s)

jurisdiction um and then there's there's also new things that are non-scheomorphic which just basically means enabled by the digital that's going to be enabled by uh by by dowels and you know for example [[quadratic funding]] is just way more efficient on for global [[public good|public goods]] like [[open source]] software and [[climate change]] is just way more efficient because blockchains have a global jurisdiction and it's programmable and you can automate a lot of of the governance stuff that you could have done before so i see dallas as a yes and to traditional corporate governance and not a replacement for it but i think maybe our cyberpunk friends would be a little bit more anarchist and and uh want to completely replace them nathan [3335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3335.22s)

you want to take a shot yeah i mean i think traditional corporations are really good at what they're designed for you know siphoning maximizing profits back to investors they have a particular optimization function right and i think what's exciting about dows is the opportunity to try to optimize for other things and to redesign what we could be [3356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3356.76s)

optimizing for and also that global jurisdiction that ability to build internet native things i've run into a lot of problems with co-ops that are operating globally but really have a hard time sharing ownership and governance globally because they're it they're grounded in territorial jurisdictions and so i think there is a need to you know rethink the enterprise [3381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3381.359s)

at this that is network native great question thank you uh let's go to you next uh we'll get you next yeah pointing is hard okay so um i wanted to ask about cryptographic privacy i i wanted i i imagine you've seen the tornado cash sanctions i want to ask if in in this proverbial [3409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3409.2s)

um occupy in web 3 is is there uh a fourth amendment so to speak right so do you do you think that the right to privacy should be there um or or maybe not maybe you think they're nefarious actors or something like that so just wanted to see or take i mean we were just a a few days ago with um the founder of zcash for [3432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3432.599s)

instance who's also based in boulder and and um he and we were talking about this and talking about how privacy is is a set of choices it's not a fixed thing it's not a fixed uh algorithm that you can apply to every case and i think that's actually a very exciting feature of the of what's emerging in the crypto universe is that different kinds of use [3456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3456.18s)

cases are producing different you know tools for privacy in different contexts do you want your transaction to be public but who you are is is private or do you want the whole transaction to be private you know there's a whole palette of options starting to emerge here and i think that's i think that's good another piece of it though too is where [3478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3478.319s)

that i'm interested in is where does rulemaking come in where do we say to enough is enough how do we create forms of of regulation and intervention that prevent harms against human beings and the and the ecology of our planet while also preserving the right kinds of privacy so i think that if we approach this as an either or or a maximalist versus minimalist vision we're going to [3505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3505.319s)

be stuck if we see this as a creative design space you know i think we have a a really exciting new tool set to work with and address those kinds of questions foreign let's go to you and the blue mask right there okay first off thank you all both so much um i think maybe my question can be summarized and like three or four bullet points governance is hard and non-trivial governance is something that we definitely are severely out of practice with like our self-governance and participation into the process is something that we're out of practice with and therefore how can we kind of rebuild that knowledge of how [3548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3548.579s)

to self-govern and what lessons can we take from traditional forms or like weather co-ops or um like neighborhood associations or otherwise i i love that so much because i you know that word experience has been in my mind a lot lately partly recognizing my own like why am i obsessed with this stuff i i've been realizing more and more how [3573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3573.359s)

much has to do with like when i was a teenager i had particular experiences of like democratic governance working functionally in at my school like in my in very small spaces that gave me i think an outside sense of like yeah we can do this it's okay um but that sense of skills is i think really important it's something for instance you know one of the one of the [3599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3599.099s)

people i've been learning from in the transformative justice movement um adrian marie brown really centers is like we have lost our skills of democratic practice and so you know one thing i'm really excited about in the work that we're doing in the meta governance project is like is how do we see those skills how do we create spaces and experiences that help people develop [3620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3620.76s)

a sense of confidence again around our capacity to self-govern and i think that actually a lot of the decline of democracy around the world might have something to do with the fact that like in our daily online lives as so many of us are involved in like we're just forgetting that we could do this that yes governance is hard but it's not that hard you know and like a bunch of you [3643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3643.619s)

know people are like how could you have a company that's owned by by zillions of workers or or users it's like we have companies owned by zillions of investors and that works out you know for them okay you know so is i think that question of skills is just so dead on and i think of it as as just like so front and center for the kinds of things that you know that we need to be [3669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3669.72s)

building so thank you yeah i would i would just add really quick that like until we get to the place where we've built the skills uh one of the things that i've been thinking about is building governance systems that don't feel like governance so on get coin grants every quarter there's three million dollars worth of matching that's available for you to [3685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3685.92s)

fund the [[public good|public goods]] that you rely on [[open source]] software [[climate change]] diversity equity and inclusion and when you contribute a dollar your funds are basically it feels like you're funding something like an e-commerce experience but if you turn it on its side and you look at it it's actually governing where the matching pools are going to so you create like a cart checkout experience [3705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3705.599s)

that feels like an e-commerce experience but it's actually governing like tricky you just govern something um and we've got 700 000 data points of what the ethereum community cares about every every quarter which is just some higher resolution democracy web scale democracy so but but what i want to i think we should be building those skills uh in the meantime [3724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3724.5s)

i think we have time for maybe one more question did i see a hand up over here i just wanted to come back to the piece of privilege that you're discussing earlier because something that i've experienced is when there's not a clear pathway to you know like a business model or like a pathway for labor compensation in like an emergent space how do you ensure that the people who [3752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3752.819s)

are building in that emergence even have the capacity to join or to participate um and i'm interested in your perspective on the i promise we wouldn't say what we were talking about refer back to earlier conversations but it's something that we were just discussing was was what uh what should compensation and look like in these global dows what does what does [3781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3781.98s)

pay equity and pay justice look like when we really do have the capacity to involve people from around the world who are living in very different economic contexts or in one place that are living in very different economic contexts you know again i think that is a question that we just must not um allide you know it's a question that that is another opportunity for us to go [3805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3805.2s)

deep and it's a reminder of the things that the existing frameworks of the of the economy today kind of sometimes let us ignore you know they let us say okay we're a u.s corporation therefore we're going to follow this set of rules but if we're not under such a jurisdiction it invites us to ask those questions in in radical new ways um you know i i think part of the the [3832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3832.14s)

critical appeal of something like global jurisdictions is global justice you know is is is redistribution is is is equalizing the capacity of people in many different kinds of contexts to uh to access you know the uh just rewards for what they contribute and again to me just this is this is a vital conversation something that you know that that we must not put off [3863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3863.4s)

um when we to the extent that we put it off is the extent to which we ride on the privilege that you know that some of us might have uh while others are left out of the conversation yeah um a hard hard question to answer with only a few seconds left but um i just want to say directly that uh i think this is [3883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3883.38s)

under explored space i don't think that the legacy system explores it all that well my view is that we have to have uh funding for things that are [[public good|public goods]] and for community oriented i love that in [[quadratic funding]] you're funded based off of whether your peers believe what you're doing is important not whether you're going to have it turn a profit in a couple years and so more things that [3902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3902.4s)

fund [[public good|public goods]] in communities is what i would like to see but again i am in a position of privilege uh to have access to that network and capital and not everyone else is um i want to thank you nathan for having this conversation with me i want to thank the audience for joining this has been really very special for me and we will be downstairs milling around the [3921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8&t=3921.48s)

lobby if anyone wants to shake hands and and chat more thank you so much thanks nathan thank you kevin it's a pleasure applause music
