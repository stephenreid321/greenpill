foreign music ation on the pod today we have david ehrlichmann who is the author of a book about [[impact network|impact networks]] and also the co-founder of the hats protocol so basically [[impact network|impact networks]] has been a really influential thing for me a because networks are a basic unified pattern uh that we see all over the world from biological networks neural [24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=24.0s)

networks to economic networks to now dowels as networks and so basically [[impact network|impact networks]] which david has written a book on and we go into in this episode are a really great approach or structure to understand when you're facing complex issues and with greater levels of connectivity are needed between individuals in order to address the issue than would otherwise be available [47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=47.52s)

to you so we talk about learning networks action networks and movement networks in this episodes the five c's of [[impact network|impact networks]] clarifying purpose in principles convening the people cultivating trust coordinating actions and collaborating for systems change and so we kind of go back and forth between theory and action in this episode david's also a founder has implemented [68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=68.64s)

this stuff in the past and can abstract the theory out but has the object level experience of implementing it and i think that's why he said it's a fascinating person to talk to and honestly [[impact network|impact networks]] is one of my favorite books that i've read in the last few years so what are the ways that we can leverage networks to create more impact than we could in a hierarchical [87](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=87.36s)

organization what do these lessons of [[impact network|impact networks]] have to do with dows what does dow leadership look like how can we foster self-organization promote emergence embrace change and hold dynamic tensions in these networks i just think that david is so experienced so lucid and he's building dial software so there's lots of great lessons in this episode with david ehrlichmann so [110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=110.34s)

without further ado i give you david when we're going to be talking about [[impact network|impact networks]] enjoy the world has woken up to refi and celo is here for it celo is the layer one for the [[regenerative finance]] movement it's fast planet positive and built for the real world celo has committed to producing a sustainable future from day one and has built its technology around one of the [129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=129.42s)

lowest carbon impact consensus mechanisms and is the world's first carbon negative evm compatible layer 1 blockchain cello is a movement to create the conditions of prosperity for everyone whether it's tokenizing carbon credits with toucan providing capital to underserved communities with unicorn or building for millions of users around the globe cello was created to transform [149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=149.4s)

crypto enthusiasts into a movement of change makers follow along on twitter at celloorg to learn more about how cello is accelerating refi for a positive lasting impact on people communities and the planet and if you're a builder interested in refi be sure to join the build with cello hackathon live now with a prize pool of over a hundred thousand dollars coin shift is a leading treasury [171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=171.36s)

book about [[impact network|impact networks]] so let's get into it what is an [[impact network]] well what is a network a network is a web of relationships that connects people or things and everybody is aware of the social networks around us really networks are everywhere there are neural networks in our brains mycl networks underneath forest floor is the technological networks like the web [254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=254.879s)

providers and cables that make up the internet we know about social networks that people we become connected to but a lot of people don't recognize though is that networks can be deliberately organized and coordinated to do so much more than just create connection they can also be organized and coordinated to spark shared learning and increase the flow of information [276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=276.419s)

they can be organized around action and they can be organized to connect social movements together and change mindsets those are different forms of [[impact network|impact networks]] learning networks action networks movement networks networks deliberately organize to produce some kind of impact hmm got it and how did you come to study [[impact network|impact networks]] it it goes way back about 15 years ago i [301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=301.979s)

was working at a non-profit organization and you know there i was noticing that they were doing great work but they were so focused on their own programs and their own organization's health and kind of the annual cycle of fundraising which is totally reasonable it's it's the pressures that the social sector uh fundraising processes put these organizations into we have to show a [329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=329.1s)

direct connection between the funding you get and the impact you create and it really disincentivizes collaboration in a lot of ways and and the work where it's not clear the direct impact you're having but uh you're you're creating some kind of larger systemic change and and so when i was there i started to get really curious about how we could work not just within individual organizations [351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=351.0s)

but really across organizations and across sectors and communities to address these big systemic issues we're faced with so many big systemic complex challenges and to address systemic issues we have to work systemically and that means crossing the silos and the boundaries that that usually separate us so that was kind of the key question that i held in my head it led me to a [373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=373.02s)

year at a consulting firm monitor institute where i learned more about deliberate approaches to multi-stakeholder collaboration and and learn that there were networks out there that were deliberately organized and even staffed to connect upwards of 150 different organizations in one case to reduce carbon emissions across nine states in the midwest and that network [397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=397.319s)

reamp had some pretty amazing impacts and so i started to get really and i've inspired i was kind of a light bulb moment for me oh my gosh it's actually possible to strategically weave organizations together around these bigger issues that we that many of them touch and and so i left that consulting firm and helped to start a network myself that was connecting 48 different [420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=420.12s)

organizational leaders in their organizations to revitalize the city fresno california later i'll start a network of 24 different organizations working to steward half a million acres of land and large landscape stewardship is necessarily a systemic issue as a simple example of that is if you get rid of all the invasive species on your land and your neighbor hasn't done the same [444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=444.78s)

it doesn't much matter right so you have to coordinate at a systems level that means bringing together the government agencies and non-profits and academic institutions and tribal groups and timber companies together and dig in where they disagree a lot of disagreement but also where they do agree and bring the different pieces of the puzzle together to see the whole [463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=463.86s)

system and how we can act and coordinate to improve the health of the whole system long story short you know continued doing that work in a wide variety of fields and all over the world with over 50 different [[impact network|impact networks]] and saw common lessons and patterns that were arising between them even though they were really different in terms of different in terms of the place and the [485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=485.46s)

context and that's what became the book [[impact network|impact networks]] and you know from there after that i i started to really put a lot more attention into what was happening with dows because there was so much overlap in terms of it's all about decentralized coordination how can we coordinate better when decision making is distributed and leadership is [507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=507.96s)

distributed ownership is distributed and and i see the work i was doing with [[impact network|impact networks]] as really a lot of the the social layer and the social technologies of bring different groups and communities together to get things done and then you know dows are really pushing the envelope of any any other space i see of what of the the trust infrastructure or the the systems that [531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=531.959s)

that allow us to coordinate at much much larger scales beyond which we can even know each other or or form relationships with one another and different tools and mechanisms for doing that so uh of the last couple years i've gone all in on web 3 space and and building dows and we can get more in to that but that's that's the story of my progression through [[impact network|impact networks]] nice well um you know i i have read the book [[impact network|impact networks]] and we'll put a link in the show notes we'd recommend it to all of our listeners um because i think that networks are just this unified basic pattern of how we coordinate with each other and by the way i love that you're using my favorite buzzword coordination um as we're talking about this [575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=575.88s)

um it seems like one of the things i wrote in my notes is as i was as i was doing my research for this is that [[impact network|impact networks]] are viable approach when two conditions are met you face a complex issue that you can't solve on your own and you need to weave greater levels of connectivity between individuals or organizations to address the issue so i've always believed that [595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=595.68s)

networks are great because they can sense and respond and assimilate information from the edge of the network whereas a hierarchy top down like the people who are in the trenches you you kind of like don't care what they're seeing on the front lines as much um their hierarchies are good at projecting power in one direction whereas networks are good at [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=613.8s)

assimilating information from a complex issue um and so for me that's like the reductionist why of [[impact network|impact networks]] um would love to get into like how how to build a uh an [[impact network]] but i think could we just synthesize a why before we get into the what and how i think you you said it well they're they're good at different things uh when [635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=635.16s)

we're faced with kind of simple or complicated level problems hierarchies are really good that's when we know there's a beginning and an end we can plan it all out in advance relatively speaking something like you know building a bridge or completing a project there's prior examples uh we can allocate allocate specific roles and responsibilities to get things done and [658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=658.74s)

execute execute right as you said focus our energy on on executing a thing networks are really good at addressing complex level problems where there's not a clear beginning or end when we're kind of in this muck of uncertainty and there's many different approaches that we could take we need to learn our way experiment our way through it as the saying goes crossing the river by [685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=685.32s)

feeling the stones when when we're faced with with complex level problems there's no single person no single organization you can hold all that complexity by themselves we're each just seeing one slice of the picture all right we're each holding just one piece of the puzzle based on our experiences and the the specific piece of the work that we're focused on and so we need to bring [708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=708.42s)

different perspectives together from across the system and do some collective sensemaking first of all just what's what's going on where have we been where we are where might we be going and then start to find some alignment in that and from that collective sensemaking we can identify some points of leverage some places where a small shift in one thing could produce big changes throughout the [730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=730.38s)

system and and start running experiments around those and learning from those experiments and sharing those learnings across the system and continue to adapt and evolve out of that we may may be able to identify some discrete pieces of work that fall back from the complex into the complicated domain and that's where we can then bring back structures even hierarchies to the then go execute [751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=751.8s)

on that and get things done the network is really valuable in terms of engaging large numbers of people in this complex domain and finding our way through it yeah i think one thing as we compare and contrast hierarchies in networks we could maybe note that a hierarchy is a type of network but it's one where orders flow down uh maybe resources flow down and then actions actions flow back [776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=776.399s)

in a network can be like a superset of you could have non-hierarchical networks also that are more focused on connecting and collaborating as opposed to commanding and controlling so so that's a great point networks are hierarchies are also kind of like a type of network also yeah they're they're like a particularly rigid type of network like a hub and [796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=796.44s)

spoke network where there's a single hub in the middle and then spokes and nodes that come out of that hub and they only connect to each other through that central hub right that's the the top of a hierarchy is the same as the the center of a hub and spoke network and we have the same bottlenecks and issues that arise so when we're building [[impact network|impact networks]] or dows it's moving beyond that hub and spoke stage and really creating these multi-hub networks or these dense core of activity and a large diverse periphery of of individuals and actors uh that that's much more fluid and not not dependent on a single person or hub yeah and i'll just note that there's so many beautiful diagrams in the book and try to describe them it's one of those pictures worth a thousand words things [842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=842.339s)

if you look at the diagrams in the book or um you know i wrote this governance post lessons about [[impact network|impact networks]] for dials that we'll link in the show notes also you can really kind of see the density of these networks and looking at them visually i think helps helps to articulate them as well i think i love your post i hope people read your post if you don't read the book just read that pose because it does a great job summarizing and it it pulls a lot of the images out of the book that i was able to to offer up in [[open source]] yeah i was thankful that those were opens were so that i could share them with bitcoin though in that go fest um i'm curious why you think so you know [879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=879.3s)

uh for people who have studied the history of human organization we know about the formation of capital markets the east india corporation being the first corporation um the company has kind of become the most view the the most used vehicle for moving private interests forward and those are always very hierarchical why are networks that are non-hierarchical [902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=902.339s)

sort of resurgent does it have to do with our networked digital way of working or is there something fundamentally different about the 21st century that's more complex that makes networks uh something that we need to that we need to focus on like why networks now it feels like everyone i talk to is is upsets with network apologies and and and that as an [921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=921.42s)

organizing principle yeah i think there's a few reasons you spoke to a couple of them it's the the level of complexity that we're dealing with is bigger and bigger there's a as tomatley has said uh things are getting bigger and bigger better and better worse and worse faster and faster and bigger and bigger ways so this complexity is growing and and with [942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=942.66s)

complexity we we need better approaches to address those levels complexity and bring it back down to in that kind of complicated domain where we can actually then plan and and deliver uh hierarchy is not very good at engaging complex domains where we have to be really fluid and adaptive and and connect really different actors from really different parts of the system hierarchies are really good at planning and executing they and so they've they've evolved to address those types of things and our education system you know we're we have a specific curriculum people are running through the curriculum from point a to point b it's pretty consistent obviously it's leading to a lot of issues too but that's where you know kind of that hierarchical [990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=990.36s)

infrastructure can can make sense it's a really consistent type of delivery but but the world is changing so quickly uh the world is is so different now than it was six months ago so when we are organizing i think we're limited by a single power hierarchy we can still bring in the best of what hierarchies can do and this is what i hope we where we can get to with dows is [1015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1015.139s)

actually blending the best of networks and hierarchies because one isn't inherently better than the other they're just good at different things again hierarchies are really good at the point where we can plan and execute on a particular discrete thing or project or task networks are good at engaging large numbers of people and collectively sensemaking our way through it and so i think [1036](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1036.439s)

we can really actually blend both of those together why networks now also is because we're just i think naturally more connected across these different systems and geographies and silos and so we're seeing the and just so presently aware of the different interconnections of uh and how how all the different issues that we're facing are so interconnected and we can't do we can't [1057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1057.74s)

create impact in a tiny little box because the the work that we're doing is affected and going to affect other issues in in pretty unknowable ways so we have to stay connected we have to be sharing this information and we have to be coordinating our efforts yeah yeah i mean it it feels like a fundamentally useful primitive and so [1083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1083.72s)

like let's say you've convinced me of of the why of networks as a frame um what tell me tell me how to build an [[impact network]] tell me uh what i should know next about uh networks i see this the five c's that you've put in there um you know what are the roles within a network what would what are the sort of primitives of information i need to work in a networked world [1106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1106.46s)

yeah we can we can start there that if i see those those core activities these really just came from pattern recognition that you know these networks have been so different but but they're really consistent activities that keep showing up over and over again and these are not things that you check the box and you're done it's you you're continually revisiting them in every [1124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1124.64s)

step of the process and that's clarifying the purpose and principles of the network why are we getting together what's the thing that aligns us we disagree about many different things but what is something that that aligns us and and then the principles are what are the values or the agreements that we hold that we can hold each other and ourselves accountable to principles are [1147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1147.02s)

are really key in super diffuse networks as well like large social movements where there are local chapters that are taking actions and making decisions locally in our by and large quite autonomous but they're connected together through that shared purpose and the shared principles of how are we going to act what to the the filters we're going to use as we make decisions [1169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1169.76s)

and take actions so clarifying purpose and principles then convening the people just connecting people in all different types of ways in the [[impact network|impact networks]] i've helped build and the ones i've studied so often that that act of convening together is a huge uh hugely important moment it really is what creates this this center of gravity this ball of energy that through which [1194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1194.96s)

relationships are built ideas are generated uh actions are planned out and it this burning hot sun that draws other people in too convening people there's there's really something so valuable about convening the whole system or as much as as possible of the different perspectives etc or or the whole organization together to to step back and kind of see the big picture and do [1220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1220.039s)

that collective sensemaking but connecting convenient people can also happen kind of individually virtually in person different ways it's really about accelerating the flows of information then cultivating trust so how do we how do we build relationships networks are again webs of relationships connecting people or things so networks are only as [1239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1239.9s)

strong as the connections that hold them together and and networks are fragile when those connections are weak or they're limited to kind of a narrow bridge or a single person or actor who's connecting different parts of the system together so how do we how do we cultivate trusting relationships not so that we like each other we actually don't need [1258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1258.32s)

to like each other to be able to work together and and certainly not so that we agree with each other it's actually so that we can disagree so that we can engage in conflict and the inevitable disagreements that that are going to take place when we work together if if we're actually collaborating to the best of our ability that means we're gonna have really different points of view [1279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1279.5s)

about what needs to happen and we need to be able to rather than that breaking off the the connection and we go our separate ways how do we hold attention through that disagreement until we can either find something that we do agree on and we can work together on that thing or at least have a greater openness to to understand each other's perspectives and maybe it'll change the [1300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1300.32s)

way we see things so cultivating trust then coordinating actions that's building on what's already happening having greater awareness of what's happening across the system figuring out how to share resources and where each of the different actions fits together um this is uh where it's it's so important to have an awareness of what's happening and so many of the [[impact network|impact networks]] i worked with the organizations we brought together they're aware of each other but they actually don't really know what each other is doing and and when you do as simple an exercise as sharing you know gives and gets or needs and offers and to the point where an organizational leader can say we're working on this issue or getting stuck here a request i have is x other people [1344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1344.72s)

in the room immediately in every single case they're like oh yeah you know i've i've done something like that i can share or i have someone i can connect you to or here's something i'm aware of so connecting the dots and uh we're not actually having to share resources and make decisions together but just better coordinating our efforts we're retaining autonomy in our own actions but we're [1367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1367.4s)

aware of what's happening and where we fit in and then collaborating at the systems level and that's where that collective sensemaking identifying the points of leverage that can shift the whole system is so important and then we can build structures out of that that where groups of different actors can collectively move together and share resources and [1386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1386.6s)

share decision making and collaborate to do specific pieces of work that's also where it's really helpful to to take these big issues that that [[impact network|impact networks]] or dows are often trying to to buy it off and and then break them down into more discrete parts more tightly bounded areas of focus around which we can go through the process again what's the focus and purpose here who needs to [1410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1410.12s)

be involved how do we strengthen those connections how can we coordinate our work in this area and then what can we do and what are the structures that we can build to improve our ability to actually execute on that word got it so to summarize the 5ts are clarify purpose in principles convene people cultivate trust coordinate actions and collaborating for systems change music um this feel this feel like very simple and there's a nice mnemonic of them being five c's right there but i think there's a lot of unpack with with each of these and probably a lot you learn as you iterate through doing those things over time yeah absolutely and it they are [1448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1448.88s)

simple uh in concept right but really difficult in practice and and again it's it's not like you just go through that cycle once you're actually looping through it over and over so as as we start to work together and and run experiments and learn we're gonna have a much better understanding of than how to focus and who else needs to be involved and how to connect the different actors [1472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1472.76s)

together and so forth and i think it's really important that uh dows and networks and all types of organizations kind of go through the cycle of learning experimentation and then come to a point of renewal where we we may sunset the effort we may say you know we came to the the logical conclusion and and we can sunset it and and share the learnings and and that was great uh or [1494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1494.299s)

we're shifting our folk focus in a different way a lot of networks have really gone through these important renewal stages that that completely shift the focus but it's not just trying to continue the thing into perpetuity for the sake of continuing it it's getting more and more clear about what is our focus here and what can we actually do and how can we execute on [1513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1513.799s)

that so continually revisiting each of those activities and not just considering them a linear process yeah you know it's funny it could be because you know for me as a software engineer i feel like my bias has always been around things that feel hard like [[smart contract|smart contracts]] and programming trust and if we have aligned [1536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1536.059s)

incentives then everything else will just be taken care of but i think that the more and more i get involved in in dows it it feels like there's as much connective tissue to be built at the social layer as there is like programming our values into our money and it feels like a lot of these networks have their like hard and rigid governance principles that are [1556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1556.279s)

programmed on chain or you know in a corporate charter if if if you're doing something that has a legal you know like a corporation um but it's it's really the culture and the social layer that is where a lot of the action happens and there's this there's this saying in networks that show me the incentive and i'll show you the outcome but i've seen a lot of times [1577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1577.7s)

in which the incentives are aligned and the outcome does not happen because people aren't coordinating and maybe where they're lacking trust or they don't have coordinated actions or they haven't been convened but it's been a real learning exercise for me going through the last market cycle with dallas to to to see how much of an art it is to to do this i'm curious if [1596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1596.24s)

you've seen the same yeah i think you know i would ex explore the incentives piece you know maybe it feels like they're aligned because we're talking about you know financial incentives and focusing on that but people are nuanced and they're really complex and we have a lot of different things that drive us uh it was the vast majority of the [[impact network|impact networks]] that i've been involved with didn't have any direct financial incentives but uh people kept coming back and they kept engaging and contributing their time because they got value in lots of other ways there was the social capital of course but then there's there's also the value coming back to their their personal learning the value to their organization the network actually helped [1641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1641.36s)

them get things done that they wanted to achieve and it unlocked new possibilities for them so they weren't being involved because they were getting some kind of direct financial return so by just looking at the financial incentive structure you would be wondering why people kept showing up and contributing so much time to these efforts but but i think it's because uh [1664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1664.1s)

it's not just financial incentives that drive us and sometimes those actually kind of corrupt uh the behavior of different actors and drawing the wrong wrong types of actors so i'm really curious about how we can how we can blend that that social layer that you mentioned that we've been talking about and then also the technological layer of the trustwear to to to be able to you [1685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1685.7s)

know warm really dense i trust high functioning communities but also bring on structures and mechanisms that allow us to scale beyond which we can form direct relationships with one another and and and engage many many more people and and retain the individual autonomy of actors to to be able to rage quit and uh and you know go off and and do their [1713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1713.48s)

own thing if they don't like the direction of the community as a whole so i think there's there's a really interesting blend of both that i'm looking for working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical w-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-sovereign worker focus on what they [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1733.82s)

do best their work while managing the back end for them there is a lot of nation-state overhead when working in web3 anopolis takes care of all of the back end stuff freeing you up to do what you do best obelis leverages group buying power through a community employment co helping you save twenty to fifty percent on high quality affordable health care options through cigna so do [1754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1754.64s)

goldfinch.finance to get started well you know i want to weave back into some of the concepts in [[impact network|impact networks]] but before we do that i i think that i want to pull the thread of uh the work that you're doing now because i think it maybe blends that social layer stuff and actually [[smart contract]] permissions so what are you working on now is is it in the dow space at all and uh how does it [1857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1857.48s)

help with some of these problems yeah so uh co-founder of hats protocol which is really all about how do we structure decentralized organizations to get things done how do we delegate specific roles and responsibilities and authorities to to any layer of the organization individuals teams and the organization as a whole to get things done the the the recognition here is [1880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1880.7s)

it's really flowed out of uh my experiences my co-founders experiences endows and also my experiences with [[impact network|impact networks]] and where they're what they're really good at and what they struggle with you know so many of the [[impact network|impact networks]] i've been involved with have been so good at bringing large numbers of people together to address those complex issues but then when it [1900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1900.799s)

comes down to the level of actually consistently executing to get things done they often struggle unless those responsibilities are delegated to specific individuals and a lot of times in that case the specific organizations who have the hour hypical structures to go execute on something that's in the complicated domain we've endows we've rejected hierarchies [1921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1921.64s)

for a lot of reasons the centralization of power and decision making the inequal distribution of rewards and gone to the other side of the spectrum of relative structuralistness and kind of create a tyranny of structurelessness in a lot of cases and there's they're challenged with a lack of role clarity lack of awareness of what each person is responsible for [1945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1945.799s)

where there's unnecessary duplication and where there are gaps where a new contributor could plug into and and doing a constrained delegation of responsibility and authority to empower individuals to get things done to make decisions without having to go through the consensus governance processes and a lot of times i'm seeing delegation happening in very very broad ways where [1971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1971.0s)

we're delegating decisions across all domains to a group of individuals i don't think that makes sense because people don't have the same context on each each decision or the same level of expertise on each decision we need to be able to delegate decisions and actions to individuals and teams that have high context and that are directly responsible for those and can be held [1993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=1993.32s)

accountable for those so hats protocol is a way to to delegate individual roles to to individuals and and bring it with it because we see we see roles as the basic unit of structure in an organization roles have been present throughout generations in every form of human organization but roles are not very present in dao's oddly enough and what do contributors need to to be able [2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2020.14s)

to contribute well they need any clarity around what they're signing up for what they're responsible for they need the context the information they need around that they need the associated authorities and permissions so it unlocks the the different applications and and other platforms they need to do their work and then the accountabilities which goes both ways how can the [2043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2043.899s)

collective hold the individual accountable doing what they say they're going to do and how can the individual be sure that the collective is is going to provide them with the compensation that that was agreed upon oh well the structure that doesn't have a single person at the top but the organization as a whole the dow as a whole holds the ultimate authority but we can still [2065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2065.02s)

co-create these structures to get things done when needed yeah i gotta say that um i think hats protocol is mimetically one of the best named protocols that i think i've seen out there thank you that hats hats uh i don't think we're on video but uh you know we've the hats hats have have taken off pretty well and we've wondered if we [2091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2091.96s)

should just uh be partnering with meta factory to do some interesting access control with actual hats but yeah well i just like the memetic the memetic value of oh i'm going to wear this hat and it's the same as as getting a um a roll within a dow and having that easily revocable and modular uh within different pods and dows yeah exactly and [2115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2115.78s)

just just to explain that a little more so how it works is uh what we call a hat is an 1155 nft although it's non-transferable by the wearer it's transferable by the dow itself and and so you can assign a hat at that nft with a few things you can assign it with a specific role and responsibility you can attach it to the different authorities or permissions that person would need to [2141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2141.88s)

do that work and you can connect it with different accountability mechanisms and then you can also tie to specific eligibility criteria like what uh what tokens or badges or verifiable credentials the person has in their wallet are they eligible to wear that hat or or they're eligible to wear the hat as long as they retain a you know delegation threshold above x percent by [2164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2164.2s)

a specific group of people you can embed your own custom logic and then you can also toggle the hat on enough and a really nice piece of the architecture is that each hat can then create additional sub hats underneath it so you know as we delegate specific roles and responsibilities the people wearing those hats can can further delegate and break down those roles responsibilities [2186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2186.52s)

they'll get them to other individuals to other teams and even other dows i'd really like to see uh this as a you know a mechanism for increasing actual coordination and even collaboration between different dials ecosystem instead of just within a specific organization right well yeah i mean uh the the the last of the five c's are cultivating [2208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2208.06s)

trust coordinating action and collaborating for systems change so it feels like your journey now with hats protocol is a continuation of the [[impact network]] stuff that you've done in the past yeah totally it's definitely directly evolved out of that and um it's something that you know the networks that that i've been involved in [2228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2228.579s)

would really need they need better role clarity you know again basically we can start at a high level and bring people together to to to identify specific needs and and specific things we can execute on but then when we get to that level that's where we can really add in more structure and and we can delegate more specific roles and responsibilities to go get things done ultimately people [2250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2250.42s)

are the ones who go execute on work i think we can think and plan really well in groups and teams but we need to be able to to delegate authority to to individuals and empower them to get things done well um you know i've got a couple another uh things in my notes that we could go through principles of network leadership uh different types of network leader roles [2271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2271.18s)

um the dynamic tensions that exist in [[impact network|impact networks]] are interesting to me and would love to to go down that that but you know i'm curious if there's anything that i didn't ask you that that you want to say uh you kind of choose your own adventure for the remaining 15 minutes of the episode oh man well i'd actually uh i want to hear your thoughts on a million things [2293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2293.619s)

but this is your podcast so people can already go listen to all that other stuff but uh i i think leadership is one thing that i want to touch on um and i'd love to hear your thoughts on leadership in this context as well because it's my belief that leadership always matters it matters so much it's just especially in in collaborative context it's just a really different [2314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2314.92s)

form of leadership than we see in hierarchical environments and you know i see a lot of times in in collaborative groups and even in small uh working groups people are hesitant to kind of go forward and and take take leadership and and show direction and uh and but it's it's leadership that's not directive it's it's really facilitative right it's a leadership that isn't about telling [2341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2341.98s)

people what to do but it's creating the conditions for self-organization to support people to discover what they can and want to do together and then helping keep uh things coordinated together there's there's a few different key roles of of network leaders that i've i've seen i love to get your thoughts on this one is catalyzing i've actually bringing people together for the first [2365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2365.94s)

time or catalyzing a new project or catalyzing a new conversation starting things right the second is facilitating okay so then when people are there together in space or community or team how do we actually combine these different perspectives to reach an outcome third is weaving how do we see the the structure of relationships that exist across the system and improve the [2389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2389.8s)

the webs of connections between them so that you know we reduce the points of fragility that are dependent on a really narrow bridge dependent on two people connecting different parts of the system together how do we actually notice when people could support each other's work and then go the extra mile to actually connect them together and and share that context and then fourth [2411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2411.16s)

coordination which is a lot of the back of the house kind of setting up the infrastructure providing structures that are really fit for purpose and building you know just enough structure at in order to to fit the needs not over structuring not defining rigid rules well in advance but really building the structure as we go kind of like as a garden starts to develop providing you [2437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2437.26s)

know stakes or trellises that the plants can hang on to you're not directing their path exactly but you're giving them the support they need to grow i'm curious your thoughts what are what do you see in terms of what does good leadership look like in in dows or in these types of collaborative environments yeah that's a really great question you [2455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2455.619s)

know i think you've identified a lot of dynamic tensions there and i wish that there was uh been the engineer in the wishes there was like a formula that you could just follow and and you would get there but uh you know a lot of this stuff with the dynamic tension feels like finding a middle way between different routes and and i think that that's the challenge of of web3 and in [2478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2478.119s)

you know you kind of have to accept that when you get into web three like if i was in web 2 the playbook for web 2 entrepreneurship is pretty well trotted like you just you just either get as many eyeballs as possible and sell as many ads as possible um or you have a subscription model and you uh get as many subscribers as you can you minimize the cost per uh [2501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2501.76s)

acquisition and you increase the lifetime value of each subscriber and then you sell to google for 150 million dollars or something like that it was like the web 2 model and with dallas it's it's much more of a complicated and dimensional design space and and i and i think that you know we're still trying to figure out our path forward in a dial-based world but you know one thing [2522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2522.88s)

that that i think that uh i've been diverging so maybe i'll try to converge on on uh on on one thing and and that's um from my position one area i found that i've been able to do is is try to create clarity um and especially across different domains so um you know you know like back when i was at bitcoin like i've since [2549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2549.52s)

disaffiliated from bitcoin dallas leadership and but like back when i was still at coin dial like because i was the founder i understood the engineering and the product and the marketing and and being able to create that cooperation across um across those two things i think was really really important for um like just so that they understood each other so that they could talk to each other and as long if you can drive for clarity that everyone knows the shared objectives and the mission and the considerations across uh the design space i think that that is one thing that i would love to see in more dows uh and especially you know get coined out um [[quadratic funding]] is a little bit complicated and that's what bitcoin's core product is so uh yeah i don't know it's a very end dimensional design space but that's at least one direction that you could go yeah i totally agree with that i think it so valuable to have the people who are capturing information from different parts of the system and then helping synthesize it and get that information to to where it's needed like [2613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2613.359s)

in back in uh web 2 company i was part of the knowledge management team and that was very different that was like logging the the learnings and the data and putting it into a database that nobody read really what we need is is people to go out and talk to the different working groups talk to the different parts of the system understand what's happening and then help to [2635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2635.8s)

facilitate the flow of information and and then resources so they get from the right place to the right place uh the i like to that you keep bringing up the attentions piece i think that's such a key role here is is holding tensions and and being aware of the different tensions that exist tensions like you know should we do x or y that's a clear tension but that that it's a really [2659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2659.079s)

clear choice but a lot of tensions there's no right answer right it's should we take the time to to cultivate the the community and strengthen the floater information or or should we take the time to go execute and take action that trust that that tension of building trust and taking action is so present and both are important and how do we you know uh emphasize one in in certain [2685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2685.599s)

areas and another in different areas uh tensions too around participation and pace like engaging more people uh but then that might limit us in terms of the pace of decision making uh tensions in terms of the only way that we can discover where we overlap and and what we agree on is by diverging and exploring the the many different perspectives that we have and the places [2713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2713.74s)

where we disagree and we have to hold the tension through that discomfort and and that ambiguity until things start to converge again and we can see where there's where there's some alignment we can move on that and i think it is a huge role of of leaders to to be able to hold those tensions and to be able to name those tensions when they exist just naming them and and bringing them into [2733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2733.78s)

awareness a lot of times helps people relax because we're feeling the temperature in the room rise when there's something going on we can't quite put our finger on it and when somebody names the tension that's taking place we can relax and we can start to actually thicker with through it yeah totally um and you know you would hope that in [2753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2753.88s)

an honest uh well-meaning group of people that you could sort of manage those tensions together although it's always a little bit harder in practice than it is in theory yeah it's it's not easy to to engage in in conflict or disagreement and that's where it is really valuable to you know the the cultivating trust piece is is really about like [2776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2776.98s)

it's it's so valuable to take the time to go slow initially so that we can go faster later to to build up some shared awareness of each other's perspectives uh the why that's bringing us here of our constraints uh you know what's limiting in us and and and and also our you know our personal incentives or the the people that we are accountable to and so forth [2806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2806.2s)

just understanding more about uh more about each other's context not just the the external context the things we we see and can infer about each other but the internal context what's actually going on what you're underlying uh beliefs and motivations we take it doesn't take that long but if we take some time to to be in that space first it really uh facilitates the the [2831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2831.119s)

conversations about the places where we disagree because we have a foundation of maybe not trust yet but at least goodwill or at least shared understanding uh so that we can hold in that that more challenging space of the places where we disagree and uh and so i i really encourage people to to don't jump straight into action take a little bit of time to go slow [2857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2857.92s)

initially to to build the the webs of relationships build the direct connections between people and and understanding uh the the commonalities in terms of motivations and values between people uh and because then the action that you take is going to be that much more fruitful well unfortunately uh we've got another dynamic tension uh this being a really [2879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2879.64s)

interesting design space but also a very vast one and our limited time here so i've got to start moving towards wrapping us up um david where can people find you and your work online yeah so you can find me uh on twitter at dave erlichmann d-a-v-e-h-r-l-i-c-h-m-a-n you can find the [[impact network|impact networks]] book at impactnetworks.xyz that also takes you to the converge website which is a network i started in 2013 co-founded uh to build [[impact network|impact networks]] and there you'll find the [[impact network|impact networks]] documentary and also a [[open source]] toolkit of lots of different facilitation guides and other tools that you can use that's where you found the the book images and then for hats [2925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDiBq0QO23U&t=2925.78s)

protocol you can find that at hats protocol.xyz and also on twitter at hats protocol very cool yeah we'll have those links in the show notes for easy clicking all right david thanks so much for joining me this has been great yeah i appreciate the invite foreign music
