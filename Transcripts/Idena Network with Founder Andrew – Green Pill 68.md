foreign music ation how you doing we are continuing our exploration of decentralized identity with the founder of the idina network andrew who is an anon is joining us today today to talk about their approach to doing [[sybil resistance]] so um basically idina is what they call the first proof of person blockchain and uh basically personhood is proved by [27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=27.72s)

showing up online within a strict window of time in solving a series of flip tests think of them as like kind of captchas like human intelligence tests to make it so that bots can't operate accounts this is called a validation session and if maximally successful idina helps create a more democratic borderless world we talk about quadratics taking we talk about bitcoin [46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=46.98s)

integrations we talk about why [[sybil resistance]] how we can create a more democratic web 3 with [[sybil resistance]] in this episode and then just various use cases for proof of personhood so i think this is one of the more technical episodes that we've done andrew's kind of a i would say he's like a deep technical subject matter expert if you want to go deep on [[sybil resistance]] probably a good episode for you and um if you're watching on video we have no video for this one because andrew is a non but if you're listening to audio it'll sound the same as any other podcast so a fun episode i think that [[sybil resistance]] is important uh idina is one of the many players out there making an earnest try at creating more [[sybil resistance]] and so without further ado i hope that you enjoy this episode about [[sybil resistance]] with andrew the founder of the idina network enjoy the world has woken up to refi and celo is here for it celo is the layer one for the [[regenerative finance]] movement it's fast planet positive and built for the real world celo has committed to producing a sustainable future from day one and has built its technology around [107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=107.04s)

yeah hey karen great really have been going deep on [[sybil resistance]] this season of the greenpill podcast and so really excited to talk about idina tell us about idina and how you think about [[sybil resistance]] yeah uh thanks for inviting us really appreciate that i think the [[sybil resistance]] very important topic and it's getting even more and more uh attention [228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=228.36s)

across different platform last time so uh yeah let me introduce myself first um yeah i'm under i'm a co-founder for dina i'm software engineer and before crypto i've been uh for more than 10 years in it and uh i've learned about bitcoin in 2015 and i was really amazed about bitcoin [256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=256.04s)

uh because what i learned about this is is not a digital currency it's not like a paypal but it's something new and it has no underlying asset and it's kind of a value itself which exists only on the on the web which is really kind of amazing idea and the most important part for me was that that nobody solely controls the bitcoin so it's what [[sybil resistance]] is about and in 2015 we started the semi-decentralized crypto exchange it was the first swiss-based crypto exchange in europe and uh it was a non-custodial semi-decentralized setup where you could control your money with a private key so that exchange could not get your deposited coins but at the same time you could trade [309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=309.419s)

back and forth with a speed of normal centralized exchange so what we did is we provided the premium channels for trading for users and it was a you know a building block for lighting network but we we were live even before the lightning network was launched that time and we learned a lot about the layer 2 scalability solutions and there are lots of trade-offs you [333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=333.9s)

know uh about the the about that and it's a complexity liquidity problem and ultimately all the layers to scalability techniques are kind of constrained by the limitations of the first layer of the blockchain itself and uh and that was the starting point for idina we actually decided to solve that problem so we we didn't want to make you know [362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=362.82s)

identity protocol and idea was that we just make a scalable blockchain that can perform a substantial number of transactions without decreasing the level of decentralization and actually this is kind of a you know we try to solve this scalability through now so that is that we just enabled parallel [385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=385.38s)

on chain computation which which is a sharding and instead of running one blockchain we we run just many interconnected chains and instead of running just one state machine we run multiple state machines which are secured by independent set of validators so cam how how can it you know make it securely uh we just you know [410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=410.6s)

to make it to make that possible we just needed to have as many independent validators as possible to secure every chain you know so we needed to have an excessive decentralization which is i think the key for uh solving the scalability tutorial and the silver resistant that i'm was really very very practical you know for us it was it has a really practical [439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=439.02s)

meaning for us uh but the problem was that we couldn't find you know the right basis for this decentralization what we understood that time that money doesn't work staking doesn't work because of the nature of capitals you know it's it's a wealth is getting productive distributed all the time so we we go like we reach get richer so we [460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=460.56s)

needed to find a better basis for [[sybil resistance]] which is kind of scars but you know opposite to money and the question was so what is the you know the most evenly distributed resource on the planet it's not money it's not cpus it's not electricity so what's that and the answer was it's us you know it's human beings so yeah this is how we started with this [[sybil resistance]] and yeah and you know interesting uh interesting part here is that uh because we just came up with the idea of of human beings we we try to get a better understanding of [[sybil resistance]] problem because initial definition of civil resistant attack was telling us about [516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=516.0s)

the large number of you know of pseudonymous accounts which attacker can you know create to get a disproportionately large influence on the system but satosh actually changed that definition so instead of using accounts he used cpus like to make a civil attack on proof of work you need to buy lots of cpus to make a civil attack on profile [538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=538.62s)

state system you need to buy lots of coins like for example to attack ethereum we need to have like many accounts with 32 east ethers each you know and a kind of joke you know to attack a twitter you need to to to make many accounts with you know eight bucks each which is kind of a job but is it is it going to be kind of [[sybil resistance]] resistance i think i don't think i don't think so and what we currently have in ethereum uh you know that more than 70 of the blocks are currently offer compliant which means that 70 of validators actually follow their their rules and is it okay um i don't think so and the problem is that we are as a community we just [589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=589.2s)

agreed that it's okay to have large stakeholders dominating the network if their intentions are good so if they're not interested in attacking the system because they'll lock their stakes but i think it's not okay and the reason is actually what we have in in ethereum is a civil attack i mean the [[sybil resistance]] is not about intentions you know civil attack is definition is telling us about an attacker gaining disproportion of the large influence of the system this this is what we have you see that this 70 of validators could follow the of fact rules are just a few guys and this is nothing but civil attack and we failed to handle it and we failed [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=634.56s)

the [[sybil resistance]] war already and the problem is that we accepted that and now we if you want to solve that we just need to acknowledge that problem i think we shouldn't welcome civil attackers even if their intentions are good even you know because regulators can can come in and all you know local government may account or their intentions may change [661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=661.5s)

or you know what if they can short the stake points yeah yeah so i mean i i think that we've kind of trodden the ground on greenpill of why [[sybil resistance]] matters a lot so basically moving from one token one vote dallas to more one human one boat dials creates more democracy in how tokens are distributed and how decisions are made and you know i'd be curious if you sort [689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=689.06s)

of you sort of agree with that summary if there's anything you would add to it and then i want to talk about how idina creates [[sybil resistance]] um yeah um yeah but before we just you know dive into this a um specific of ie adina i would i would uh i will try as well to tell a bit more [712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=712.82s)

about the you know uh building i didn't kind of a unique identity primitive you know because uh now you know when we started you know we we tried to find the existing solution for unique identity primitive and you know the problem was that i didn't use the blockchain and we needed to find a kind of a layer [737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=737.94s)

one identity you know a solution but you know identity identities identity data is very sensitive and it's not usually suitable for you know storing this data on blockchain because blockchain is immutable and we we try to find kind of you know privacy preserving or even better anonymous solution for that and there were many other problems like [763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=763.74s)

we needed to have the [[open source]] solution we need to have decentralized ai resistance resistant and you know non-contextual non-subjective so it should be like a global registry of validated identities and finally it should have been like we needed to find it like if a puppet resistant solution which i think was the most [784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=784.98s)

difficult and we try to iterate with many in our approaches we decided just not to go with the government-based ids because of the privacy issue you know government trust issue and we learned about biometric solutions um they're all kind of a you know there are proprietary solutions that cannot work [806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=806.399s)

with blockchain and [[open source]] solutions have their own trade-offs you know how the biometrics is analyzed either it's publicly available like you publish your you know biometrics data on chain and then we have a privacy issue or deep flex issues or it's a client-side you know analysis like you have a public neural net with some zk knowledge proof [830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=830.579s)

but then you you also have some problems with white box attacks and the address are operation attacks which are kind of um which can be applied for the neural nets so the and the last options that we we could use and that was the attendance based protocol so because other other protocols couldn't work with blockchains there are [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=857.22s)

too many trades of and we just decided to go with the um kind of a protocol that is based on you know on participation of you know users during the kind of validation ceremons so the idea is that people cannot have many accounts because they they cannot be in in many places at the same time because the time is scarce [882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=882.54s)

and we can't do the we can build it protocol around that idea and kind of make it in a way like people usually validate each other without any centralized body so initial idea you know was to run a global zoom party when you know people talk to each other at the same time we try it you know we tested that but it wasn't scalable enough and then [909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=909.72s)

we just decided to go with the validation ceremony when people were people just communicate with each other with some kind of a pre-arranged test you know and this is how we started hyena we started like building our own protocol for uh you know unique identity solution and any identity primitive right so um it seems like you wanted to [936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=936.3s)

have a [[sybil resistance]] technique that was going to be privacy preserving didn't have any pii um and and you know the zoom meetings were sort of like the prior for you we actually had brian ford on the podcast a few episodes ago and he talked about four ways to create [[sybil resistance]] biometric nation state ids uh web of [958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=958.68s)

trust and then the fourth one was presence-based and so the one that really jumps out to me with these sort of zoom parties being the the method through which you wanted to emulate with the idina protocols is presence-based you know if i'm in the presence of you at a certain time then you you can't be two people at once on that same zoom party without people catching you is [982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=982.44s)

that a fair take in a fair synopsis of what you said yeah that's right uh that's right this is what we we tried and you know and tested and and we just you know we couldn't kind of build the right protocol for zoom meetings because we need to uh you know to let people talk at the same time and uh challenge each other you know at the same time which is pretty complicated [1005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1005.899s)

yeah yeah well this feels like a great jumping off point to talk about the idea ceremony and how idina creates [[sybil resistance]] so you want to take us down that rabbit hole um i might take a bit like uh some some some more kind of details about what adina is because uh i want to and [1026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1026.839s)

emphasize that idea is not a [[sybil resistance]] solution you know it's not a identity solution it's a blockchain and it's a general purpose blockchain uh that aims to encourage running a human-centric apps on top of it uh is is based on democratic principles like one person one vote and it's not the kind of you know [[smart contract]] or it's not a fork of any existing blockchain it's it [1056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1056.419s)

was developed from scratch and it's secured by the network of nodes which run by people it's either individual or uh or family you know family notes and every person can run the validating node with equal voting power which makes again one of the most decentralized blockchains and there are around 600 nodes up and running as we speak so the core concept of the ideal protocol is a [1083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1083.419s)

unique identity and we call it crypt identity because it's somehow similar to cryptocurrency you know it has no underlying identity data it's anonymous it's global so uniqueness is not contextual and it has no central issue that could certify your uniqueness and is based on mutual verification and validation parties [1108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1108.74s)

and i think the most fascinating part about idina [[sybil resistance]] and pocket resistance is that is not just you know empowered by the crypto identity concept but it's empowered by the quadratic staking so i think the quadratic's taking is the most important part about edina because civil resistant identity itself i think uh sorry to say that but i think that [1133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1133.52s)

civil resistant identity is a myth however uh the identity primitive like unique identity primitive is a missing element for building simple resistance system and if you don't mind i just want to tell a bit more about this this provocative you know statement because um please go there yeah i think we were very idealistic when we started edina [1160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1160.22s)

we wanted to build a democratic system based on you know pure proof of personal food uh like one person one volt government system with equal mining reward distribution you know without any initial investment notes taking we wanted ideal to pay equal ubi for their validators but uh the problems that unique identity [1182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1182.419s)

is not enough for that it isn't civil resistant by itself and it doesn't matter which protocol you use for the proof of personhood either biometrics of web of trust or it's even it could be even government-based identity you know the interesting thing is that there was a really cool project it's called ubic like ubic you can google it [1209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1209.48s)

it's a kind of a proof of proof of proof of passport identity solution you can uh you know to to make your identity you just need to scan your nfc chip of your passport with your iphone you know and you you can get the zero proof of your advantage on the blockchain immediately because so cool and so simple solution and it works really well until one guy [1234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1234.86s)

from china came in and just submitted around 20 000 passport in one single batch it's really crazy i mean and the problem is that you can do the same with the you know video verification uh so people can say you some words for you on camera just for a few cents uh they can scan their faces or aries for a few cents you know they can do [1261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1261.5s)

even on a regular basis if you just pay them and this is kind of a you know evolution of fake identity arm race essentially proof of personhood is just a final stage of that iron race at the beginning we had an algorithmically based generated accounts like uh you know in the in the early stage of uh web 2. so it's more or less solved the [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1287.12s)

problem was more or less solved by captures we still use it and then the next stage was like of this arm race was just a human generated accounts where one guy could you know make hundreds of accounts per day and we currently have these human forms generating thousands of accounts 24 7 and now sitting together [1309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1309.74s)

and the hand and the third stage is a is a proof of presence for protocols uh which problem is like these protocols can be attacked with a kind of puppets you know where many people can generate just many accounts each account is kind of is linked to one person and these private accounts are valid from the from the proof of kind of personal protocol perspective but [1338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1338.9s)

they're not civil resistant you know what i mean so it's a it's not possible to prove who is exactly the owner of account and it's and it's really hard you know because usually this uh these people this kind of uh puppets they're they're not interested in kind of claiming their own uh accounts their ownership of their accounts so yeah this is this is a bad news you know for all [1364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1364.7s)

the proportion protocols that system based on unique identity are not civil resistant and i would call that a naive proof of personhood so uh the thing is that the the system that formalizes unique identity and kind of neglecting the capital create strong incentives for percussion and identity collusion it's a kind of you [1393](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1393.08s)

know a form of authoritarian systems like where you have strong leaders on the ground that can coordinate lots of people just to extract the value yeah and what we have is uh ultimately we have two extremes there on the left side on the left hand we have an authoritarian systems where money doesn't matter it's a an identity centric system and on the right side we [1424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1424.88s)

have a plutocratic systems which are token centric and on that side the identity doesn't matter and good news about that that both sides like both extremes authoritarian and plutocratic systems adjust the creams extremes located on the same dimension and we can generalize them and we can find a middle way between them you know by combining them together [1453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1453.679s)

and this is what we call quadratic staking got it yeah so tell me about quadratic staking yeah i think that quadratics taking is real gem uh we were lucky to discover that uh you know idea and i'm happy to share details about that with you um the quadratic staking is the model that [1476](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1476.0s)

actually combines proof of stake and naive proof of personhood it's a it's it's something that making you know makes your mining rewards proportional to square root of your stake so essentially it solves the plutocracy problem inherent in capitalist system [1498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1498.62s)

so it discriminates against whales or large-scale investors and at the same time it increases the weights of small users and encourage them them you know to participate more actively so uh to make uh quadratics taking a work you need to have this you know a unique identity primitive because otherwise uh large stakeholders could just split their stakes across many accounts but with the proof of personhood or kind of unique unique identity primitive you can stake the coins only if you have this kind of account validated account and you can just you know you can be slashed if you're if you [1548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1548.9s)

don't prove your liveness and at the same time if you want to withdraw your stake then you need to terminate your account so it's fully your steak is fully connected with your uh unique identity and basically your stake is always at risk you know related to your uh proof of your uniqueness of your identity and [1570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1570.2s)

which actually makes the identity primitive more [[sybil resistance]] um so yeah so on the one hand we have a quadratic staking with just it's just an improved version of uh linear staking but on the other side on the other hand it makes any unique identity itself more civil resistant and more pocket resistance so this is what we actually see currently in idina uh during last few months so before uh quadratic staking we observed a really aggressive growth of a human farms and after we released the hard fork update with the quadratic staking and what will then we we see the decrease in human forms actually human forms just who made their accounts just to extract [1621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1621.52s)

the value from the network decide to to stop their business um so yeah so this is this is what quadratic's taking andy of course quadratic stating has its own drawbacks so i i mean the main downside of the quadratic staking is its exclusivity it's an advanced version of linear staking but unfortunately [1648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1648.38s)

the monetary component of unique identity just filters you know excludes some some people and you know a fully inclusive from democratic system where every person uh has equal income and equal rights is a subject of current correction and uh i think that it's an unachievable and idealistic and it opera unfortunately so the quadratic staking is a kind of a [1678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1678.559s)

compromise between between two extremes like a capitalistic system that doesn't take into account identity and communist system that denies the role of private cargo right so i mean i i'm it seems like it's a way of talking uh of staking your tokens wherein um the amount of tokens in the voting power that you get from staking is a [1706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1706.7s)

square root of the amount of tokens so it's more democratic than a full one-to-one token system right uh one human one vote is it's not fully on that spectrum and you know my experience with [[quadratic funding]] [[quadratic voting]] uh is via get coin and one of the things we've always thought was was really powerful about [[quadratic funding]] is that it gives the people with more capital more of a [1732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1732.08s)

voice and an incentive to give more of their capital but it doesn't give them one-to-one it gives them a square root like a decaying uh more influence for putting in more capital which is a way of waiting the whole system on some towards the poor the many over the rich and the few but still giving the rich people an incentive to participate do you see any sort of symmetries between [1751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1751.52s)

quadratic staking and [[quadratic funding]] there yeah absolutely actually uh the quadratic uh staking idea was fully inherent from uh glen whale ideas about writing voting and and [[quadratic funding]] proposed by vitalik and yeah and i i mean it's very important uh concept and the more projects follow this concept the the [1778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1778.82s)

more civil resistant the holocaust systems can be you know because otherwise if you just you know consider the identities like like now identities without stakes like uh like equal then you automatically create a pressure you know and incentives for the italian guys who can you know coordinate people on ground and just create you know puppets so we need to [1808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1808.34s)

use this approach you know widely across mining projects it's very important working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical w-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work while managing the back end for them there is a lot of nation state [1832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1832.34s)

uscc to work empowering real businesses growth join goldfinch's new member vaults to be an active investor and take part in supporting goldfinch's security and expansion receive yield enhancements generated by protocol revenue plus access exclusive communication channels and more so go to goldfinch.finance to get started um well you know i'd love to get into [1932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1932.899s)

the actual idana ceremony at some point point does that make sense to steer the conversation there is there anything else you wanted to say before before we get into that oh sure um and this is fun for me because i participated in an id in a ceremony uh i think it was about a year ago uh could you tell us about about how idina actually verifies the humans [1952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1952.1s)

yes uh the idina protocol uh as i as i said let's see attendance uh based protocol so there is no qyc no way metrics so the protocol is based on regular validation ceremony where you need to prove your aliveness and uniqueness by participating in that and it's based on an idea that you cannot be in many places at the same [1977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=1977.419s)

time so all participants appear online at the same time across the world and prove their personhood by solving so-called flip tests flip tests is a kind of a captcha but it's a it's it's they made by other participants which makes them more ai resistant and flip is abbreviation it stands for filter of life intelligent people it's a [2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2005.08s)

it's a binary test uh so we need to solve a bunch of these tests you know to prove your personhood and and there are two sides of these tests like two answers uh they they looks like like a comics you know there are sequences of images that tell you a story without using any text texts it's like a it's language agnostic so every flip has two has two versions of the [2032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2032.679s)

story one is correct and one is shuffled and to complete complete this test you need just to identify which story makes more sense for for for the majority of other people who also solve this test so um solving this flip test is pretty simple it's not an iq test but it's even kids can do you know these tests uh even if you get difficult difficult flip during the ceremony where you cannot [2062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2062.32s)

identify the right answer it's most likely will be disqualified by uh by the consensus because other people who also cannot solve this flip they will vote randomly and will not be able you know the committee will not be able to reach the consensus about the right answer and the flip will be disqualified and the author of this clip flip will be kind of uh the the author will just lose some rewards and because of that uh so yeah this is pretty much uh it about the the ceremony and we have this ceremony like on a regular basis and the uh the epic duration depends on the network size the the larger the network the less frequently ceremony um take place so uh and yeah um this [2116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2116.02s)

much this is pretty much um um about the the ceremony itself so let me know if it makes sense yeah well i remember participating in the ceremony and this might have been last summer that i participated in one but i if i recall it was a um it was every two weeks the ceremonies were happening back then does that seem [2139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2139.42s)

like the right time interval yeah that's right it's uh it was uh two weeks it's it's as i said it's a function of the network size and it's always like happens at the same time and you know it's it happens like um early in the morning for the uh for the america and late at night for the uh for the asia and it's like they it's [2167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2167.2s)

like one 1 30 p.m utc time which is the date you know for your opinions yeah and i recall um basically getting online and then opening up i think it was an ideena website or it might have been an application and then for 10 or 15 or 20 minutes i can't recall solving a series of these flips and i remember thinking [2189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2189.7s)

that they do kind of feel like captchas in a way and i i know that i passed the ceremony and i was part of the uh the registry for a little while after that which was cool i can't remember if i got any tokens for doing it but um but yeah um go ahead yeah uh actually uh yeah the thing is [2210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2210.28s)

that the identity is not forever so it just lasts for until the next validation so if you're if you you can you can actually miss up to two validations in a row and then your identity got terminated and uh once you get verified once you get validated with this ceremony you can run your node and you know get some kind of [2234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2234.06s)

coins for that and the validation itself can be run both on um on you know desktop version of the uh adding up or we recently developed maybe it was like a year ago we we just deployed the web version so it's available on the browser so you can just connect to any shared node that provide now by provided by the community and and you can't even run it on your [2264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2264.16s)

mobile you know which is really nice so you can do the validations um wherever you are yeah well you know the one thing i did after i went through the ceremony was i went on to the get coin website and i verified my identity uh on bitcoin so i could get more matching so it was neat to see get coin and idina interoperate [2285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2285.82s)

in in that way yeah that's true actually uh now we have uh the gitcoin passport right uh and uh uh we we actually submitted the pull request uh to get that integration with the bitcoin passport as well nice yeah cool um well you know um i i'm curious if [2314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2314.32s)

there's anything anything i didn't ask that you want to say uh about idina um i i think that uh you know i i think it's really neat to see a bunch of different pluralistic ways of creating more [[sybil resistance]] uh uh work together and and build this ecosystem so i'm curious if there's anything that that i didn't ask that you want to say uh probably i would i would like to explain a bit about uh our anonymity i think it's a very important part of you know idea project right and i have first of all i wanted to say thank you kevin for inviting us even um regardless on our annuity and it's it's also it's it's the first time we speak in public that way and um uh actually we committed to stay on the animals inspired by satoshi and as well as in bitcoin we didn't make any ico so the project is fully [[open source]] and anyone can follow and contribute and the main reason why we stay anonymous is uh we wanted to minimize our influence on the protocol so we want the community to decide about the protocol values [2389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2389.44s)

and i think it's very important the feeling when community members just now feel in charge of protocol changes you know we are as a team we cannot make any simple changes in a protocol so we cannot deploy any hard work without community support because the validators who control the network and users who uses who use the system are the same [2416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2416.74s)

people so we are very thankful to our community for their activity and involvement into the protocol governance and i want to say a special thanks to all our old guys i want to say that we hear you we do our best to follow your discussions and read your comments and thank you for staying out with us for such a long time really appreciate [2443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2443.5s)

that and i will really share your passion about building democracy and sustainable [[sybil resistance]] yeah well you know i do think that there's there's really an important i don't want to say trade-off but i want to say a design criteria of creating actual [[sybil resistance]] but still protecting privacy i think that [2466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2466.0s)

yeah that's a really important thing to that you just can't bolt on at at the end and of the uh of the the mechanisms that brian ford told us about presence-based biometric kyc and web of trust it feels like there's a lot of in that trade-off space privacy concerns that i really have concerns about with kyc and biometrics and i think relying totally on [2491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2491.92s)

presence-based um in web of trust is a really elegant way of creating more [[sybil resistance]] but but also maintaining privacy and y'all y'all are uh it seems like y'all are doing it and the fact that you're in on yourself as the founder i i think is uh um is an interesting fact pattern that that supports the privacy at the base [2511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2511.0s)

layer so um yeah i mean is there anything else is there any other sort of important design criteria that you want to tell us about um yeah i would i would also uh like to tell a bit about the use cases of uh human-centric blockchains in general you know yeah because there are some that are really on the surface surface but uh um like you know like votings dollars [2539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2539.079s)

air drops quadratic road in [[quadratic funding]] you know ubis and actually now we have quadratic staking and we have idina as the uh as a blockchain is also the use case for uh for unique identity primitive but we also have many things to discover and i would like to name a few of them or for example let's see on chain ads [2568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2568.02s)

uh you know we do experiment with that and nobody likes us but on chain as is a different concept and it's something that you know you just publish on chain and anyone anybody can you know pull that out and just view that ads and we build it kind of free the protocol based on self-targeted ads you know so um and i think it's a huge market you [2596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2596.619s)

know that still doesn't exist on chain which is a really really interesting and it can only work with the uh unique identity primitive then interesting uh idea is about the content moderation uh this also we we do some experiments with that we use randomly selected human oracles for the arts moderation and um probably another version of that we could experiment with the uh you know fake news analysis like it's it's a subject to explore but yeah probably could make some experiments with that yeah and is there an ecosystem of people that are building these type of things on on top of adina tell me about the community yeah we already have a you know [2647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2647.44s)

uh building uh into the clients uh the oracle voting system so if you're validated uh identity then you just can participate in the oracle votings you can run your own votings you know and it's a kind of civil resistant warnings uh were you can do you know different things like you can ask you know participant to stake something you know before they [2675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2675.339s)

vote before they publish their role uh and yeah so and or you can just pay for for some you know polls asking their opinions um so yeah all this stuff is already there so we we run you can even you know lock some coins you know based and and unlock the coins based on oracles uh decision which are you know so that oracles are just randomly [2703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2703.24s)

selected from the network and they can decide you know whether to unlock the coins or just make keep them locked this is actually the the interesting primitive that we we uh anticipate you know to use uh in order to implement a kind of decentralized gitcoin you know so decentralized common good finding platform we actually have a [2727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2727.119s)

so-called zero wallet in arduino protocol where portion of inflation is getting locked and it's really big challenge how to you know how to spend that coin safely and yeah this is um um kind of a subject that you know we need to explore and experiment with and community you know [2754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2754.359s)

does a really interesting experiments with that running um community multi-seek like a community wallet and yeah hopefully we'll manage to build some kind of an automation like a decentralized in all [[smart contract|smart contracts]] to that could be able you know to fund projects driven by the randomly selected [2776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2776.38s)

oracles great well um this has been a really fun episode learning about your take on [[sybil resistance]] is there anything that i didn't ask that you want to say from here uh i think it's pretty much it so um what i what i just wanted to add that we truly believe that human sensory [2802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2802.119s)

blockchain can make our lives better we just need to find the right way to build the you know identity which should be i think civil resistant pipet resistant and privacy preserving and i hope it could lead us to a better world which is more connected less polarized and more democratic and we are staying in the dangerous fork on the roads you know so [2828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c&t=2828.579s)

let's pick the right way to stay safe and coordinated very cool yeah um well i guess let's wrap by by uh by asking where can where can people find idina online um it's a website uh id in a um idena dot io so and you can find all the [[social media]] out there great well thanks so much for joining me on this episode of greenpill really enjoyed the conversation and see you out there on the civil resistant future music
