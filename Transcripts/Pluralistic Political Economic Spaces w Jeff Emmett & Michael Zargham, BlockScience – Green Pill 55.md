foreign music what's up guys how's it going thanks for having us yeah very glad to have you so uh i think that block science is at the intersection of a lot of greenpill stuff a lot of the stuff that we did at gitcoin involved block science and let's just let's just tee off with with what is block science and what do you [24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=24.6s)

all do i guess i'll start so uh block science is a an engineering design like an analysis sort of an r d company um the cool thing about it is that we've grown it up pretty organically based on what money we were able to make by providing design and analysis services and through its growth we've focused on building it in a cooperative way so [45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=45.84s)

although it's initially formed as a c-corp structure we're actively evolving towards a more participatory governance mechanism and and even eventually legal structure changes foreign and maybe just to build on that a lot of what block science does is um complex engineering design analysis and and so on so a lot of web3 enabled [68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=68.22s)

systems um token ecosystems are sort of complex adaptive systems that evolve over time um so while our our work doesn't um exclusively exist in the web 3 space i think that's a really interesting new application for complex engineering and and how we can design more robust resilience systems over time the complex [90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=90.78s)

systems will terminology is sort of proliferating and getting very popular but it's often not something people really understand beyond a buzzword generally complexity relates to things being greater than the sum of their parts not being able to necessarily understand them from a single perspective or by just breaking systems down into their constituent elements and [112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=112.02s)

understanding the elements so one of the ways that block science has sort of developed this complex systems expertise is by drawing on a lot of different fields so our sort of core senior engineering team includes danilo who's an atmospheric physicist jean sheed who's a computational economist david sisson who did his phd in neuroscience but then did a whole career as a [136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=136.14s)

software architect um and this sort of breath of experience is really plays into it actually not to leave out matt barlin who's a a naval architect by formal training who also worked on sort of cad softwares for ship holes and like global scale logistics systems so like these people have these experiences that are all different but they have certain commonalities in the [159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=159.239s)

way that we understand these big hairy sort of complex ecosystems cool so um you know the reason i well there's many reasons that i wanted to have you on the pod but one of the primary ones is uh if we're going to re if we're going to build regenerative crypto economics if we're going to build a more regenerative digital frontier we're [179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=179.58s)

going to have to work with complex adaptive systems that evolve over time and a problem well understood is half solved uh insofar as you can understand it so let's break that down complex adaptive systems that evolve over time complexity just means it's hard to understand them and you have to break them down into your elements uh into their elements and draw on a lot of [199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=199.08s)

different diverse fields in order to solve them uh that's complexity adaptive means that it evolves over time or that it adapts over time i guess could you break down the field or or sort of like the problem set of sure adaptive systems so they adapt over time is tricky because it generally means that we have multiple scales of adaptation so there are sort of things that have a let's say [224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=224.22s)

a highly automated very data operation like a protocol that says if you do this that happens that's like an immediate kind of constant time scale but then there's other time scales like maybe there's daily cadences or monthly cadences or even year over year cadences that represent how that system changes for example uh governance versus operations so like you have like a [247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=247.319s)

policy making decision in a dao that might change the way a particular um i don't know contribution is measured or rewarded but that's different from saying hey we're actually fundamentally amending the kind of uh stuff we do or how we go about doing what we do which is more governance oriented and then even beyond that you might have the emergence of new organizations or [270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=270.06s)

relationships between organizations which is like where the da dao stuff comes in and so you get these like um temporal and spatial scales that are spread out over um and in particular over time here where you don't want to muddle together things that are fast you know instantaneous or day-to-day with things that are better understood as um sort of longer term incredible where [293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=293.82s)

else could we go in understanding this domain uh for the for the time adaptation domain i've been putting a lot of effort into understanding uh like constitutional principles been working with a guy named eric alston who's actually also uh there in boulder and exploring um the way that constitutional forms [316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=316.44s)

create space for activities and so again day-to-day activities happen within the um within the rules or the constraints that are set by these constitutional paradigms and that but the constitutional structures are also themselves often amendable on a much slower time scale with a lot of friction so that research has also crossed paths with um primavera de felipe and is also [341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=341.22s)

i've done quite a bit of writing with kelsey navin on the subjects of um sort of dao's as these kind of again complex adaptive systems but with an emphasis on how they change over time um i don't know jeff do you have uh thoughts yeah i was just going to point to sort of cyber physical systems in general um so cyber physical systems design is [364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=364.02s)

any um technological and social innovation like so um international power grids for example so power grids are always load balanced which is tricky from an engineering perspective because you need to make sure that the amount of power being produced is roughly equivalent to the amount of power being used but then you [382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=382.02s)

introduce of course people plugging in stuff unplugging stuff they're responding to different incentives in the network maybe those are pricing incentives where it's cheaper to use when energy is more available and more expensive to use when energy is less available so you have all this sort of adaptive dynamic complexity in real world systems and we just are basically [401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=401.52s)

using those same you know control theoretic tools and um you know load balancing and all of that sort of graceful failure etc etc from real world cyber physical systems and bringing them into you know the the economic design layer how can we design cyber physical commons um is you know one one area of interest that we're that we're researching currently [424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=424.44s)

hmm i think what's interesting oh go ahead zargum i was gonna say that uh those cyber physical systems um these sort of public um public infrastructures are essentially a kind of man-made [[public good]] and so when we start to look at our physical infrastructures that we rely in rely on whether there are power grids or our transportation networks or our our [448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=448.02s)

inter our isp networks which also involve quite a lot of cables being laid and sort of maintained in order to provide you the experience of the internet we're already looking at places where where something is you know maybe not quite a [[public good]] in so far as you know you do have to say pay for um the isp the internet service you do have some rivalrousness in the sense [471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=471.479s)

that the the is a capacity constraint on on those infrastructures so um we might need a different notion from quote [[public good]] because of the rivalrousness um and the potential excludability but nonetheless we have this concept of um communal resources that we produce and maintain and all share and so i actually think that this kind of mental model [496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=496.259s)

around these infrastructures is a really good one for reasoning about all sorts of other digital infrastructures that we are co-producing with the caveat that some of these digital infrastructures have even less rivalrousness though to be fair block space is essentially the rival horse resource of of the ethereum mainnet working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but [521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=521.58s)

real business growth worldwide at goldfinch.finance and it feels like there's so many directions we could go one question that came to mind for me uh when you were talking about cipher physical systems jeff was the idea of like hardness of physical constraints uh kind of closes the design space of complex adaptive systems that evolve over time from being [648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=648.42s)

so many different dimensions and it collapses the design space by adding constraints at the front which maybe shrinks the design space a little bit and i'm wondering if the if there's an analog there with what you said zargum about constitutions like if you add a set of rules at the foundation of the system it constrains the design space and allows you to explore it faster is [667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=667.019s)

there a synergy between like the hardness that comes from atoms and the hardness that comes from constitutional forms yes yeah i would say that there is it's not perfect but we're creating environments where we're imposing uh what we often will call laws of motion on these systems and in fact from a methodological perspective some of the best ways to get reliable properties is [688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=688.98s)

to use energy functions so in much of our mechanism design in order to actually get to composable mechanisms that preserve their properties and i'm again i'm going to emphasize the composability right because in web3 we're constantly building systems that we can not we cannot guarantee that we understand how they will be used in the future because they're constantly being [709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=709.86s)

composed with each other and the physical world properties that make composability work are basically energy functions the the fact that if you have a system that preserves a particularly energy function like relationship in its laws of motion then it doesn't matter how you use that system what you combine with it you can't break its internal energy rules and so we use a lot of that [731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=731.82s)

analogy in order to start to to both design like establish requirements as well as verify those requirements and as you say sort of shrink the design space by asserting rules but the part of the way that we make sure that those rules stand up to composition is with um with custom notions of of energy for specific systems yeah and i really like the idea of you [757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=757.62s)

know the quadratic lands because it really gives an idea of like a space and really what we're doing when we design these economies is we're designing new economic spaces and if we don't design the conservation rules properly someone can just come in and and kick it and break everything you know imagine designing a skyscraper if the the force of gravity changed every [778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=778.26s)

10 minutes you know it wouldn't be possible um so in in that sense these constraints making something um you know reducing the dimensionality is a way that we can get stability in these systems and i think that's a really interesting sort of paradox that the constraint is actually what sets you free cool just wanted to add for the listeners uh the quadratic lands is this mythical land that uh was it mimetically invented at bitcoin but it's basically a world in which you've rewritten the laws of economics to favor the commons and to make sure that common goals in court uh are fulfilled and there's maximum coordination and get coins token distribution event uh the actual name of [817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=817.32s)

the website was quadratic lands where you could get your gtc tokens so that's the memetic uh call out that you were making with quadratic lands go ahead z yeah i'm just i'm thinking about the the infrastructure analogies and some of our discussions here and i think another concept that might be really helpful is differentiating between a system's properties and its implementation so [840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=840.18s)

humans like actual everyday humans interacting in spaces care very little about the mechanisms that gave rise to the properties that they experience i like to use analogies of you know plugging your phone into the wall you don't think much about the grid hopping in your car are and driving you know with your kids to your to your parents house to visit you don't think much [864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=864.24s)

about the transportation system you know you hot you log in and your computer is connected to the internet and you really don't think much about your isp and there's a lot of technical depth to the the production and maintenance and even coordination that gives rise to these network systems and yet um the properties that humans care about are their relative reliability stability [885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=885.36s)

maybe fairness a sort of you know to highlight the things like the net neutrality discussion but but ultimately these are not characteristics of the implementation their their properties of the complex potentially adaptive system and that you want those properties to be reliable so a big part of what we try to do is apply historical engineering methodologies to distinguish between the [910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=910.56s)

the implementation and the properties and to make the properties desirable and and actually really stable reliable even if the implementations themselves end up varying over time or need operations or governance to keep the properties of health i would love to add a constraint to this conversation and that is uh i'm gonna do that in the form of asking a question [940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=940.139s)

which is um actually applying some of this and and the way i want to do that is through storytelling uh in [[gitcoin grants]] round seven i came to you guys i was like help we're being civil attacked [[quadratic funding]] optimizes for the number of people who fund a get coin grant or a clr fund grant or a giveth grant and the number of people instead of the amount [962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=962.339s)

they they fund and because of that there's a crypto economic incentive to make up new identities and that's what's called a civil attack problem and so i came to block science and i was like hey i have this complex system and i don't want the bad guys to get the matching pool money help um and and and so you know tell us about the the work that you designed there [981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=981.42s)

tell us what you think about civil resistant and uh i'm adding this constraint to to bring the design space into a more tangible place that hopefully people can understand through storytelling so uh who wants to take a swing at it i i'll start and then i'll pass it off to jeff but first thing is you know civil attacks are [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1000.92s)

um obviously like common in the internet in a world where pseudonymity is the basic notion of identity so you can have many identities by default and it's only in constrained spaces that's your sort of forced or bottlenecked down to have a single identity um and so it's not it wasn't really an intrinsic issue until you combined it [1021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1021.74s)

with a mechanism that really expects a unique identity so [[quadratic funding]] is based on a a resource allocation principle that makes in its implicit assumption of unique identity so once we had a look at the data and we found that there was this massive proliferation of what looked like bot behavior we had to come up with a kind of classifier a way of saying that one looks fake that one [1051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1051.74s)

looks real um with keeping in mind that this particular class of decision making algorithm falls into uh something not unlike a a court system like a guilt he not guilty where we don't actually know the ground truth so our decision ends up being the thing that it gets operationalized so the big part of what block science did on the first pass was [1074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1074.24s)

really try to examine the data and talk to people different projects working on [[sybil resistance]] like the bright id team did some analysis as well and in the course of our discussions with them we started to scope out what it would mean to build machine learning algorithms that acted in complement with human reviewers to try to assign labels of sybil not civil to the activity on the [1100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1100.28s)

get coin platform in order to sort of mitigate the risk of funds from the matching pool flowing to attackers disproportionately and so um we can we can talk more about what specifically we did but the problem framing exercise like to figure out okay kevin called us up and said oh we've got this issue what do we do you know we have to then start by by trying [1123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1123.2s)

to understand it before we start trying to solve it and i think just just to complexify the problem a little bit more i think i also came to you after the [[sybil resistance]] conversation i was like oh there's also collusion attacks where people will sell their legitimate identities uh just to to make it a little bit harder on top of the civil problem jeff [1141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1141.799s)

jeff do you want to take a swing of this yeah definitely well actually i just wanted to you know give some kudos and praise to the the get coin passport and i think there's a really interesting because you know what what ended up coming out of all of this was um sort of a composite of a bunch of different identity systems and you know with the uh for anyone who doesn't know [1161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1161.96s)

how that worked it was you know essentially you could attest or or prove your identity on bright id ideena network um you know there are a number of different identity networks and you could get essentially a bonus multiplier on your um uh donations based on how many platforms you were verified on [1181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1181.94s)

um and i think this is a really interesting way that we can compose different um web3 primitives because each of those identity networks probably you know thought they were solving the problem all on their own but what you find oftentimes is that they're sort of solving for one um perspective on that or one one [1199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1199.34s)

ecosystem so i really like the the get coin um product that ended up coming out of this is sort of a a measurement of a bunch of different identity networks to create an even stronger um simple identity or symbol um uh prevention mechanism and then turn that around and offer that as a product to the larger web 3 ecosystem i think that [1220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1220.16s)

speaks beautifully of the composability and the the power of these um i would say that identity is one of the hardest places to deal with composition right because just think about some specific cases i could use bright id on one hand and like twitter and github and a few other things on another hand to create two distinct identities that are [1243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1243.08s)

partially supported by the by tools being used for identity and in the process you could get some degree of sibling though i'll grant you it's bounded because you're limited by um sort of the number of platforms that are respected within the system but the thing about the passport that i think is important for people to understand is [1264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1264.02s)

that there's a very big difference between a passport and say stamps in your passport or attestations within your passport and so you're not actually alleviating the need for sort of trustworthy and i'll call them institutions even if those institutions are themselves you know dows or you know algorithms maintained by groups of people um again i'm going to use bright id as my favorite example um sort of bright id is a thing that you could come to trust as bright id and insofar as you trust it then it would be meaningful for you to see that in your gitcoin passport and the same for any other attestation mechanism that has been integrated or composed into the passport system so in [1306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1306.98s)

a way creating a nice standardized api so to speak a place or data structure that you could go to look for those attestations and know how to read them have a reasonable expectation about how to interpret them is actually really critical as a sort of data source for people who are building any sort of protocol that requires a stronger notion of identity but your particular decision [1329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1329.419s)

about how that data will be used in your app is still in your own policy space as the dap developer that's using something like the get coin passport i hope that's helpful for clarification because i think often we get can you know we can get muddled up between the difference between the technical mechanisms and the social mechanisms that are used to underpin identity in digital spaces [1354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1354.5s)

uh one area where i'd love to go is that you know while [[sybil resistance]] is an important money lego for the ecosystem and one human one vote dowels are better in some ways than more plutocratic dials um maybe one human one vote dials aren't the ultimate final destination of what happens once we have [[sybil resistance]] i'm wondering you know jeff what you think of that [1375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1375.559s)

yeah definitely and i i see this a lot in the web 3 ecosystem that you know there's a spectrum definitely um from you know one human one vote on one side and one token one vote on the other and there's all sorts of sort of interesting space in the middle and i think [[quadratic voting]] strikes an interesting balance between uh those those polls um but i mean it's a bit of a contrary [1396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1396.799s)

opinion but i don't think one person one vote is the epitome of democracy that that we treat it like in in the world today and actually i don't think there are many society many many decisions uh that are you know society faces where everyone should have the same decision-making power and i don't mean we should disenfranchise anybody absolutely not um but the interesting [1418](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1418.4s)

thing with tokens is well one we move away from this binary yes no um you know when we vote in representative democracy systems essentially we put a one and a couple of zeros into the system um our societal signal processing system we do that once every four years you know my nintendo has better signal throughput than that so in terms of and [1438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1438.5s)

also intensity of preference you know we can only say we want this we don't want this we can't say how much or how much we want it or how much we don't want it so we lose a lot of in terms of signal processing you you have a much richer space of decision making of of collective sentiment aggregation when you give people the ability to say i'm partly for this i'm holy for this i'm [1460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1460.28s)

wholly against this it's a much richer signal space and it could allow for far more sort of [[collective intelligence]] processing over just yes no um decision making if the governance design space is something that dows are really opening up but we're still very focused on the procedures also so much of what you're describing can also take place in say [1483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1483.32s)

deliberative processes and or less formal constructions so we're seeing uh on an undling of governance mechanisms and then giving people sort of our communities sort of a la carte primitives to combine together to create their own [[collective intelligence]] and um for better or worse i think some things work together well and other things clash a little bit so [1508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1508.76s)

um the interesting thing that's going on right now is you see organizations configuring differently and then discovering how things work and then adjusting their internal decision making rules according to what they learned from trying to apply them um and jeff i think one of the things that i like the most about your point about one person one vote is the the [1530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1530.96s)

comments about you know only being able to say yes or no i think that there's so much room for both expressing intensity of preference and also just expressing new things that aren't easily put on a docket so having more openness about how things get onto it onto the list of things to be considered by the group how they get curated down to the things that are actively being considered because in [1556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1556.1s)

much of our existing political process those processes are very hard to get involved in in a meaningful way and as a result most people only ever experience you know a choice that they want neither of and getting to a place where people are more enthusiastic about at least some of the choices put in front of them is a is a really good goal and that we can start by making this the case in our [1579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1579.32s)

devs yeah i i think there's really a much larger space for participatory democracy using these kinds of emergent or bottom-up um signaling systems that are enabled by tokens um that we that we just don't really like it's not really in our collective imagination because we're used to [1597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1597.559s)

representative democracy um and i forget what i was reading recently but basically that like this is not democracy at all because we have almost no decision right before the vote um even after the vote you know maybe i voted for a politician who promised electoral reform um and then didn't deliver it three months later and now i'm stuck with them [1617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1617.24s)

for four years um you know even though they they didn't do what they said they would do so i think it's a really interesting new mechanisms to enable more um adaptiveness and responsiveness in terms of our our political systems and and how we make decisions collectively democracy in the context of complex adaptive systems is more about having [1636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1636.62s)

meaningful feedback loops between the governed and the process that governs them and i think one of the biggest challenges is that we start putting the procedures or the rules in the role of hey as long as we follow this democratic process we're democratic and if the lived experience of the participants is not one of having again a meaningful feedback loop upon the system that [1660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1660.32s)

governs them then i would be hard-pressed to call that democracy the interesting thing is the separation between the property and the lived experience of the constituent versus the um the definition or the declaration of the mechanism and although crypto gives us a lot of mechanistic design space it's ultimately not about the mechanisms themselves it's about using them to [1683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1683.299s)

create uh sort of a member experience that is truly enfranchising you know it reminds me a little bit of this famous quote about political philosophy that the consent of the governed is only the only basis for legitimacy of the actions of governments so as opposed to like the divine right of king where your moral right to rule comes from above comes from god the [1704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1704.48s)

consent of the govern kind of creates that closed loop where you can hopefully if you're doing it well create procedures and rules that create a container in which the lived experience of having that feedback from the people you're you're governing actually happens so uh yeah that that piece of political philosophy is super relevant but i would go so far [1728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1728.9s)

as to say it's about half of the equation you need the consent of the governed in so far as people feel uh that they're meaningfully being heard and that they're they have again that they're enfranchised in these processes but anyone who's tried to design something by committee also knows that you know a consensus decision doesn't lead to a good outcome necessarily and [1749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1749.84s)

so the tension is between the like legitimacy from the perspective of fulfilling purpose so say we all agree on the purpose of this collective this organization and we see the outcome individually and we form our own opinions about whether it is succeeding relative to our interpretation of the purpose of that system that that is the thing that's sometimes in tension with [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1773.539s)

the then the individual capacity to influence the direction it's moving so the kinds of [[collective intelligence]] and democratic processes that we are striving for in these regenerative economies are ones that are capable of holding the tension between individual participation and capacity to influence the direction of the system with the um potentially individual and sort of [1797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1797.299s)

group level assessment of whether um the system is actually fulfilling its intended purpose or succeeding in its goal of so care maintenance regeneration etc and again a lot of emphasis on the fact that there isn't going to be one absolute right answer in part because we have to hold this tension between the the community of contributors and or parties affected by the decisions and [1821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1821.779s)

the process of making and evaluating decisions from the perspective of some some potentially concrete and in other cases some somewhat nebulous goals i mean if i ask what it would mean to regenerate the planet we'd be hard-pressed to put a single number on it but on the other hand we could come up with whole batteries of metrics which we feel strongly are individually [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1843.26s)

correlated with what we mean by regeneration and i think that some of the the beauty of these tools as well is that we don't have to compress everything into one metric which is part of the problem today where we try to compress everything into dollars you know what is the what is the ultimate baseline cost or what is the bottom line and when we [1862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1862.94s)

flatten all of that um we miss a lot of the equation or i mean we miss or we purposefully leave out um you know and these are externalities um and when we try to flatten something too much we lose out on the on the rich additional dimensions and i think there's a lot of space to play in these in these higher dimensions but we just [1882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1882.74s)

kind of miss that when we try to collapse it all into this one economic substrate of the the dollar economy um so i think having tokens to represent multiple different forms of value um and i mean you know simplistically carbon credits you know to monitor carbon accounting this is one of the you know big directions the web three space has gone likely because [1904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1904.399s)

there's already this sort of institutional design space around carbon credits existing in the real world but we could do that for any number of metrics um ecological social um you know and there could be just so much uh larger proliferation of understanding the value in various different dimensions without having to [1921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1921.98s)

lose that richness by collapsing to something too flat i mean it feels like pluralism is maybe something that bakes into the base layer here where you're not going to just have one economic system you're going to have a plurality of economic system that supports different levels of infrastructure the us dollar which is you know the what commodities will be [1940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1940.159s)

traded in ethereum which is the index of the uh web3 ecosystem and then the d-apps and dowels that all represent their own little sub local economies and that's the web3 version of this but like you can almost imagine there being localities like physical localities with their own their own value systems also so i know is pluralism something at the base layer [1961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1961.22s)

you think of these things i view it as as pretty fundamental as a concept um i've been uh the way that this manifests in practice for me is biodiversity of political economic forms and so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean just like oh everything's great like in the sense that every design is good but it means that there are many different species [1986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=1986.96s)

that are all individually viable and capable of entering into symbiotic or ecosystemic relationships with each other so yeah in a way you could interpret that as saying that a monoculture or a monopolitical economy is actually less robust less healthy and less regenerative than one that is fundamentally pluralistic because it's the the pluralism concept that sort of [2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2011.559s)

encodes this idea that a healthy economy or a healthy political economy is one with a high degree of institutional biodiversity coin shift is a leading treasury management an infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses that need to manage their treasury operations every crypto organs to manage this treasury and coinshift offers a simple flexible and efficient [2032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2032.32s)

to connect some dots here and i'd love to get your reaction uh get coin well greenpill is all about creating more regenerative digital frontier it get coin we memed this idea of the quadratic lands into the the ether pun intended and the idea was a world in which we've rewritten the laws of economic gravity to support the commons and to support collective [2151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2151.24s)

resource allocation and the way that you do that is with mechanism design that harnesses [[collective intelligence]] that is legitimate because it has a feedback loop of the people that it's governed um and also is more effective at allocating resources because it's [[collective intelligence]] but there's not going to be one [[collective intelligence]] we're going to have a pluralism uh [2170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2170.14s)

biodiversity of political economic forums that is going to make up the gestalt of maybe the like the vessel to vessel to the quadratic lands just to like land back where i started which is you know building more regenerative digital frontier i mean is the quadratic lands it sounds like it doesn't just have one infrastructure or like vessel to get there it's got many vessels and [2191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2191.8s)

it's the plurality of them is is how we make sure that we make it there yeah i would say that i view the quadratic lands as we've articulated it as a much higher dimensional space so to kind of imagine that the economics that we live in today as a kind of flat land than the quadratic lands is higher dimensional and in that higher dimensional space there are lots of [2213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2213.579s)

different kinds of value some which might not be commoditizable so things that are not transferable or sort of locally defined at an individual level or a relationship level or at an entity level but like even going beyond that i think it's important to remember that [[collective intelligence]] isn't a magic wand you don't just like feed a bunch of information into a pot stir it around [2235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2235.0s)

and it spits out good decisions in practice the biological forms of [[collective intelligence]] have very specific sort of protocols or laws of motion or information systems underpinning them and that when we if you were to hijack or manipulate those just a little bit they the coordination breaks down so if there is one thing that i would want people to take away [2257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2257.56s)

from this conversation it's that it's not just about sort of coordination at the level of hey we coordinated so it's going to work great it's actually about the specific coordination mechanisms and their fitness to the specific problem at hand and the plurality comes in because there's a whole lot of different problems happening concurrently and so you need to be able to find solutions [2282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2282.28s)

that make sense in context and that they're capable of sharing some some space so they need to both work locally and they need to work in composition with the other things that work locally and actually doing that a absolutely requires pluralism b it requires a much higher dimensional notion of what value can mean and a focus on coherence over consistency consistency here meaning [2309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2309.76s)

things match up exactly and you can point to them and say oh yes that means this this means that whereas coherence relaxes that and says okay the words the mechanisms the expectations in this regime and that regime could be different but when they encounter each other in the real world they they cohere enough they hang together and again biology nature actually has this like [2332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2332.44s)

the models or mechanisms that we use to describe the phenomena in nature are very distinct based on what you're modeling that they hang together they cohere um even when they don't agree jeff anything to add um i i was just taking notes on that because that i think is a really great um you know it's all about the the [2353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2353.98s)

um joints between these systems you know we can when we design joints you can design tightly coupled joints you can design loosely coupled joints and i think this is these tools are really interesting because we can in new ways blend things that couldn't be blended before you know like tokens can be seen as currency or what we say as money [2374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2374.8s)

um tokens can be seen as equity tokens can be seen as um voice tokens can be seen as all sorts of interesting things all in one vehicle um so i think there's really interesting new ways that we can design these joints and how loosely coupled or tightly coupled depending on their context um you know and to allow these these new systems to interoperate [2395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2395.38s)

um but also yeah like fractalize up sideways down um and i think there's there's sort of infinite diversity you know so interesting to consider one of the things that's really exciting for me about this is this idea of cooperation across social distance um in a system that coheres well so you know if you contrast especially when you [2414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2414.46s)

think about the current generation of [[social media]] in which we're all creating these echo chambers where we've got these filter bubbles and we're all kind of like doubling down within these these hollands uh uh these holes and that um that are smaller how do we create cooperation across social distance and you know the example of me being in boulder and someone else being in denver [2434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2434.619s)

if we both agree on the same [[public good]] maybe that's a signal to the state that that's a good [[public good]] or you know to use non-spatial analogy on [[gitcoin grants]] if someone who mostly funds eth2 projects and mostly in someone who mostly funds climate projects agree on a third project then that that social distance means that the that there's probably a lot of intelligence there and [2457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2457.3s)

so i know zargum when you were talking about uh using hearing cohesiveness of the multiple layers of the system so they act together and they don't revolt against each other that's kind of where where my mind went and you know maybe tokens can be used to do this to to jeff's point does that bring anything up for either of you yeah actually i mean there's a concept that i really like [2478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2478.48s)

um called uh subsidiarity which i believe originally stems from the catholic church's doctrine but it relates to pushing decision making authority down to the lowest level it can go to but no lower it kind of distributes load in scale and so there are some things that are very local like maybe i'm in a little working group with three people in a sub-door of a dao and [2499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2499.72s)

we're making decisions about something very operational in the context of that work and we've had that authority delegated to us but on the other hand there's going to be some decision making that might be um you know in that sub-dao or in that dao or you know as i'm moving up then some things are like the say it's on main net so the ethereum you know [2520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2520.599s)

protocol itself dictates a set of constraints on what we can do and then there's you know higher level things that might relate to um uh let's just say what we consider to be appropriate behavior period things that are maybe morally or ethically appropriate even if they're um you know not what even if they're within the scope of things you're able to do within any one of those rule systems and sorry that was a little bit rambly but the idea here is that there's decision making um that lives at every one of those scales concurrently and that what this some of this coherence comes from is sort of the really high level maybe [2562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2562.66s)

principles that that help us determine you know what our values are you know what kinds of activities are morally or ethically appropriate um and that allows for coherence and if we go down one level we might get something like a networking protocol and if we go down another level we might get something that's like more contextual and thus further defined and the further [2585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2585.04s)

you go down the more defined you get to your point about information though i think it is very interesting when things that are distant in that graph end up having similarities and then sort of exposing those similarities or reasoning about what information lives in the edges when something that was otherwise you know uncoupled turns out to be aligned correlated or otherwise same [2610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2610.38s)

that might change that might actually lead to a restructuring in the future it might creation of a new unit at at some mid scale that allows us to leverage that alignment i i think i keep looking to um biomimetic processes when it when it comes to a lot of these things and particularly like mycelial networks i think are a really great example one of [2635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2635.5s)

the most you know sustainable network economies in nature if you haven't seen the film fantastic fungi i definitely recommend checking it out but basically they're a distributed network that problem solves at the edges they're incredible resource allocators they move things from one part of the network to another they interact with various organisms like trees like all anything [2654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2654.88s)

underground is connected via mycelial networks which is transmitting information from parent trees to child trees or you know all over the the forest sort of thing so i think there's a lot that we can study and understand about the way that they sense make and you know they're also similar to neurons in the brain there are just all sorts of examples of these kinds of distributed [2679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2679.9s)

decision-making networks in nature that i think we can learn from and find those principles of sustainability that we can bring into our human economic systems such that they can act more sustainably and in in alignment with their environment um like we see in nature so i i would like to add something that maybe is meta commentary i really really [2702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2702.64s)

appreciate jeff because i live in this world where like i'm constantly trying to figure out all this really complex engineering and social system stuff with like legal scholars and economic scholars and engineering scholars and it can be really easy to get wrapped up in sort of big words and complex concepts and then try to design things that benefit from that knowledge but at the [2725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2725.859s)

end of the day it's not realistic to try to like sort of operate in that level of jargon all of the time and although i tend to live in that universe i work pretty closely with jeff and he does an amazing job making the the concepts that uh the block science team like either develops or learns about or collaborates with people on um widely accessible and i actually [2748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2748.54s)

think that's also an important primitive of good governance is to have legibility and sort of public engagement even when some of the mechanisms are the design of those mechanisms requires like pretty intensive sort of research and design work to find the thing which will hopefully itself be simple even if it was a long path to get there so hard fought simplicity as a goal and people [2773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2773.859s)

in your team and who's who are really good at taking the complex and making it accessible is really really valuable so anyway huge props to jeff so i'll stop talking now yeah well hopefully this episode will be more legible to the average listener uh because of you jeff well i think that we've spent about 43 minutes diverging and now it is time to converge as we only have five minutes [2797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2797.44s)

left so i'll ask you uh one broad uh closing question and the one very constrained closing question uh let's start with is there anything that i didn't ask that you wanna that you wanna talk about before we wrap i think the one of the most interesting things for me and web3 gets a lot of flack um you know there's there's a lot of [2817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2817.839s)

people thinking that web3 is here to um economize democracy but i think actually web3 is here to democratize economy um and i think there's you know there are only a few sort of large institutions capable of like enforcing like real change on this planet and it's you know governments corporations large-scale institutions [2839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2839.319s)

um but most of those are actually not democratic at all um in terms of realistically taking inputs from citizens or stakeholders especially those who are impacted um you know more so those who are impacted than those who are not i would say um so to the critics of web 3 out there saying hey you're just trying to make [2857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2857.44s)

governance for sale um i would say actually i think we're just trying to make economies which are probably the most fundamental coordination mechanism of humanity on a large scale more accountable to the people and the environment that they exist in that includes nature uh the planet ecologies um societies and so on [2880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2880.0s)

exactly if you're up can you top that i no i definitely can't top this i i will say that relatedly um for me this is very much about understanding algorithms as policies and it does tie into what jeff's saying in that um if we want to actually govern economies that we need to recognize that things like monetary policies and or [2901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2901.72s)

measurements of contributions or rewards or penalties etc are all algorithms that get developed by communities for the goals of those communities and that respecting that those things are policy making acts and enfranchising people in that policy making is a big part of how we could actually produce this institutional biodiversity this pluralism of this [2927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2927.64s)

effective pluralism um and obviously to jeff's point the the big win then is if we can successfully democratize our economies that's a great place to end it where can people find block science and you both online uh the blog science twitter is at block underscore science i'm at jeff hemet and i believe z you are at m zargum [2953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2953.68s)

that is correct we'll have those links in the show notes for easy clicking all right well thanks so much for joining us this is a really fun episode thanks for having us much appreciated yeah thanks again for having us and yeah jeff you definitely i think you nailed it with that last one yeah third moment of zen uh which i i took a note here a [2976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=2976.3s)

lot of people think that web3 is here to economize democracy what they don't see is web 3 is here to democratize economies i think that's really cool the symmetry in that that's where we'll end thanks again gentlemen thanks so much i gotta show you one more thing this those look familiar oh wow it's like a board meeting well no that my youth bot and my molok are right [3000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=3000.96s)

there at the other end of the table okay so i've actually got uh for people who are watching on video what we're looking at is if you look at my video i've got an e-spot and a molok which was an nft campaign that they get coindale did and zargum just showed us that he has physical statues of uh of of the eastbot molok nfts so uh that was a fun campaign and a fun little memory for that we have [3025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlug9tOQ8&t=3025.56s)

together all right cheers bye guys see ya great chatting music
