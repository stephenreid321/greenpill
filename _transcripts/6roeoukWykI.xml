peel back the</text><text start="189.28" dur="3.84">onion tell me about speedrun ethereum</text><text start="190.959" dur="4.801">and what you&apos;ve been working on recently</text><text start="193.12" dur="4.96">word heck yeah so speedrun ethereum is a</text><text start="195.76" dur="4.32">curriculum after doing tons of</text><text start="198.08" dur="3.28">mentorship sessions with lots of</text><text start="200.08" dur="3.439">developers</text><text start="201.36" dur="3.92">uh we finally kind of nailed down a</text><text start="203.519" dur="4.0">curriculum of things that you should run</text><text start="205.28" dur="4.16">through the the very first challenge is</text><text start="207.519" dur="2.64">like building a staking app and it shows</text><text start="209.44" dur="2.96">you</text><text start="210.159" dur="4.401">what ethereum is good for and it teaches</text><text start="212.4" dur="4.8">you through some of the gotchas so it&apos;s</text><text start="214.56" dur="4.64">just a good education platform in terms</text><text start="217.2" dur="4.959">of how you learn</text><text start="219.2" dur="3.84">what ethereum is for and how you figure</text><text start="222.159" dur="3.44">out</text><text start="223.04" dur="4.479">you know the concepts in the space and</text><text start="225.599" dur="3.28">and you know when people first get in</text><text start="227.519" dur="3.121">they start using it like a database and</text><text start="228.879" dur="3.201">it&apos;s like no no there&apos;s other stuff but</text><text start="230.64" dur="4.0">this is like this cool vending machine</text><text start="232.08" dur="4.799">you got to learn why it&apos;s cool right</text><text start="234.64" dur="4.72">so you&apos;re uh working in devrel at the</text><text start="236.879" dur="4.161">ethereum foundation speedrun ethereum is</text><text start="239.36" dur="2.72">kind of like a educational course in</text><text start="241.04" dur="4.0">which you can do</text><text start="242.08" dur="5.12">30-minute to 60-minute video educational</text><text start="245.04" dur="4.72">stuff about building d-apps with</text><text start="247.2" dur="4.399">ethereum and there&apos;s what like eight or</text><text start="249.76" dur="3.199">ten levels something like that where the</text><text start="251.599" dur="4.081">people can go through learning how to</text><text start="252.959" dur="5.12">run be build with scaffold eath which is</text><text start="255.68" dur="4.959">a development suite that that that you</text><text start="258.079" dur="4.481">pioneered is that more or less right</text><text start="260.639" dur="4.0">yeah exactly it starts to blur the lines</text><text start="262.56" dur="3.52">there toward the end be between what&apos;s a</text><text start="264.639" dur="3.441">challenge and what&apos;s a thing that&apos;s on</text><text start="266.08" dur="3.839">austin&apos;s to-do list that he&apos;s trying to</text><text start="268.08" dur="4.16">give off to you</text><text start="269.919" dur="5.201">okay so you&apos;ve created like a a tractor</text><text start="272.24" dur="4.64">to get developers going down this funnel</text><text start="275.12" dur="3.12">and then towards the end of speedrunning</text><text start="276.88" dur="3.12">ethereum they&apos;re actually helping you</text><text start="278.24" dur="4.959">build speedrun ethereum and this thing</text><text start="280.0" dur="4.8">called the build guild dao uh so tell us</text><text start="283.199" dur="2.72">tell us about the second layer like pull</text><text start="284.8" dur="2.64">back the light</text><text start="285.919" dur="3.361">on that</text><text start="287.44" dur="3.52">so yeah so that so that&apos;s probably like</text><text start="289.28" dur="4.08">build guild right so so i think actually</text><text start="290.96" dur="4.239">maybe the first layer is scaffold eve</text><text start="293.36" dur="3.52">and then the layer around that is speed</text><text start="295.199" dur="3.681">run ethereum and then the next layer</text><text start="296.88" dur="3.759">around that is build guild but if we</text><text start="298.88" dur="3.52">look at the the</text><text start="300.639" dur="3.84">layer that is build guild it&apos;s sort of</text><text start="302.4" dur="3.68">like the incentivization layer right</text><text start="304.479" dur="2.72">once the curriculum is there and people</text><text start="306.08" dur="2.64">have the tools and they&apos;re working</text><text start="307.199" dur="3.521">through things sometimes they need an</text><text start="308.72" dur="4.72">extra push sometimes they need a good</text><text start="310.72" dur="4.8">job sometimes they need to survive right</text><text start="313.44" dur="3.759">survival funds and that&apos;s kind of what</text><text start="315.52" dur="2.72">build guild is it&apos;s kind of developer</text><text start="317.199" dur="2.881">ubi</text><text start="318.24" dur="3.84">you&apos;re doing a good job you&apos;re learning</text><text start="320.08" dur="4.32">you&apos;re you&apos;re contributing i can stream</text><text start="322.08" dur="4.72">you a small amount of eth and you can</text><text start="324.4" dur="4.4">survive on that eth while you learn more</text><text start="326.8" dur="3.839">and either you know contribute back to</text><text start="328.8" dur="3.6">the ecosystem or maybe find a product</text><text start="330.639" dur="3.601">that you want to get into or i team you</text><text start="332.4" dur="4.0">up with an artist and and you guys kind</text><text start="334.24" dur="4.48">of like build something out so lots of</text><text start="336.4" dur="4.4">different paths there but yeah it&apos;s an</text><text start="338.72" dur="3.759">incentivization layer i think</text><text start="340.8" dur="3.44">right so i think of scaffolding is like</text><text start="342.479" dur="4.0">the ruby on rails of ethereum which</text><text start="344.24" dur="4.72">allows me to rapidly prototype it&apos;s just</text><text start="346.479" dur="4.321">really cool to build on scaffolding and</text><text start="348.96" dur="3.76">to build a new function into a smart</text><text start="350.8" dur="3.76">contract and then it automatically shows</text><text start="352.72" dur="3.52">up on the interface in my id app just</text><text start="354.56" dur="2.96">allows that scaffolding allows me to</text><text start="356.24" dur="4.16">move faster</text><text start="357.52" dur="4.56">uh in in building a d app so how many</text><text start="360.4" dur="2.96">devs are building on top of scaffolding</text><text start="362.08" dur="2.239">what&apos;s the footprint of scaffoldith</text><text start="363.36" dur="2.399">right now</text><text start="364.319" dur="3.521">it&apos;s really interesting because we don&apos;t</text><text start="365.759" dur="4.401">really have a lot of analytics there&apos;s</text><text start="367.84" dur="4.799">not a lot of hooks in scaffolding</text><text start="370.16" dur="4.0">in terms of like uh knowing how many</text><text start="372.639" dur="3.361">people are using it how many people are</text><text start="374.16" dur="3.12">forking it we know that there have been</text><text start="376.0" dur="3.28">you know more than</text><text start="377.28" dur="3.199">i think there&apos;s almost like 3 000 forks</text><text start="379.28" dur="2.88">of it right now</text><text start="380.479" dur="3.84">so there&apos;s there&apos;s tons of forks of it</text><text start="382.16" dur="4.08">that we can see on github but we don&apos;t</text><text start="384.319" dur="4.401">track exactly how many people are using</text><text start="386.24" dur="4.079">it we know that we&apos;ve had you know</text><text start="388.72" dur="3.52">more than two or three thousand people</text><text start="390.319" dur="3.921">coming through speedrun ethereum we&apos;ve</text><text start="392.24" dur="3.92">seen two or three thousand forks of</text><text start="394.24" dur="3.92">scaffolding but we don&apos;t have exact</text><text start="396.16" dur="4.319">numbers on how many people are using it</text><text start="398.16" dur="4.319">but it&apos;s it&apos;s cool to like go to a</text><text start="400.479" dur="3.28">hackathon and just have like tons of</text><text start="402.479" dur="3.521">people come up to me and be like yo i</text><text start="403.759" dur="3.761">use scaffolding to build the thing and</text><text start="406.0" dur="3.039">i don&apos;t even know about the thing but</text><text start="407.52" dur="3.519">the thing is like a popular thing and</text><text start="409.039" dur="4.0">it&apos;s yeah it&apos;s neat to see but we don&apos;t</text><text start="411.039" dur="4.321">have great numbers on it to be honest</text><text start="413.039" dur="4.401">got it so scaffolding or cypherpunk if</text><text start="415.36" dur="3.279">we don&apos;t track things right</text><text start="417.44" dur="5.8">there you go</text><text start="418.639" dur="4.601">lazy fair or cypherpunk uh</text><text start="423.919" dur="3.041">so scaffolding is basically like the</text><text start="425.44" dur="3.28">ruby on rails of ethereum allows you to</text><text start="426.96" dur="3.28">rapidly prototype d-apps and if you want</text><text start="428.72" dur="3.599">to learn scaffolding you can go to</text><text start="430.24" dur="4.48">speedrun ethereum.com and go through</text><text start="432.319" dur="4.241">kind of like a level leveling structure</text><text start="434.72" dur="2.96">and as you go through those levels you</text><text start="436.56" dur="2.4">kind of get dropped in these telegram</text><text start="437.68" dur="3.359">channels where you get introduced to</text><text start="438.96" dur="3.679">austin who will</text><text start="441.039" dur="3.041">give you stuff on his to-do list to</text><text start="442.639" dur="3.521">build out the future iterations of</text><text start="444.08" dur="3.76">scaffold ethereum and speedrun ethereum</text><text start="446.16" dur="3.759">maybe we&apos;ll give you an atta boy or an</text><text start="447.84" dur="4.16">atta girl on the back uh pat on the back</text><text start="449.919" dur="3.441">and maybe we&apos;ll give you some tokens in</text><text start="452.0" dur="3.28">exchange for building this funnel so</text><text start="453.36" dur="3.44">like the externality of all this is just</text><text start="455.28" dur="5.6">more developers who are building on</text><text start="456.8" dur="4.08">ethereum faster and better</text><text start="460.96" dur="4.88">did i conceive of that correctly even</text><text start="463.52" dur="4.799">even to add on to that more products and</text><text start="465.84" dur="4.56">prototypes coming out of it so like lots</text><text start="468.319" dur="4.16">of developers a lot a lot of times a</text><text start="470.4" dur="3.76">developer it&apos;s almost kind of a trick</text><text start="472.479" dur="4.081">because a developer says how do i get</text><text start="474.16" dur="3.759">hired in the space and i tell them well</text><text start="476.56" dur="3.44">you should speed run ethereum and build</text><text start="477.919" dur="3.601">this stuff but all the all the while i&apos;m</text><text start="480.0" dur="2.879">hoping that they don&apos;t get hired in the</text><text start="481.52" dur="2.88">space i&apos;m hoping that they build their</text><text start="482.879" dur="3.6">own product and they create something</text><text start="484.4" dur="3.919">new you know brand new in the space</text><text start="486.479" dur="4.4">so so there&apos;s kind of like different you</text><text start="488.319" dur="4.801">know levels of ejection out of the the</text><text start="490.879" dur="4.16">build guild level one is to just go get</text><text start="493.12" dur="3.84">hired level two is to build your own</text><text start="495.039" dur="3.521">product and level three is to like kind</text><text start="496.96" dur="3.44">of upgrade even farther and become more</text><text start="498.56" dur="4.639">of an auditor and learn learn kind of</text><text start="500.4" dur="4.72">the intricate details of the evm and and</text><text start="503.199" dur="3.44">auditing and solidity</text><text start="505.12" dur="3.04">right one of the things i think is so</text><text start="506.639" dur="3.441">cool about scaffolding is that you&apos;ve</text><text start="508.16" dur="3.68">got a template for anything sometimes i</text><text start="510.08" dur="5.12">dm you and i&apos;m like hey we want to build</text><text start="511.84" dur="5.119">this crazy nft experiment uh actually</text><text start="515.2" dur="4.16">maybe maybe moonshotbots is a great</text><text start="516.959" dur="3.681">example of this so like i have a call</text><text start="519.36" dur="2.559">with uh</text><text start="520.64" dur="2.48">someone associated with the get coin</text><text start="521.919" dur="3.201">ecosystem</text><text start="523.12" dur="4.08">in the middle of 2021 we&apos;re like hey</text><text start="525.12" dur="4.399">what if we did an nft that supported</text><text start="527.2" dur="4.24">public goods funding and i messaged you</text><text start="529.519" dur="3.76">on like a friday and you&apos;re like yeah i</text><text start="531.44" dur="4.24">use this scaffolding template and then i</text><text start="533.279" dur="4.401">hack on it over the weekend and on like</text><text start="535.68" dur="5.44">monday or tuesday you and i launched</text><text start="537.68"

start="607.839" dur="3.921">it&apos;s like this like kind of like white</text><text start="610.8" dur="3.68">simple</text><text start="611.76" dur="4.24">you know it looks like a html form and</text><text start="614.48" dur="3.52">you can kind of get in and do what you</text><text start="616.0" dur="3.839">need to do and it does the thing but</text><text start="618.0" dur="3.839">it&apos;s still not like polished and ready</text><text start="619.839" dur="3.601">for you know</text><text start="621.839" dur="3.12">ready to be a product someone needs to</text><text

that you have out there</text><text start="628.8" dur="3.279">like you&apos;re on the frontier tell me</text><text start="630.64" dur="4.8">what&apos;s the coolest thing you&apos;ve seen on</text><text start="632.079" dur="5.841">the frontier oh man i i think svg like</text><text start="635.44" dur="3.92">svg nfts are so much fun right now so so</text><text start="637.92" dur="3.68">there&apos;s probably one that i&apos;m not</text><text start="639.36" dur="3.44">thinking of that&apos;s like gonna be big in</text><text start="641.6" dur="3.12">like two months and i should have</text><text start="642.8" dur="3.52">thought of it at this moment but i&apos;m</text><text start="644.72" dur="4.16">kind of i kind of have tunnel vision</text><text start="646.32" dur="4.32">about svg and ft&apos;s right now just like</text><text start="648.88" dur="4.32">making an nft</text><text start="650.64" dur="4.72">where it&apos;s all rendered on chain the</text><text start="653.2" dur="4.96">smart contract itself basically draws</text><text start="655.36" dur="4.479">the thing and so we&apos;ve done we&apos;ve done a</text><text start="658.16" dur="3.679">handful of these on top of each other</text><text start="659.839" dur="3.841">where we did optimistic lookies and then</text><text start="661.839" dur="2.721">fancy loogies and then it&apos;s becoming a</text><text start="663.68" dur="2.24">game</text><text start="664.56" dur="2.719">can you explain what louise are because</text><text start="665.92" dur="3.599">i know they are but the audience might</text><text start="667.279" dur="6.081">not yeah that&apos;s a good point like</text><text start="669.519" dur="6.88">lugi was just a really simple spg nft</text><text start="673.36" dur="6.0">example we saw loot and a handful of</text><text start="676.399" dur="4.801">cool svg and fts really like take off</text><text start="679.36" dur="4.0">but to make them yourself it was kind of</text><text start="681.2" dur="4.079">complicated so i made sure to make like</text><text start="683.36" dur="4.479">a very very straightforward easy</text><text start="685.279" dur="4.8">forkable example of how to make an svg</text><text start="687.839" dur="3.68">nft and that was lugie&apos;s it&apos;s like a</text><text start="690.079" dur="3.44">little just like a little circle and two</text><text start="691.519" dur="3.921">little eyes it&apos;s like this little simple</text><text start="693.519" dur="5.121">character and it&apos;s all rendered within</text><text start="695.44" dur="4.8">the smart contract but the the coolest</text><text start="698.64" dur="3.759">you know fun</text><text start="700.24" dur="3.68">branches that i&apos;ve seen around this</text><text start="702.399" dur="4.801">are really kind of stretching it to the</text><text start="703.92" dur="6.96">limit where you you have you have these</text><text start="707.2" dur="5.68">loogies that are svg nfts but you can</text><text start="710.88" dur="3.44">mix them together or you can have them</text><text start="712.88" dur="3.759">all in a tank and they&apos;re like swimming</text><text start="714.32" dur="5.759">around in the tank and the tank itself</text><text start="716.639" dur="5.121">is an svg nft and when it calls its</text><text start="720.079" dur="3.601">render function it calls the render</text><text start="721.76" dur="4.24">function of all of the children inside</text><text start="723.68" dur="4.0">of it that it owns so there&apos;s this weird</text><text start="726.0" dur="4.24">composability stuff that you can do with</text><text start="727.68" dur="5.12">this but but honestly this is kind of a</text><text start="730.24" dur="5.039">like a flex it&apos;s kind of like a cool art</text><text start="732.8" dur="4.159">art kind of niche thing it&apos;s definitely</text><text start="735.279" dur="3.68">not changing the world and i think that</text><text start="736.959" dur="3.601">like maybe maybe if we zoomed out and</text><text start="738.959" dur="3.281">looked at some of the stuff we&apos;re doing</text><text start="740.56" dur="3.44">around like fundraising some of the</text><text start="742.24" dur="4.0">stuff we&apos;re doing around</text><text start="744.0" dur="4.0">streaming to developers</text><text start="746.24" dur="4.159">some of the things i don&apos;t know like</text><text start="748.0" dur="4.399">even like co-ownership of things there&apos;s</text><text start="750.399" dur="4.081">a lot of fun branches that i think might</text><text start="752.399" dur="4.481">be more popular in the future but right</text><text start="754.48" dur="4.32">now like svg nfts are hot and i think</text><text start="756.88" dur="3.84">they&apos;re fun yeah</text><text start="758.8" dur="3.52">yeah it&apos;s kind of fun to</text><text start="760.72" dur="4.0">play with that composability like the</text><text start="762.32" dur="4.48">lugies are just a very small sort of a</text><text start="764.72" dur="4.08">ton atomic organism and then you can put</text><text start="766.8" dur="3.76">them in a fish tank together someone</text><text start="768.8" dur="3.279">could build a way to mate them with each</text><text start="770.56" dur="3.279">other you could have them fight to the</text><text start="772.079" dur="3.281">death they could race in like a mario</text><text start="773.839" dur="3.68">kart type thing</text><text start="775.36" dur="4.0">from there and so it&apos;s it&apos;s sort of neat</text><text start="777.519" dur="3.361">to have that very basic building block</text><text start="779.36" dur="3.919">and then see what the community does</text><text start="780.88" dur="4.72">once that primitive is out there</text><text start="783.279" dur="3.36">exactly yep</text><text start="785.6" dur="2.239">so tell me about the other ones you&apos;re</text><text start="786.639" dur="4.081">excited about you said streaming to</text><text start="787.839" dur="4.961">developers and a couple other ones</text><text start="790.72" dur="3.52">there&apos;s okay so let me let me just think</text><text start="792.8" dur="3.36">through some of the fun ones we have</text><text start="794.24" dur="3.52">like a multi-sig as a service branch</text><text start="796.16" dur="3.2">which is kind of like a</text><text start="797.76" dur="3.44">simple gnosis safe where you get a</text><text start="799.36" dur="5.12">signature base gnosis safe out of the</text><text start="801.2" dur="5.04">box it&apos;s actually hosted at multisig.lol</text><text start="804.48" dur="4.08">but you can go to multisig.lol you can</text><text start="806.24" dur="4.48">spin up a multi-sig uh you know</text><text start="808.56" dur="4.8">disclaimer not it&apos;s not an audited</text><text start="810.72" dur="4.4">contract like it&apos;s still a developer</text><text start="813.36" dur="4.0">thing you shouldn&apos;t probably go do that</text><text start="815.12" dur="4.719">and make a business out of it yet</text><text start="817.36" dur="4.56">but you could and there&apos;s not a lot of</text><text start="819.839" dur="4.0">there&apos;s basically one good multi-sig in</text><text start="821.92" dur="2.96">the space right now and so this is just</text><text start="823.839" dur="2.961">like kind of adding to that</text><text start="824.88" dur="4.319">composability hopefully like adding to</text><text start="826.8" dur="4.479">that ecosystem there&apos;s like a mobile app</text><text start="829.199" dur="3.361">that you can fork of ours that&apos;s like a</text><text start="831.279" dur="4.56">working</text><text start="832.56" dur="4.56">app wallet like in the that that we sent</text><text start="835.839" dur="3.44">to the</text><text start="837.12" dur="5.04">the app store and it works</text><text start="839.279" dur="3.92">there&apos;s uh just like lots of svg and fts</text><text start="842.16" dur="3.2">of course</text><text start="843.199" dur="3.44">uh a lot of games and challenges like</text><text start="845.36" dur="2.96">the like</text><text start="846.639" dur="3.121">we had someone build a dice game and</text><text start="848.32" dur="3.519">then we had someone build something that</text><text start="849.76" dur="3.12">attacked the dice game and it like shows</text><text start="851.839" dur="2.721">how to do</text><text start="852.88" dur="3.6">randomness on chain and this is this is</text><text start="854.56" dur="4.16">more like feeding back into the</text><text start="856.48" dur="3.44">challenges but these are like new</text><text start="858.72" dur="3.6">challenges that were added to the</text><text start="859.92" dur="5.2">speedrun recently from other people like</text><text start="862.32" dur="5.44">exploring different uh uh kind of you</text><text start="865.12" dur="4.959">know avenues of randomness we have a</text><text start="867.76" dur="3.92">game coming out in a little while that&apos;s</text><text start="870.079" dur="3.681">supposed to kind of kind of like crypto</text><text start="871.68" dur="4.24">zombies like trying to trying to redo</text><text start="873.76" dur="5.28">crypto zombies teach you the the the</text><text start="875.92" dur="5.52">syntax and teach you how to build things</text><text start="879.04" dur="4.88">lots of dexes and multisigs coming out</text><text start="881.44" dur="3.6">i&apos;m scrolling through the the branches</text><text start="883.92" dur="3.279">the builds</text><text start="885.04" dur="4.0">yeah so yeah so one of the things i so</text><text start="887.199" dur="4.0">so you and i uh were co-work stream</text><text start="889.04" dur="3.52">leads of a get going downward stream</text><text start="891.199" dur="2.88">called the moonshot collective for a</text><text start="892.56" dur="3.12">little while which was kind of like</text><text start="894.079" dur="3.2">almost like get coindal meets build</text><text start="895.68" dur="4.24">guild it&apos;s a place for developers to</text><text start="897.279" dur="4.081">hang out and and build stuff together</text><text start="899.92" dur="3.52">and and you and i kind of worked on a</text><text start="901.36" dur="3.44">few prototypes together i&apos;d love to talk</text><text start="903.44" dur="3.519">about some of the tools that we</text><text start="904.8" dur="4.479">pioneered there or i guess more or less</text><text start="906.959" dur="3.601">you pioneered but um like the streaming</text><text start="909.279" dur="3.441">streaming to developer thing i just</text><text start="910.56" dur="4.079">think it&apos;s so neat how how that works</text><text start="912.72" dur="5.04">because like as i understand it you get</text><text start="914.639" dur="6.0">on a call with a developer and</text><text start="917.76" dur="5.28">and and you like insta hire them on the</text><text start="920.639" dur="3.76">spot and you start streaming them tokens</text><text start="923.04" dur="3.44">and and basically you built this</text><text start="924.399" dur="4.641">streaming contract where if they submit</text><text start="926.48" dur="3.84">a report once a week then of what</text><text start="929.04" dur="2.96">they&apos;ve been working on then they</text><text start="930.32" dur="4.639">continue to get paid but if they ghost</text><text start="932.0" dur="4.399">you after that then they no longer get</text><text start="934.959" dur="3.361">paid anymore so it&apos;s like a streaming</text><text start="936.399" dur="3.12">that fills up and they have to claim it</text><text start="938.32" dur="3.04">and empty it once per week and the</text><text start="939.519" dur="3.281">mechanism what that does is it allows</text><text start="941.36" dur="3.12">you to continue pulling them down the</text><text start="942.8" dur="2.959">rabbit hole by making the hiring</text><text start="944.48" dur="3.84">decision really quickly because you have</text><text start="945.759" dur="4.08">that gating mechanism down down the line</text><text start="948.32" dur="3.36">and i just thought that was like wow</text><text start="949.839" dur="3.601">i&apos;ve never met a hiring manager that</text><text start="951.68" dur="3.599">will just insta hire people casually on</text><text start="953.44" dur="4.24">the spot and start streaming them</text><text start="955.279" dur="4.161">streaming them tokens so you know those</text><text start="957.68" dur="3.279">kind of innovations i think are</text><text start="959.44" dur="3.68">really kind of fun</text><text start="960.959" dur="3.68">tell me tell me more about about that</text><text start="963.12" dur="4.24">i think i mean it just kind of happened</text><text start="964.639" dur="4.56">randomly right like i i built a stream</text><text start="967.36" dur="3.919">but i realized like if the stream just</text><text start="969.199" dur="4.401">flows forever then</text><text start="971.279" dur="4.401">you kind of get yourself underwater by</text><text start="973.6" dur="3.76">streaming to a whole bunch of developers</text><text start="975.68" dur="3.04">but if you make the stream a withdrawal</text><text start="977.36" dur="3.36">pattern and you have that withdrawal</text><text start="978.72" dur="3.679">pattern kind of auditable and</text><text start="980.72" dur="3.44">accountable to everyone</text><text start="982.399" dur="3.36">then you end up with this you know</text><text start="984.16" dur="4.08">there&apos;s there&apos;s probably about 50</text><text start="985.759" dur="4.401">streams right now that i have open but</text><text start="988.24" dur="4.48">you know only a small subset of those</text><text start="990.16" dur="4.32">are actually like live pulling from</text><text start="992.72" dur="3.6">those so it allows people to kind of</text><text start="994.48" dur="3.44">check out and go do things other things</text><text start="996.32" dur="3.199">and come back and that was kind of</text><text start="997.92" dur="3.919">something we realized about the dow is</text><text start="999.519" dur="5.201">is we&apos;re going to have developers that</text><text start="1001.839" dur="4.881">kind of moonlight or go from dow to dao</text><text start="1004.72" dur="4.16">or you know come come work for us for a</text><text start="1006.72" dur="4.32">little bit and then go back so it&apos;s just</text><text start="1008.88" dur="4.56">it&apos;s just way easier to say hey you&apos;re</text><text start="1011.04" dur="4.799">contributing there&apos;s now this new stream</text><text start="1013.44" dur="4.48">pulling to you you know flowing to you</text><text start="1015.839" dur="3.68">you can pull from it as you need and you</text><text start="1017.92" dur="3.839">turn in your work and you price it</text><text start="1019.519" dur="4.161">yourself and it&apos;s trust based and then</text><text start="1021.759" dur="4.16">there&apos;s 50 other people like you and you</text><text start="1023.68" dur="4.56">can go see what all of them are building</text><text start="1025.919" dur="4.561">and turning in and they all are keeping</text><text start="1028.24" dur="4.079">their eyes on all the other streams so</text><text start="1030.48" dur="4.559">it&apos;s kind of like a social contract with</text><text start="1032.319" dur="4.48">everyone that you&apos;ll equally price your</text><text start="1035.039" dur="3.76">work and every once in a while we have</text><text start="1036.799" dur="3.76">some outliers that maybe don&apos;t do as</text><text start="1038.799" dur="3.28">much work or they turn in something</text><text start="1040.559" dur="4.0">that&apos;s not really priced</text><text start="1042.079" dur="4.081">and and maybe they do it once but they</text><text start="1044.559" dur="3.601">just don&apos;t do it repeatedly and i don&apos;t</text><text start="1046.16" dur="4.399">know if it&apos;s like human behavior or</text><text start="1048.16" dur="5.44">somehow we have just magically found</text><text start="1050.559" dur="4.961">good humans but it&apos;s it seemed to work</text><text start="1053.6" dur="4.0">you know pretty well we&apos;ve had a couple</text><text start="1055.52" dur="4.32">people phase out but we haven&apos;t really</text><text start="1057.6" dur="4.4">had any problems with this kind of trust</text><text start="1059.84" dur="4.0">based model now that we talk about it a</text><text start="1062.0" dur="3.679">lot online i&apos;m sure</text><text start="1063.84" dur="4.24">it can get attacked but people gotta be</text><text start="1065.679" dur="3.521">adversarial circumstances yeah so how</text><text start="1068.08" dur="1.839">many people you got on a stream right</text><text start="1069.2" dur="2.24">now</text><text start="1069.919" dur="2.88">i think 50. i think we have about 50</text><text start="1071.44" dur="3.52">streams so we have</text><text start="1072.799" dur="3.521">so when you go for go into speedrun i</text><text start="1074.96" dur="3.839">think the number right now is about</text><text start="1076.32" dur="4.08">maybe two to three thousand people have</text><text start="1078.799" dur="4.0">started the speed run</text><text start="1080.4" dur="5.12">about when you finish the speed run you</text><text start="1082.799" dur="4.801">plop out and you land in build guild and</text><text start="1085.52" dur="3.76">you have a couple more like</text><text start="1087.6" dur="3.36">bigger challenges that you have to build</text><text start="1089.28" dur="3.2">they&apos;re kind of more open-ended so we</text><text start="1090.96" dur="4.64">have about two to three thousand</text><text start="1092.48" dur="4.559">starting we have about four to 500</text><text start="1095.6" dur="3.12">kind of all the way through that it</text><text start="1097.039" dur="3.76">popped out in build guild and then we</text><text start="1098.72" dur="4.72">have about 50 that are on streams right</text><text start="1100.799" dur="3.921">now and probably another 30 or 40 that</text><text start="1103.44" dur="4.16">are just like getting random</text><text start="1104.72" dur="5.04">scholarships we using multisig.lol we</text><text start="1107.6" dur="4.72">basically have like a scholarship</text><text start="1109.76" dur="5.36">multi-sig and so that&apos;s easy for me to</text><text start="1112.32" dur="5.04">like yolo you know 50 bucks to someone</text><text start="1115.12" dur="4.72">who&apos;s just just contributed one small</text><text start="1117.36" dur="4.64">thing but that helps to like get them in</text><text start="1119.84" dur="4.8">and like you said give them an atta boy</text><text start="1122.0" dur="5.36">and tell them to take this eath and go</text><text start="1124.64" dur="5.84">register an ens address or go deploy a</text><text start="1127.36" dur="6.72">gnosis safe or you know spend it on gas</text><text start="1130.48" dur="5.36">or deploy a contract to make an nft so</text><text start="1134.08" dur="3.52">50 i guess is the answer to that but</text><text start="1135.84" dur="3.839">there&apos;s kind of like a soft another</text><text start="1137.6" dur="3.52">probably soft 50 of like</text><text start="1139.679" dur="2.801">just little scholarships here and there</text><text start="1141.12" dur="3.52">to folks</text><text start="1142.48" dur="4.88">right okay um are there other ways that</text><text start="1144.64" dur="4.08">you&apos;re compensating developers in in the</text><text start="1147.36" dur="3.439">build guild that are sort of like</text><text start="1148.72" dur="3.839">augment the streams or</text><text start="1150.799" dur="3.281">like are you guys doing any tip parties</text><text start="1152.559" dur="4.161">or any sort of like inter-subjective</text><text start="1154.08" dur="4.4">tools to get people paid</text><text start="1156.72" dur="4.16">we tried we tinkered around with that</text><text start="1158.48" dur="4.319">we&apos;re just so async like we don&apos;t really</text><text start="1160.88" dur="4.0">get together that regularly we get</text><text start="1162.799" dur="4.481">together maybe every two weeks and it&apos;s</text><text start="1164.88" dur="4.56">just people showing off their builds so</text><text start="1167.28" dur="4.56">it was just a little bit too formal to</text><text start="1169.44" dur="4.16">to have like a coordinate model of like</text><text start="1171.84" dur="3.92">let&apos;s get together and pay people based</text><text start="1173.6" dur="4.319">on everyone voting we tried it we</text><text start="1175.76" dur="4.32">tinkered around with it it didn&apos;t it was</text><text start="1177.919" dur="3.841">just like kind of too hands-on for for</text><text start="1180.08" dur="3.52">build guild builders we&apos;re a bunch of</text><text start="1181.76" dur="2.72">like introverted nerds that just want to</text><text start="1183.6" dur="2.319">kind of</text><text start="1184.48" dur="3.84">we don&apos;t want to be in meetings we want</text><text start="1185.919" dur="3.681">to be working and building things right</text><text start="1188.32" dur="3.04">so so</text><text start="1189.6" dur="4.56">the in terms of like</text><text start="1191.36" dur="4.08">extra revenue other than the streams now</text><text start="1194.16" dur="4.16">and then there&apos;s maybe like a</text><text start="1195.44" dur="5.2">scholarship here and there but uh what i</text><text start="1198.32" dur="5.839">try to do is push developers toward the</text><text start="1200.64" dur="6.0">end to deploy their own nft like build</text><text start="1204.159" dur="4.561">build a small low limit in ft</text><text start="1206.64" dur="3.68">make make some cool art and i&apos;ll be the</text><text start="1208.72" dur="3.68">first person to buy that i&apos;ll buy a</text><text start="1210.32" dur="4.56">couple of them right so there is like</text><text start="1212.4" dur="4.159">this kind of like graduating them to</text><text start="1214.88" dur="3.76">building their own products that can</text><text start="1216.559" dur="4.961">raise funds for themselves to kind of</text><text start="1218.64" dur="3.76">keep keep going on their own</text><text start="1221.52" dur="2.159">right</text><text start="1222.4" dur="2.399">okay</text><text start="1223.679" dur="3.36">got it</text><text start="1224.799" dur="2.24">um</text><text start="1229.76" dur="3.2">it&apos;s it&apos;s like how many how many</text><text start="1231.12" dur="4.48">developers total do you think are like</text><text start="1232.96" dur="4.64">actually in the build guild right now</text><text start="1235.6" dur="3.68">it&apos;s the number is 400 and some but</text><text start="1237.6" dur="3.439">there was like a quick point where there</text><text start="1239.28" dur="4.639">was maybe like a civil attack where we</text><text start="1241.039" dur="5.041">had like maybe 20 or 30 come in like we</text><text start="1243.919" dur="4.721">we tried to program we we try to do as</text><text start="1246.08" dur="4.88">much like okay it seems like we need to</text><text start="1248.64" dur="5.36">reward folks at this moment</text><text start="1250.96" dur="4.4">i&apos;m doing it kind of naturally in chat</text><text start="1254.0" dur="2.799">but let&apos;s try to build it into the</text><text start="1255.36" dur="3.439">system and there was like one time we</text><text start="1256.799" dur="3.36">built a function into build guild where</text><text start="1258.799" dur="2.401">you get to a certain point and it just</text><text start="1260.159" dur="2.801">gives you</text><text start="1261.2" dur="4.08">50 to 100</text><text start="1262.96" dur="4.24">blindly and someone immediately was</text><text start="1265.28" dur="3.68">civil attacking that so it was like well</text><text start="1267.2" dur="3.839">i guess we can&apos;t do it that way so so</text><text start="1268.96" dur="5.12">there&apos;s a small civil attack that led us</text><text start="1271.039" dur="5.041">up to maybe 450 450 people but i would</text><text start="1274.08" dur="4.64">say there&apos;s about 400 people like actual</text><text start="1276.08" dur="5.839">real humans uh in the build guild but i</text><text start="1278.72" dur="5.839">only honestly have seen about 40 of them</text><text start="1281.919" dur="4.561">face to face so it&apos;s a lot of anonymous</text><text start="1284.559" dur="4.0">folks that are just going through that i</text><text start="1286.48" dur="3.6">don&apos;t know anything about but that are</text><text start="1288.559" dur="3.6">kind of like right on the edge now of</text><text start="1290.08" dur="4.4">like possibly getting funds from a</text><text start="1292.159" dur="4.64">stream or from a scholarship or building</text><text start="1294.48" dur="3.199">something so we&apos;ll see</text><text start="1296.799" dur="2.321">right</text><text start="1297.679" dur="2.641">well where is this all going it seems</text><text start="1299.12" dur="2.96">like you&apos;ve kind of built this like</text><text start="1300.32" dur="3.52">you&apos;re like the pied piper of ethereum</text><text start="1302.08" dur="4.4">developers over here where are you</text><text start="1303.84" dur="4.719">leading your troop of developers</text><text start="1306.48" dur="4.4">well hopefully uh honestly like</text><text start="1308.559" dur="3.12">hopefully there&apos;s not</text><text start="1310.88" dur="2.56">like</text><text start="1311.679" dur="4.401">hopefully it&apos;s not a traditional top</text><text start="1313.44" dur="5.44">down structure we&apos;re trying to build</text><text start="1316.08" dur="5.12">like a hyper structure of education and</text><text start="1318.88" dur="4.159">building right i think what you you even</text><text start="1321.2" dur="3.44">talked about a lot with moonshot is</text><text start="1323.039" dur="4.161">trying to build the machine that builds</text><text start="1324.64" dur="5.6">machines right we want right we want you</text><text start="1327.2" dur="5.28">have kind of a</text><text start="1330.24" dur="3.439">a self-fulfilling system in a lot of</text><text start="1332.48" dur="2.8">ways where</text><text start="1333.679" dur="3.441">there&apos;s more and more developers coming</text><text start="1335.28" dur="3.279">in and they love to contribute like all</text><text start="1337.12" dur="3.2">of them are just like this was such a</text><text start="1338.559" dur="3.841">good program how do i contribute back</text><text start="1340.32" dur="3.359">how do i do more and it&apos;s like go build</text><text start="1342.4" dur="3.84">something and let&apos;s turn it into a</text><text start="1343.679" dur="5.521">challenge that i think the overall goal</text><text start="1346.24" dur="4.64">is lots of devs coming into the space</text><text start="1349.2" dur="4.08">having the right tools in education to</text><text start="1350.88" dur="4.0">go on and do their own thing but if they</text><text start="1353.28" dur="3.759">do want to contribute back having a</text><text start="1354.88" dur="4.24">system that allows them to do so in a</text><text start="1357.039" dur="3.52">way that kind of keeps the machine going</text><text start="1359.12" dur="2.88">kind of builds more challenges and</text><text start="1360.559" dur="3.201">builds more community</text><text start="1362.0" dur="3.44">right so it&apos;s almost like it seems like</text><text start="1363.76" dur="3.2">it&apos;s almost like conway&apos;s game of life</text><text start="1365.44" dur="3.359">in a certain way like it&apos;s composed it&apos;s</text><text start="1366.96" dur="3.68">like building itself but there&apos;s no</text><text start="1368.799" dur="3.441">specific direction other than just</text><text start="1370.64" dur="3.68">having more developers into the space</text><text start="1372.24" dur="3.52">and they can go off and do whatever they</text><text start="1374.32" dur="4.32">want but they can come back to the build</text><text start="1375.76" dur="3.84">guild and have not a fraternity but like</text><text start="1378.64" dur="3.039">a</text><text start="1379.6" dur="4.4">camaraderie with other builders it&apos;s</text><text start="1381.679" dur="5.041">like a club that that that you&apos;re in</text><text start="1384.0" dur="4.32">it is the most introverted club ever too</text><text start="1386.72" dur="5.36">like when we got out when we get on the</text><text start="1388.32" dur="6.64">calls it&apos;s like me and 20 nerds in a</text><text start="1392.08" dur="4.24">youtube and it&apos;s silent</text><text start="1394.96" dur="2.8">is that why you&apos;re always you&apos;re always</text><text start="1396.32" dur="3.76">like bringing the energy level i got to</text><text start="1397.76" dur="5.12">bring the energy for all 20 of us here</text><text start="1400.08" dur="4.479">yeah okay yeah yeah which is i mean</text><text start="1402.88" dur="3.6">those are my people right</text><text start="1404.559" dur="4.0">folks that are quiet and want to build</text><text start="1406.48" dur="5.84">things so yes it is kind of like a</text><text start="1408.559" dur="5.6">fraternity but a very quiet fraternity</text><text start="1412.32" dur="3.28">right seems like there&apos;s a lot of just</text><text start="1414.159" dur="3.841">kind of like dry powder there from an</text><text start="1415.6" dur="3.6">intellectual and engineering perspective</text><text start="1418.0" dur="3.6">that could do a lot of good for the</text><text start="1419.2" dur="4.079">space um i&apos;m curious like with these</text><text start="1421.6" dur="3.12">builders you know we&apos;ve just talked so</text><text start="1423.279" dur="3.681">much on on twitter about the market</text><text start="1424.72" dur="3.52">being down and sentiment being down but</text><text start="1426.96" dur="2.8">are you seeing as many builders come</text><text start="1428.24" dur="2.88">into the space and if so has the</text><text start="1429.76" dur="3.12">sentiment changed at all over the last</text><text start="1431.12" dur="4.4">couple months</text><text start="1432.88" dur="5.279">i think i mean like for sure just my own</text><text start="1435.52" dur="3.759">ability to fund developers has shrunk</text><text start="1438.159" dur="4.081">right like</text><text start="1439.279" dur="5.121">like i i used to be able to yolo</text><text start="1442.24" dur="4.16">these streams a lot quicker</text><text start="1444.4" dur="4.08">and you know i used to</text><text start="1446.4" dur="4.24">have enough money that i could just be</text><text start="1448.48" dur="4.559">like yes go here you go go you know and</text><text start="1450.64" dur="3.36">so my own ability has kind of shrunk a</text><text start="1453.039" dur="2.161">little bit</text><text start="1454.0" dur="3.2">uh i</text><text start="1455.2" dur="4.079">i would say that like maybe some of the</text><text start="1457.2" dur="4.32">bs has gone down and there&apos;s more</text><text start="1459.279" dur="3.601">builders that are like a little bit more</text><text start="1461.52" dur="4.24">focused</text><text start="1462.88" dur="5.36">uh on like creating cool things rather</text><text start="1465.76" dur="4.64">than creating things that make money</text><text start="1468.24" dur="3.76">uh but yeah i don&apos;t</text><text start="1470.4" dur="3.6">that i don&apos;t know if we&apos;ve even really</text><text start="1472.0" dur="4.64">felt the effects totally of the market</text><text start="1474.0" dur="4.799">going down yet in terms of these these</text><text start="1476.64" dur="2.88">like these numbers of developers coming</text><text start="1478.799" dur="2.801">in</text><text start="1479.52" dur="4.48">i i don&apos;t have a great</text><text start="1481.6" dur="4.24">you know uh feeling about how how it&apos;s</text><text start="1484.0" dur="3.679">going it seems like people are still</text><text start="1485.84" dur="4.0">continuing to stream in</text><text start="1487.679" dur="4.401">i mean uh influencers are getting like</text><text start="1489.84" dur="3.68">less likes and stuff like that but i</text><text start="1492.08" dur="4.16">would say that we still have tons of</text><text start="1493.52" dur="4.88">builders quietly building i don&apos;t know</text><text start="1496.24" dur="4.24">the market overall only</text><text start="1498.4" dur="3.92">only affects my ability to pay people</text><text start="1500.48" dur="3.28">more than anything i think</text><text start="1502.32" dur="3.04">right okay</text><text start="1503.76" dur="2.88">the dry powder thing i want to pull that</text><text start="1505.36" dur="2.64">thread though you talked about dry</text><text start="1506.64" dur="2.72">powder i think i think it&apos;s so true i</text><text start="1508.0" dur="3.2">think there&apos;s all these introverts that</text><text start="1509.36" dur="3.52">are building these cool things that are</text><text start="1511.2" dur="3.76">basically making prototypes and you&apos;ve</text><text start="1512.88" dur="4.32">seen it too and i think it&apos;s something</text><text start="1514.96" dur="4.4">fun for us to noodle on a little bit</text><text start="1517.2" dur="4.8">some of these prototypes aren&apos;t really</text><text start="1519.36" dur="4.16">ready for mainstream sometimes some of</text><text start="1522.0" dur="4.0">these builders are building things that</text><text start="1523.52" dur="4.399">have been built before or aren&apos;t aren&apos;t</text><text start="1526.0" dur="3.279">quite products themselves and that&apos;s</text><text start="1527.919" dur="3.36">something that i think the build guild</text><text start="1529.279" dur="4.0">needs to do better at we need to do</text><text start="1531.279" dur="5.441">better at going pro</text><text start="1533.279" dur="5.841">if if we want to really like you know uh</text><text start="1536.72" dur="4.079">use this dry powder and and really like</text><text start="1539.12" dur="4.159">build a cannon and fire some cannon</text><text start="1540.799" dur="6.561">balls i think that we have to</text><text start="1543.279" dur="5.601">focus on going pro and and</text><text start="1547.36" dur="3.679">as a builder comes through and they kind</text><text start="1548.88" dur="4.399">of ship one or two things it&apos;s fine if</text><text start="1551.039" dur="3.841">those things are ugly and kind of do the</text><text start="1553.279" dur="3.441">thing they need to do but don&apos;t look</text><text start="1554.88" dur="4.0">professional but i need to start</text><text start="1556.72" dur="4.559">transitioning builders from building</text><text start="1558.88" dur="4.799">prototypes to building products and that</text><text start="1561.279" dur="4.161">takes a an extra thing and you you know</text><text start="1563.679" dur="4.081">it too right you you really have to</text><text start="1565.44" dur="5.119">polish something up and that last 20</text><text start="1567.76" dur="4.32">takes so long to get it right and</text><text start="1570.559" dur="2.881">finding product market fit and all that</text><text start="1572.08" dur="2.8">kind of stuff so that&apos;s something i</text><text start="1573.44" dur="3.119">definitely want to noodle on with you</text><text start="1574.88" dur="3.36">just because it&apos;s something that we&apos;ve</text><text start="1576.559" dur="4.961">kind of maybe even butted heads about a</text><text start="1578.24" dur="5.36">little bit in the past how how do i get</text><text start="1581.52" dur="3.68">these build guild builders that build</text><text start="1583.6" dur="4.559">things to 80</text><text start="1585.2" dur="4.719">to to have a few things that go to 100</text><text start="1588.159" dur="3.041">and knock a few things out of the park</text><text start="1589.919" dur="2.64">and that&apos;s that&apos;s kind of an open</text><text start="1591.2" dur="3.359">question</text><text start="1592.559" dur="4.161">right yeah building</text><text start="1594.559" dur="4.48">legos versus building totally</text><text start="1596.72" dur="3.76">polished product projects can be really</text><text start="1599.039" dur="4.081">tough but you know one thing i think get</text><text start="1600.48" dur="4.0">coin fell ass backwards into is an</text><text start="1603.12" dur="2.799">audience that already understands</text><text start="1604.48" dur="2.64">metamask and private keys and</text><text start="1605.919" dur="3.521">transactions you know we&apos;re building for</text><text start="1607.12" dur="3.439">developers and you just get so much when</text><text start="1609.44" dur="2.88">you&apos;re just building for an audience</text><text start="1610.559" dur="3.921">that has a computer

dur="2.64">about it like</text><text start="1909.12" dur="3.6">the way</text><text start="1910.24" dur="4.799">the way we&apos;re working as prototypers is</text><text start="1912.72" dur="4.0">we&apos;re watching all y&apos;all do cool things</text><text start="1915.039" dur="3.36">and as soon as vitalik says something</text><text start="1916.72" dur="3.36">about soulbound nfts and there&apos;s like</text><text start="1918.399" dur="4.16">four different prototypes of sold-out</text><text start="1920.08" dur="4.8">nfts coming out of build guild right so</text><text

dive in and</text><text start="1930.88" dur="3.039">start building a bunch of prototypes</text><text start="1932.159" dur="3.921">around it well what i&apos;m really excited</text><text start="1933.919" dur="4.64">about is is like soul bound nfts are</text><text start="1936.08" dur="5.52">like the i think that their soul bounds</text><text start="1938.559" dur="4.72">or tokens or dids are like the trees and</text><text start="1941.6" dur="3.12">you got to see the forest so i&apos;m really</text><text start="1943.279" dur="3.441">excited about this idea of decentralized</text><text start="1944.72" dur="4.319">society which is basically</text><text start="1946.72" dur="5.28">you know i i issue you an nf a soul</text><text start="1949.039" dur="5.12">bound nft you&apos;re a vac that says austin</text><text start="1952.0" dur="3.919">has the best dance moves of any uh</text><text start="1954.159" dur="4.4">developer that i&apos;ve ever known and</text><text start="1955.919" dur="4.561">you&apos;re and get coins issuing these nfts</text><text start="1958.559" dur="3.201">that say that you contributed to get</text><text start="1960.48" dur="3.439">coin grants and so basically what you&apos;re</text><text start="1961.76" dur="4.0">doing is you&apos;re creating these little</text><text start="1963.919" dur="3.681">uh intersubjective identities in which</text><text start="1965.76" dur="4.56">we&apos;re all attesting to each other and at</text><text start="1967.6" dur="5.6">scale that that that</text><text start="1970.32" dur="4.64">really liquid uh reputation system</text><text start="1973.2" dur="4.319">allows you to do a lot of interesting</text><text start="1974.96" dur="3.92">things with on chain identity because</text><text start="1977.519" dur="2.88">like basically you&apos;re building up these</text><text start="1978.88" dur="2.96">reputations over time you&apos;re accruing</text><text start="1980.399" dur="4.0">them and then you can do things like</text><text start="1981.84" dur="3.679">under collateralized loans to these</text><text start="1984.399" dur="2.481">people because like you know who they</text><text start="1985.519" dur="2.721">are or unless you know something about</text><text start="1986.88" dur="3.919">that where they are so there&apos;s like a</text><text start="1988.24" dur="4.72">network effect to build where more</text><text start="1990.799" dur="4.561">soulbound tokens dids creates more</text><text start="1992.96" dur="3.92">utility for those kind of things and</text><text start="1995.36" dur="2.88">more utility means that more people will</text><text start="1996.88" dur="3.279">build them and it&apos;s just about spinning</text><text start="1998.24" dur="3.279">that so i don&apos;t know i&apos;m excited more i</text><text start="2000.159" dur="2.88">guess the tldrs i&apos;m more excited about</text><text start="2001.519" dur="3.841">decentralized society than i am about</text><text start="2003.039" dur="3.841">slow down tokens and and that&apos;s why i&apos;m</text><text start="2005.36" dur="4.48">sending some cycles there</text><text start="2006.88" dur="3.76">dope cool yeah and i one thing that</text><text start="2009.84" dur="2.559">like</text><text start="2010.64" dur="3.68">is gonna help with that is all of these</text><text start="2012.399" dur="4.0">layer twos and being able to make some</text><text start="2014.32" dur="5.28">of these attestations at a much cheaper</text><text start="2016.399" dur="5.28">rate and a much faster quicker you know</text><text start="2019.6" dur="4.559">a network that still has the same</text><text start="2021.679" dur="4.801">security as as l1 ethereum</text><text start="2024.159" dur="4.4">so i think that like we think about</text><text start="2026.48" dur="3.919">you know some kind of social app where</text><text start="2028.559" dur="4.161">we&apos;re able to communicate with each</text><text start="2030.399" dur="5.041">other and we&apos;re able to you know measure</text><text start="2032.72" dur="4.799">our trust between each other like that</text><text start="2035.44" dur="4.4">is really hard on mainnet ethereum but i</text><text start="2037.519" dur="4.801">think it&apos;s it&apos;s a lot easier on an l2</text><text start="2039.84" dur="4.48">when those attestations are cheaper</text><text start="2042.32" dur="3.12">yeah totally are most of the builds or</text><text start="2044.32" dur="2.479">deployments that

most people learn by</text><text start="2736.4" dur="4.08">doing or are people visual learners like</text><text start="2738.4" dur="3.12">what you&apos;re an educator how do you what</text><text

don&apos;t know if i know</text><text start="2745.52" dur="4.0">the distribution amounts i do know that</text><text start="2747.68" dur="4.639">there are different learners right i</text><text start="2749.52" dur="5.04">know that for visual learners uh i made</text><text start="2752.319" dur="4.241">ethe.build and i have a lot of people</text><text start="2754.56" dur="3.84">reach out that</text><text start="2756.56" dur="4.799">like it resonated and it really helped</text><text start="2758.4" dur="4.719">them get over kind of like like tutorial</text><text start="2761.359" dur="3.361">hell or whatever right and and hopefully</text><text start="2763.119" dur="3.921">speedrun ethereum really gets people</text><text start="2764.72" dur="5.359">over tutorial hell but like you said if</text><text start="2767.04" dur="4.4">you&apos;re just staring at if if a book is</text><text start="2770.079" dur="3.201">just giving you all the answers and</text><text start="2771.44" dur="4.159">that&apos;s what you&apos;re staring at it makes</text><text start="2773.28" dur="4.72">sense and you get a good context of</text><text start="2775.599" dur="3.921">things but until you have to apply that</text><text start="2778.0" dur="4.24">and actually build something and you&apos;re</text><text start="2779.52" dur="4.24">challenged like it&apos;s it&apos;s not sinking in</text><text start="2782.24" dur="3.2">there&apos;s there&apos;s a moment on speedrun</text><text start="2783.76" dur="3.68">ethereum where you&apos;re on the first</text><text start="2785.44" dur="4.24">challenge and it&apos;s walking you through</text><text start="2787.44" dur="3.76">it and you get right to</text><text start="2789.68" dur="3.2">the point where you need to write a</text><text start="2791.2" dur="3.04">staking function you have to write the</text><text start="2792.88" dur="3.68">function and there&apos;s nothing there</text><text start="2794.24" dur="4.24">helping you other than write a function</text><text start="2796.56" dur="4.4">that allows people to stake and keep</text><text start="2798.48" dur="5.2">track in this mapping and at that moment</text><text start="2800.96" dur="4.639">your brain has to start creating and and</text><text start="2803.68" dur="3.439">if it doesn&apos;t then it&apos;s it&apos;s stuck and</text><text start="2805.599" dur="3.52">it&apos;s not and so i get everyone to that</text><text start="2807.119" dur="3.761">moment and push them as hard as i can to</text><text start="2809.119" dur="3.361">like make sure that blinking cursor</text><text start="2810.88" dur="4.16">starts typing stuff and they start</text><text start="2812.48" dur="4.56">building stuff i so different learners</text><text start="2815.04" dur="4.319">for sure if visual learners there&apos;s a</text><text start="2817.04" dur="4.88">lot of visual learners that learned</text><text start="2819.359" dur="4.401">uh kind of from ethe.build and they&apos;re</text><text start="2821.92" dur="4.56">able to get the concepts down i would</text><text start="2823.76" dur="4.4">say that scaffold eath is good for most</text><text start="2826.48" dur="4.0">there&apos;s there&apos;s a there&apos;s a couple folks</text><text start="2828.16" dur="3.28">that i&apos;ve had come through scaffold eth</text><text start="2830.48" dur="2.32">that</text><text start="2831.44" dur="3.84">were definitely like</text><text start="2832.8" dur="4.72">a different a different type of learner</text><text start="2835.28" dur="3.839">where they wanted more text they wanted</text><text start="2837.52" dur="3.76">more um</text><text start="2839.119" dur="3.761">they wanted it to be more verbose and i</text><text start="2841.28" dur="3.44">was like okay make that like make the</text><text start="2842.88" dur="3.92">verbose thing and we&apos;ll give that out</text><text start="2844.72" dur="4.96">also and so there&apos;s there&apos;s also like</text><text start="2846.8" dur="5.12">versions of the speed run that are you</text><text start="2849.68" dur="4.0">know like pages and pages of text that</text><text start="2851.92" dur="4.72">can help you like really like really</text><text start="2853.68" dur="5.679">explain things but the way i built it on</text><text start="2856.64" dur="5.12">purpose was like a quick one-liner you</text><text start="2859.359" dur="4.321">know build this to do this and watch out</text><text start="2861.76" dur="3.68">for this and that&apos;s all i say and</text><text start="2863.68" dur="3.76">hopefully like i kind of get out of the</text><text start="2865.44" dur="3.52">way and let them work on it so</text><text start="2867.44" dur="3.84">definitely different types of learners i</text><text start="2868.96" dur="5.92">don&apos;t know what the cross section is of</text><text start="2871.28" dur="4.799">shape rotators verse whatever but</text><text start="2874.88" dur="2.88">but uh</text><text start="2876.079" dur="3.52">like trying</text><text start="2877.76" dur="3.359">trying to get the right material in</text><text start="2879.599" dur="3.121">front of the right people takes time and</text><text start="2881.119" dur="4.401">you got to try a few things before you</text><text start="2882.72" dur="4.32">see what resonates with folks</text><text start="2885.52" dur="3.36">it&apos;s a meme i&apos;ve been heard a lot in a</text><text start="2887.04" dur="3.68">long time shape rotators versus words</text><text start="2888.88" dur="3.439">yeah but yeah i think it refers to</text><text start="2890.72" dur="3.2">visual learners people who can kind of</text><text start="2892.319" dur="2.961">like process things spatially in their</text><text start="2893.92" dur="4.159">mind versus</text><text start="2895.28" dur="4.24">verbal which is a slower circuit</text><text start="2898.079" dur="4.321">yeah and i think there</text><text start="2899.52" dur="4.96">are also some like kind of garbage</text><text start="2902.4" dur="3.679">memetic things along with that too that</text><text start="2904.48" dur="3.359">we&apos;re not supposed to be talking about</text><text start="2906.079" dur="3.28">so yeah maybe throw that meme out i</text><text start="2907.839" dur="2.401">think right</text><text start="2909.359" dur="2.561">um</text><text start="2910.24" dur="2.96">uh last question we only have like 10</text><text start="2911.92" dur="2.56">minutes left how do you keep your</text><text start="2913.2" dur="2.72">optimism alive like you&apos;re one of the</text><text start="2914.48" dur="3.52">most energetic people you&apos;ve been</text><text start="2915.92" dur="3.439">building through bear markets before how</text><text start="2918.0" dur="2.8">do you what makes you like wake up and</text><text start="2919.359" dur="2.561">want to do this</text><text start="2920.8" dur="3.039">every day</text><text start="2921.92" dur="3.76">you change a lot of diapers you do too</text><text start="2923.839" dur="3.441">probably</text><text start="2925.68" dur="3.439">there&apos;s nothing more fun than finally</text><text start="2927.28" dur="3.6">getting to my desk and getting to do</text><text start="2929.119" dur="4.161">work</text><text start="2930.88" dur="4.16">okay so so your bold case for if</text><text start="2933.28" dur="4.079">building out ethereum is that it&apos;s not</text><text start="2935.04" dur="3.12">changing a shitty diaper with your kids</text><text start="2937.359" dur="2.96">yeah</text><text start="2938.16" dur="4.8">yeah no i mean like these kids don&apos;t</text><text start="2940.319" dur="3.361">know austin</text><text start="2942.96" dur="2.8">no</text><text start="2943.68" dur="4.399">no and and probably good advice is well</text><text start="2945.76" dur="4.799">you know don&apos;t have kids build things</text><text start="2948.079" dur="4.641">it takes up so much of my time so</text><text start="2950.559" dur="4.961">optimism though like so much cool stuff</text><text start="2952.72" dur="3.68">comes out of the space if you if you are</text><text start="2955.52" dur="2.24">at all</text><text start="2956.4" dur="4.4">bearish</text><text start="2957.76" dur="5.28">on ethereum go to one ethereum hackathon</text><text start="2960.8" dur="3.44">and just catch the vibe go go from table</text><text start="2963.04" dur="2.96">to table asking people what they&apos;re</text><text

yeah yeah yeah yeah</text><text start="2972.96" dur="3.76">like yeah that was that was the virus</text><text start="2974.96" dur="3.599">that everyone got</text><text start="2976.72" dur="3.359">here</text><text start="2978.559" dur="3.04">you&apos;re right there is a lot of people</text><text start="2980.079" dur="2.961">who you know one thing i like about this</text><text start="2981.599" dur="3.041">space is that it&apos;s easy to get</text><text start="2983.04" dur="3.84">distraught about the the state of the</text><text start="2984.64" dur="4.959">world but when you

start="2990.8" dur="2.799">your values into your money it just</text><text start="2992.16" dur="2.72">makes you feel like you can be a hot</text><text start="2993.599" dur="2.801">knife through butter through some of</text><text start="2994.88" dur="2.56">society&apos;s problems and build something</text><text start="2996.4" dur="2.959">better and</text><text start="2997.44" dur="4.0">a lot of that is still potential energy</text><text start="2999.359" dur="4.081">you know i don&apos;t think that nfts or d5</text><text start="3001.44" dur="3.04">have really regenerated the world too</text><text start="3003.44" dur="2.56">much but there&apos;s a lot that we could</text><text start="3004.48" dur="3.04">build that could regenerate the world in</text><text start="3006.0" dur="2.88">the category of like quadratic funding</text><text start="3007.52" dur="3.28">and solving prisoners dilemmas and</text><text start="3008.88" dur="4.16">coordination failures so that&apos;s always</text><text start="3010.8" dur="4.72">the north star that that i&apos;m aiming for</text><text start="3013.04" dur="3.76">but it&apos;s it&apos;s nice to meet other people</text><text start="3015.52" dur="2.799">like i always felt like i was alone</text><text start="3016.8" dur="4.48">until i got into the ethereum space and</text><text start="3018.319" dur="6.0">i met people at the at youth denver and</text><text start="3021.28" dur="6.88">caught coronavirus but also the vibes</text><text start="3024.319" dur="6.881">i think uh amine&apos;s talk at mcon was</text><text start="3028.16" dur="4.399">really uh impactful to me in terms of</text><text start="3031.2" dur="3.44">thinking about</text><text start="3032.559" dur="3.601">you know what what what&apos;s the end game</text><text start="3034.64" dur="3.12">for ethereum what</text><text start="3036.16" dur="3.36">when we&apos;re thinking about mechanism</text><text start="3037.76" dur="3.599">design and we&apos;re thinking about building</text><text start="3039.52" dur="3.76">these games for people to play and we&apos;re</text><text start="3041.359" dur="3.2">thinking about game theory and</text><text start="3043.28" dur="3.76">coordination</text><text start="3044.559" dur="4.321">who who could who could be our biggest</text><text start="3047.04" dur="4.48">target audience right and when we start</text><text start="3048.88" dur="3.92">thinking about basically this this game</text><text start="3051.52" dur="3.36">theory playing out at like a</text><text start="3052.8" dur="5.279">nation-state level and writing smart</text><text start="3054.88" dur="5.36">contracts for nation-states to stake</text><text start="3058.079" dur="4.24">their military budget or something like</text><text start="3060.24" dur="4.16">that that starts to get of course like</text><text start="3062.319" dur="4.481">we&apos;re way out in the</text><text start="3064.4" dur="4.88">in the hopium area here</text><text start="3066.8" dur="3.68">and we&apos;re you know taking bong rips</text><text start="3069.28" dur="3.6">pretty hard when we&apos;re having these</text><text start="3070.48" dur="3.839">conversations but there is a there&apos;s a</text><text start="3072.88" dur="3.199">possibility there&apos;s a non-zero</text><text start="3074.319" dur="4.321">possibility that</text><text start="3076.079" dur="4.161">ethereum smart contracts are used at a</text><text start="3078.64" dur="3.6">nation-state level to create</text><text start="3080.24" dur="4.64">coordination that you couldn&apos;t create</text><text start="3082.24" dur="4.8">before like if you if you explain simple</text><text start="3084.88" dur="4.16">escrow to someone and you know alice and</text><text start="3087.04" dur="3.92">bob want us you know alice has some</text><text start="3089.04" dur="3.36">shoes and bob wants to buy those shoes</text><text start="3090.96" dur="3.119">you have to have this trusted third</text><text start="3092.4" dur="3.28">party in the middle that holds both the</text><text start="3094.079" dur="3.681">shoes because alice and bob don&apos;t trust</text><text start="3095.68" dur="4.08">each other and and when you start to</text><text start="3097.76" dur="4.079">scale that out and start to program that</text><text start="3099.76" dur="3.839">escrow and start to talk about</text><text start="3101.839" dur="3.601">nation states not being able to get</text><text start="3103.599" dur="3.76">along and what could be the thing that</text><text start="3105.44" dur="4.08">creates that coordination</text><text start="3107.359" dur="4.24">this for the first time in history we</text><text start="3109.52" dur="3.52">may have a platform that could do it</text><text start="3111.599" dur="3.601">obviously there&apos;s a lot of things that</text><text start="3113.04" dur="3.92">need to grow and get bigger and a lot of</text><text start="3115.2" dur="4.72">a lot more adoption that has to happen</text><text start="3116.96" dur="5.2">but that like that kind of thing really</text><text start="3119.92" dur="4.0">gets gets gets me goosebumpy like i</text><text start="3122.16" dur="3.199">think there&apos;s something there for sure i</text><text start="3123.92" dur="3.12">don&apos;t know if i&apos;ll be around to see it</text><text start="3125.359" dur="3.041">but i hope so</text><text start="3127.04" dur="3.12">yeah so you&apos;re saying it&apos;s all</text><text start="3128.4" dur="2.8">coordination is what i heard it always</text><text start="3130.16" dur="3.439">has been</text><text start="3131.2" dur="3.76">okay um yeah i think that you know just</text><text start="3133.599" dur="3.201">learning about the

coordinate</text><text start="3142.4" dur="4.24">as a game theoretic primitive</text><text start="3144.72" dur="4.08">made me see coordination failures in</text><text start="3146.64" dur="5.12">prisoner&apos;s dilemmas all over a society</text><text start="3148.8" dur="4.24">where if only we could coordinate and um</text><text start="3151.76" dur="2.24">then then we could solve them and i</text><text start="3153.04" dur="3.12">think that what what&apos;s cool about</text><text start="3154.0" dur="3.76">ethereum is that uh in just web 3 in</text><text start="3156.16"

dur="5.681">think that this like a smart contract</text><text start="3231.92" dur="5.439">platform a trust minimized environment</text><text start="3235.04" dur="4.96">where people can stake in and have you</text><text start="3237.359" dur="4.641">know juan binet talks about incentives</text><text start="3240.0" dur="4.24">create an incentive toward the behavior</text><text start="3242.0" dur="5.2">that you want to see happen one</text><text start="3244.24" dur="5.04">single incentive create it correctly and</text><text start="3247.2" dur="4.08">and make that move and then on the other</text><text start="3249.28" dur="4.0">side figure out what the next step is</text><text start="3251.28" dur="4.16">and create an incentive to drive people</text><text start="3253.28" dur="3.68">down that step and if we do that over</text><text start="3255.44" dur="3.04">and over again we start making the world</text><text start="3256.96" dur="3.68">a better place and i think that we&apos;re</text><text start="3258.48" dur="4.879">we&apos;re giving agency to folks that</text><text start="3260.64" dur="5.36">haven&apos;t had that agency before and and</text><text start="3263.359" dur="5.521">it&apos;s an it&apos;s a new time i think for</text><text start="3266.0" dur="5.76">for for builders and creators</text><text start="3268.88" dur="5.52">and hopefully even nation states we&apos;ll</text><text start="3271.76" dur="4.64">we&apos;ll see yeah so you&apos;re saying that web</text><text start="3274.4" dur="3.52">3 kind of makes people more agentic in</text><text start="3276.4" dur="3.28">that they can have an impact on the</text><text start="3277.92" dur="3.199">world uh</text><text start="3279.68" dur="2.879">whereas before you might be kind

start="3284.319" dur="4.0">about it but i guess you know the one</text><text start="3286.0" dur="4.4">area where i kind of get you know uh get</text><text start="3288.319" dur="4.321">off my opium and come up for</text><text start="3290.4" dur="3.36">for you know like a little bit of of</text><text start="3292.64" dur="2.479">just</text><text start="3293.76" dur="3.52">just like</text><text start="3295.119" dur="3.761">reality checking myself is that it feels</text><text start="3297.28" dur="4.64">like right now the space is more geared</text><text start="3298.88" dur="4.88">towards ponzinomics that uh like more</text><text start="3301.92" dur="3.679">capital rotates into the projects that</text><text start="3303.76" dur="3.68">have the most ponzinomics what would</text><text start="3305.599" dur="5.121">have to be true for capital rotate into</text><text start="3307.44" dur="5.28">projects that have the best impact um or</text><text start="3310.72" dur="5.04">are doing the best good for the world is</text><text start="3312.72" dur="5.76">there a class of long-term greedy</text><text start="3315.76" dur="5.039">investors and talent that can come in</text><text start="3318.48" dur="3.599">and work on impact owls or things that</text><text start="3320.799" dur="2.56">have that object level good for the</text><text start="3322.079" dur="2.161">world and like the example that i&apos;ll use</text><text start="3323.359" dur="3.121">is like</text><text start="3324.24" dur="4.319">you know like i was i was recording a</text><text start="3326.48" dur="3.76">podcast with uh biology this morning he</text><text start="3328.559" dur="3.201">was talking about how like commodities</text><text start="3330.24" dur="3.599">features like basically potatoes in the</text><text start="3331.76" dur="3.52">ground you can have people speculate on</text><text start="3333.839" dur="2.96">top of that but they&apos;re like speculating</text><text start="3335.28" dur="4.079">on the risk and that creates an actual</text><text start="3336.799" dur="4.721">function to the financial system in that</text><text start="3339.359" dur="4.161">like if a storm comes along and like</text><text start="3341.52" dur="3.36">kills all the potatoes i actually don&apos;t</text><text start="3343.52" dur="2.799">know how potatoes can be killed but like</text><text start="3344.88" dur="2.88">let&apos;s say there&apos;s some sort of risk with</text><text start="3346.319" dur="3.04">like a blight or something like that</text><text start="3347.76" dur="4.16">then like that financial engineering on</text><text start="3349.359" dur="4.321">top of that creates something for like</text><text start="3351.92" dur="4.0">risk management for the economy but like</text><text start="3353.68" dur="3.84">when it&apos;s yams like the actual like</text><text start="3355.92" dur="3.12">digital tokens that have no connection</text><text start="3357.52" dur="3.12">to the world and it&apos;s all like we&apos;re</text><text start="3359.04" dur="3.44">just breeding these like potatoes these</text><text start="3360.64" dur="3.04">digital potatoes that have no actual</text><text start="3362.48" dur="2.8">impact on the world like people can&apos;t</text><text start="3363.68" dur="3.36">eat a digital potato then it&apos;s not</text><text start="3365.28" dur="2.559">connected to anything so like how do we</text><text start="3367.04" dur="2.24">get</text><text start="3367.839" dur="2.881">how do we rotate into things that</text><text start="3369.28" dur="2.96">actually have an impact and are useful</text><text start="3370.72" dur="3.68">to people in their everyday lives in a</text><text start="3372.24" dur="3.599">way from ponzinomics do you think about</text><text start="3374.4" dur="3.36">that at all</text><text start="3375.839" dur="4.0">i think that&apos;s that&apos;s probably a little</text><text start="3377.76" dur="4.4">bit out of my wheelhouse i would say i&apos;m</text><text start="3379.839" dur="5.041">at least one level of abstraction below</text><text start="3382.16" dur="5.04">that and i&apos;m looking up to homies like</text><text start="3384.88" dur="5.04">vitalik and bigger bigger picture</text><text start="3387.2" dur="4.32">thinkers and you know when when they say</text><text start="3389.92" dur="3.6">hey we have a chance here if we could</text><text start="3391.52" dur="3.52">build this thing then i go build it yeah</text><text start="3393.52" dur="3.36">so i&apos;m hopeful for it but it&apos;s not</text><text start="3395.04" dur="3.6">something that i i don&apos;t play at that</text><text start="3396.88" dur="3.28">level i don&apos;t think but what do you tell</text><text start="3398.64" dur="4.0">the builders that like you&apos;re pied</text><text start="3400.16" dur="3.84">pipering into the ecosystem are you like</text><text start="3402.64" dur="2.8">you know here&apos;s a project that wants to</text><text start="3404.0" dur="3.359">hire you but just so you know it looks</text><text start="3405.44" dur="3.76">like it&apos;s kind of like a ponzi like you</text><text start="3407.359" dur="3.041">know like where do you draw the line for</text><text start="3409.2" dur="3.2">the people that you&apos;re that you&apos;re</text><text

dur="4.399">there&apos;s better chains that are</text><text start="3428.16" dur="4.159">more decentralized and decentralization</text><text start="3430.559" dur="3.921">is important here and you know you have</text><text start="3432.319" dur="4.161">to have the chat about decentralization</text><text start="3434.48" dur="3.68">a little bit i don&apos;t run into it too</text><text start="3436.48"
