dur="6.3">we are talking about hyperserts you can</text><text start="16.68" dur="6.0">think of hyper asserts as an nft that</text><text start="20.16" dur="4.92">acts as sort of a carbon credit but it</text><text start="22.68" dur="4.32">doesn&apos;t just work on the carbon credit</text><text start="25.08" dur="5.039">and carbon capture Vector it works on</text><text start="27.0" dur="5.099">any

start="71.7" dur="5.88">and the more impact they have the more</text><text start="74.82" dur="5.0">value they&apos;re able to capture if there</text><text start="77.58" dur="5.64">is by pressure on

dur="4.981">uh protocol Labs is just really really</text><text start="98.46" dur="5.64">smart really uh been a good partner in</text><text start="101.28" dur="5.28">developing hyperserts and there&apos;s a</text><text start="104.1" dur="6.059">pilot app available at hypersearch.xyz</text><text start="106.56" dur="5.519">so we&apos;re at a minimum viable product for</text><text start="110.159" dur="3.6">for at least one side of those</text><text start="112.079" dur="3.301">marketplaces and are starting to think</text><text start="113.759" dur="4.201">about how could this actually go into</text><text start="115.38" dur="4.559">the wild over the next quarters so if</text><text start="117.96" dur="3.659">you&apos;re interested in how do we align</text><text start="119.939" dur="3.781">incentives so that people can just work</text><text start="121.619" dur="4.14">for impact and get paid for that then</text><text start="123.72" dur="3.66">this episode is for you you we did an</text><text start="125.759" dur="3.301">episode a couple weeks ago with Legion</text><text start="127.38" dur="3.54">and Matthew freilic in which we talked</text><text start="129.06" dur="4.14">about making impact in investable or</text><text start="130.92" dur="4.38">purchasable or</text><text start="133.2" dur="3.899">um and and this is kind of an episode</text><text start="135.3" dur="4.439">that follows up with a tangible example</text><text start="137.099" dur="3.901">of how that could be done and I&apos;m just</text><text start="139.739" dur="2.821">really here for it what if we could</text><text start="141.0" dur="3.0">create a systemic incentive for people</text><text start="142.56" dur="3.179">to work on the public good and work on</text><text start="144.0" dur="3.12">the commons and get paid for it I think</text><text start="145.739" dur="3.781">hypersearch is a really interesting</text><text start="147.12" dur="4.08">primitive for making that happen but you</text><text start="149.52" dur="4.62">know this is a complicated technology</text><text start="151.2" dur="5.1">build out and if it if it is

the legitimacy of</text><text start="279.419" dur="5.701">hypersuits yeah and so so basically the</text><text start="282.479" dur="4.681">basic setup could be that just like some</text><text start="285.12" dur="3.66">people create impact some people fund</text><text start="287.16" dur="3.12">the impact either like Prospect if you</text><text start="288.78" dur="3.18">are retrospectively</text><text start="290.28" dur="3.96">um through a hypersert</text><text start="291.96" dur="4.92">um but it really becomes interesting if</text><text start="294.24" dur="5.76">you add kind of the function of an</text><text start="296.88" dur="6.42">evaluator because the evaluator would</text><text start="300.0" dur="5.1">um kind of specialize in evaluating</text><text start="303.3" dur="4.98">um an impact and I&apos;m thinking of like</text><text start="305.1" dur="7.02">that&apos;s probably like an impact evaluator</text><text start="308.28" dur="7.22">um just for a specific topic or like a</text><text start="312.12" dur="5.76">specific impact vector and then this</text><text start="315.5" dur="4.06">evaluator sends a signal to the</text><text start="317.88" dur="3.0">retrospective funder or to the funders</text><text start="319.56" dur="2.94">in general</text><text start="320.88" dur="4.2">um to</text><text start="322.5" dur="5.4">um about like was this work really</text><text start="325.08" dur="6.0">impactful what um how did we see over</text><text start="327.9" dur="6.48">time this impact and we can also submit</text><text start="331.08" dur="5.28">multiple evaluations over time</text><text start="334.38" dur="4.8">um to track if there was more and more</text><text start="336.36" dur="4.14">impact created from this work that has</text><text start="339.18" dur="4.44">been done because like sometimes you do</text><text start="340.5" dur="5.1">like work at one point in time but it</text><text start="343.62" dur="5.1">actually has impact over a long time</text><text start="345.6" dur="5.46">period and we can use evaluations</text><text start="348.72" dur="5.94">um over and over to really</text><text start="351.06" dur="5.88">um see and track the impact and then</text><text start="354.66" dur="4.74">um adjust the the rewards</text><text start="356.94" dur="4.74">um to the creators according to that and</text><text start="359.4" dur="6.12">they evaluators</text><text start="361.68" dur="5.04">um that can be like a full range of</text><text start="365.52" dur="7.619">um</text><text start="366.72" dur="9.539">of either people or mechanisms that are</text><text start="373.139" dur="5.581">basically used and sometimes we can just</text><text start="376.259" dur="4.621">like ask the beneficiaries of a public</text><text start="378.72" dur="4.08">good what they think really about the</text><text start="380.88" dur="4.02">impact and then the funder kind of kind</text><text start="382.8" dur="3.78">of listen to what what the beneficiaries</text><text start="384.9" dur="4.98">really says say</text><text start="386.58" dur="4.98">um but then sometimes it is more really</text><text start="389.88" dur="4.74">like something that experts have to</text><text start="391.56" dur="5.699">really look into very deeply because it</text><text start="394.62" dur="4.62">is maybe about like some</text><text start="397.259" dur="4.861">um like some technology that is not that</text><text start="399.24" dur="5.579">accessible to others so we kind of</text><text start="402.12" dur="5.22">create kind of a panel of experts that</text><text start="404.819" dur="3.741">look at it and ideally we would</text><text start="407.34" dur="4.079">um</text><text start="408.56" dur="5.5">commits to how we really evaluate that</text><text start="411.419" dur="6.06">impact and how we select the the experts</text><text start="414.06" dur="5.94">up front so that the expectations from</text><text start="417.479" dur="4.621">the projects are again kind of can be</text><text start="420.0" dur="3.96">formed and they can create like these</text><text start="422.1" dur="3.96">reliable expectations</text><text start="423.96" dur="3.54">um and then the impact evaluator can</text><text start="426.06" dur="3.359">also be</text><text start="427.5" dur="4.16">um just like a smart contract that like</text><text start="429.419" dur="5.881">looks at some data and automatically</text><text start="431.66" dur="5.259">then evaluates the the hyper cert or the</text><text start="435.3" dur="3.06">work that is described by the hypersuit</text><text start="436.919" dur="4.081">and</text><text start="438.36" dur="5.52">um that basically points to whenever we</text><text start="441.0" dur="4.62">create a hypersert we can also add the</text><text start="443.88" dur="5.219">functionality that there&apos;s either</text><text start="445.62" dur="7.019">already funding for a certain evaluation</text><text start="449.099" dur="5.521">mechanism or we can Define kind of a</text><text start="452.639" dur="4.441">smart contract that will automatically</text><text start="454.62" dur="5.82">evaluate this hyper cert later on</text><text start="457.08" dur="6.119">According to some some mechanism that we</text><text start="460.44" dur="4.08">specify up front and then the the</text><text start="463.199" dur="4.201">evaluation</text><text start="464.52" dur="5.28">um is points basically at the at the</text><text start="467.4" dur="4.44">hyper search um for all the</text><text start="469.8" dur="4.98">retrospective funders to actually see</text><text start="471.84" dur="5.88">and to observe so we create like Market</text><text start="474.78" dur="6.0">signals for the funders which are like</text><text start="477.72" dur="4.86">the most impactful public goods um which</text><text start="480.78" dur="4.319">should they actually</text><text start="482.58" dur="5.28">um uh purchase in this sense and reward</text><text start="485.099" dur="4.141">the the creators of of that hypersuit</text><text start="487.86" dur="5.52">and to the creator of the public good</text><text start="489.24" dur="7.62">and um that again then creates kind of a</text><text start="493.38" dur="6.42">reputation for certain evaluators so the</text><text start="496.86" dur="4.559">more reputable they they are the more</text><text start="499.8" dur="3.54">often they have actually been right in</text><text start="501.419" dur="2.701">in saying this is really impactful and</text><text start="503.34" dur="2.34">then</text><text start="504.12" dur="3.299">um later on it turned out to be</text><text start="505.68" dur="4.079">impactful and other</text><text start="507.419" dur="4.8">um evaluators agree with that so it&apos;s</text><text start="509.759" dur="4.681">really like a mechanism where</text><text start="512.219" dur="4.68">um we we build up trust in the system</text><text start="514.44" dur="5.279">for different evaluators</text><text start="516.899" dur="5.041">um and the trust is always</text><text start="519.719" dur="5.281">um kind of the the relevant trust is</text><text start="521.94" dur="5.28">from the funders to the um to the</text><text start="525.0" dur="4.38">evaluators so those evaluators who are</text><text start="527.22" dur="4.44">trusted by the funders they they have a</text><text start="529.38" dur="5.34">lot of influence about what which public</text><text start="531.66" dur="6.54">goods get funded and those evaluators</text><text start="534.72" dur="4.92">who like don&apos;t do a good job or they</text><text start="538.2" dur="3.36">just like say oh this was like</text><text start="539.64" dur="4.379">everything was really great</text><text start="541.56" dur="4.62">um they don&apos;t really provide a very</text><text start="544.019" dur="5.101">interesting signal for funders so</text><text start="546.18" dur="6.54">funders won&apos;t listen to them and</text><text start="549.12" dur="6.18">um they they have no influence on the uh</text><text start="552.72" dur="5.46">on the market here</text><text start="555.3" dur="4.32">um so that&apos;s and yeah like I have two</text><text start="558.18" dur="5.159">different thoughts on this uh because</text><text start="559.62" dur="4.74">like the the impact evaluators</text><text start="563.339" dur="4.381">um</text><text start="564.36" dur="5.4">when when they like it&apos;s it&apos;s a problem</text><text start="567.72" dur="4.38">that is currently when you look at the</text><text start="569.76" dur="4.86">the classic impact markets or like the</text><text start="572.1" dur="4.56">classic impact um sector</text><text start="574.62" dur="3.719">there is a problem that we don&apos;t see</text><text start="576.66" dur="5.28">actually a lot of negative evaluations</text><text start="578.339" dur="6.0">of impact like we don&apos;t see oh like a</text><text start="581.94" dur="3.899">project was funded but it was not the</text><text start="584.339" dur="2.521">most efficient way of spending that</text><text start="585.839" dur="2.581">money</text><text start="586.86" dur="4.08">um we don&apos;t see that because currently</text><text start="588.42" dur="5.039">neither the funders nor the project</text><text start="590.94" dur="5.76">creators really want to know if their</text><text start="593.459" dur="6.541">their resources or their time where like</text><text start="596.7" dur="5.88">not really used very efficiently and</text><text start="600.0" dur="5.04">that&apos;s why like an impact report most</text><text start="602.58" dur="4.68">often actually tells everyone hey you</text><text start="605.04" dur="5.64">did a great job and with with this</text><text start="607.26" dur="4.32">mechanism we really incentivize that we</text><text start="610.68" dur="3.24">have</text><text start="611.58" dur="5.04">um meaningful signals to the funders</text><text start="613.92" dur="4.859">because the funders have to decide based</text><text start="616.62" dur="4.08">on this information which</text><text start="618.779" dur="3.901">um hypersearch they want to buy and</text><text start="620.7" dur="6.12">based on which episodes they want to buy</text><text start="622.68" dur="7.08">that is again what they can then display</text><text start="626.82" dur="4.86">um for like on their website to</text><text start="629.76" dur="5.4">um to whoever gave them the the funding</text><text start="631.68" dur="6.54">in the first place or to to others if</text><text start="635.16" dur="5.04">it&apos;s a company to their customers or if</text><text start="638.22" dur="4.619">it&apos;s potentially also an individual who</text><text start="640.2" dur="3.66">funded the impact then they that you can</text><text start="642.839" dur="3.661">basically</text><text start="643.86" dur="3.78">um show those those high pressure to</text><text start="646.5" dur="2.94">actually show</text><text start="647.64" dur="3.9">um what you have done with like like</text><text start="649.44" dur="4.079">what kind of good you have caused with</text><text start="651.54" dur="4.2">with the funding that you have so in</text><text start="653.519" dur="4.38">that sense like hypersearch</text><text start="655.74" dur="4.56">um can turn or like that the idea when</text><text

is is is is is the</text><text start="718.44" dur="3.18">fact that we could have this diversity</text><text start="719.519" dur="4.141">of a market of evaluators and there can</text><text

and and I think that</text><text start="729.899" dur="3.481">that diversity is important because it</text><text start="731.579" dur="4.681">allows the system not to be captured</text><text start="733.38" dur="4.98">yeah and and it points to another thing</text><text start="736.26" dur="5.4">that we really want to build like an</text><text start="738.36" dur="5.94">open ecosystem where every player in the</text><text start="741.66" dur="5.28">ecosystem can optimize their own</text><text start="744.3" dur="4.8">function in the ecosystem so evaluators</text><text start="746.94" dur="4.98">get better and better and more efficient</text><text start="749.1" dur="5.46">in evaluating the impact funders get</text><text start="751.92" dur="6.02">more efficient in allocating their fund</text><text start="754.56" dur="6.42">funding and finding out who are the the</text><text start="757.94" dur="5.38">valuators to listen to and</text><text start="760.98" dur="5.58">um with those signals the project</text><text start="763.32" dur="4.92">creators and they they can also like</text><text start="766.56" dur="3.48">optimize their own function in the</text><text start="768.24" dur="4.32">system and that&apos;s how like the system</text><text start="770.04" dur="5.94">overall um gets better and better over</text><text start="772.56" dur="5.579">time and that is um why this is not like</text><text start="775.98" dur="4.2">thought of like oh we just like built</text><text start="778.139" dur="5.041">one system and then then it works but</text><text start="780.18" dur="4.8">more Building A Primitive on which</text><text start="783.18" dur="3.3">um different applications and different</text><text start="784.98" dur="4.32">evaluations</text><text start="786.48" dur="5.64">um Can can work and being can like also</text><text start="789.3" dur="4.26">different evaluators the other platforms</text><text start="792.12" dur="3.12">can be developed</text><text start="793.56" dur="3.839">um so that we get really this Dynamic</text><text start="795.24" dur="4.8">that everybody kind of improves their</text><text start="797.399" dur="4.38">own function of the system and that&apos;s</text><text start="800.04" dur="4.62">really like kind of the power of of</text><text start="801.779" dur="4.921">markets um that it&apos;s not uh Center</text><text start="804.66" dur="4.979">centrally controlled but like everybody</text><text start="806.7" dur="6.54">has incentives to contribute in their</text><text start="809.639" dur="5.601">own way to the system overall</text><text start="813.24" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="816.06" dur="5.16">yeah um I I mean I I think that this you</text><text start="819.959" dur="3.12">know clearly I think that this is</text><text start="821.22" dur="4.98">powerful uh you and I have been working</text><text start="823.079" dur="4.801">on this for uh about half of a year now</text><text start="826.2" dur="2.579">we&apos;re</text><text start="827.88" dur="2.399">um</text><text start="828.779" dur="2.941">where do you think you know one of the</text><text start="830.279" dur="2.941">questions I always get when I when I</text><text start="831.72" dur="3.359">explain this to people is where does the</text><text start="833.22" dur="4.2">buy pressure come from for these hyper</text><text start="835.079" dur="5.401">certs so people typically there&apos;s a</text><text start="837.42" dur="4.979">triple-sided Marketplace uh impact owls</text><text start="840.48" dur="2.46">are creating impact</text><text start="842.399" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="842.94" dur="4.74">people we think will be purchasing this</text><text start="845.519" dur="3.601">impact and creating buy pressure for it</text><text start="847.68" dur="3.24">and then you&apos;ve got the evaluators in</text><text start="849.12" dur="3.48">the middle and so once people sort of</text><text start="850.92" dur="3.24">understand the the architecture of the</text><text start="852.6" dur="4.08">evaluators the next thing they probe at</text><text start="854.16" dur="4.919">is where does the buy pressure for this</text><text start="856.68" dur="4.14">come from so uh any thoughts on that</text><text start="859.079" dur="4.741">side of the marketplace</text><text start="860.82" dur="6.84">yeah so like I think it&apos;s the difficulty</text><text start="863.82" dur="5.699">is to imagine how that that system like</text><text start="867.66" dur="4.14">suddenly is is bootstrapped and suddenly</text><text start="869.519" dur="4.081">exists I think like when we when we</text><text start="871.8" dur="2.4">think of a system where</text><text start="873.6" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="874.2" dur="3.9">retrospective funding became already a</text><text start="876.48" dur="5.099">norm and like it&apos;s just like the normal</text><text start="878.1" dur="6.0">thing to do for those institutions that</text><text start="881.579" dur="4.861">today already fund impact because like</text><text start="884.1" dur="5.28">that like we spent a lot of money</text><text start="886.44" dur="5.519">through governments foundations</text><text start="889.38" dur="5.04">um on um public goods we just say kind</text><text start="891.959" dur="4.861">of reallocate that and then also show</text><text start="894.42" dur="4.8">others how they can more efficiently</text><text start="896.82" dur="4.44">allocate this money so maybe there are</text><text start="899.22" dur="4.619">also like new funders coming into this</text><text start="901.26" dur="4.319">space so there&apos;s a world</text><text start="903.839" dur="3.901">um in which that is kind of just like</text><text start="905.579" dur="4.62">the normal thing that that happens but</text><text start="907.74" dur="4.5">the world or like the steps towards that</text><text start="910.199" dur="4.681">world I think that&apos;s the difficulty to</text><text start="912.24" dur="4.38">to imagine that and that&apos;s where</text><text start="914.88" dur="4.139">um I referred earlier to it a little bit</text><text start="916.62" dur="4.44">already but like it is uh let&apos;s start</text><text start="919.019" dur="2.82">with something like</text><text start="921.06" dur="3.36">um</text><text start="921.839" dur="5.521">price competitions so</text><text start="924.42" dur="6.419">um and we are currently thinking of</text><text start="927.36" dur="6.979">um partnering with vita Dao</text><text start="930.839" dur="6.3">um on the longevity price in order to</text><text start="934.339" dur="6.161">kind of use hyper certs in that system</text><text start="937.139" dur="6.961">so basically we we announce</text><text start="940.5" dur="6.48">um some kind of a a price on longevity</text><text start="944.1" dur="5.28">and um I mean the bad at our community</text><text start="946.98" dur="4.799">they um are working on that currently</text><text start="949.38" dur="4.56">already but then</text><text start="951.779" dur="5.401">um when we connect hyperswords with that</text><text start="953.94" dur="5.699">it is basically whenever this price is</text><text start="957.18" dur="5.339">actually then paid out then</text><text start="959.639" dur="6.181">um the retrospector funder so whoever</text><text start="962.519" dur="5.701">gave out the price they receive hyper</text><text start="965.82" dur="5.04">certs from the</text><text start="968.22" dur="4.44">um from the projects that kind of won</text><text start="970.86" dur="3.9">the the price competition that&apos;s just</text><text start="972.66" dur="5.7">like the first step where we have actual</text><text start="974.76" dur="6.06">retrospective funding so and then if we</text><text start="978.36" dur="4.5">um if we imagine that this doesn&apos;t</text><text start="980.82" dur="4.22">happen just once but that we have like a</text><text start="982.86" dur="4.919">lot of different price competitions</text><text start="985.04" dur="5.02">where they all run on the same system</text><text start="987.779" dur="5.221">with high pressure on the same primitive</text><text start="990.06" dur="4.26">so every project that works in a</text><text start="993.0" dur="4.5">specific sector</text><text start="994.32" dur="4.68">um kind of uses hypersearch in order to</text><text start="997.5" dur="3.36">to apply for different price</text><text start="999.0" dur="4.68">competitions then later on we can</text><text start="1000.86" dur="5.46">generalize this system where we don&apos;t</text><text start="1003.68" dur="4.5">need to actually announce</text><text start="1006.32" dur="4.8">um the the prices</text><text start="1008.18" dur="5.339">um as specific anymore but people just</text><text start="1011.12" dur="3.48">know that there will be retrospective</text><text start="1013.519" dur="2.94">funding</text><text start="1014.6" dur="4.799">um in the future so the buy pressure</text><text start="1016.459" dur="6.841">really comes here from from Thunders who</text><text start="1019.399" dur="3.901">get used to funding</text><text start="1023.72" dur="4.079">um funding like retrospectively instead</text><text start="1026.179" dur="3.421">of prospectively</text><text start="1027.799" dur="4.681">more or less with the money that they&apos;re</text><text start="1029.6" dur="5.04">currently already spending on on</text><text start="1032.48" dur="5.52">um creating impact but they realize that</text><text start="1034.64" dur="5.159">like if they do it afterwards they can</text><text start="1038.0" dur="4.199">allocate their funding much more</text><text start="1039.799" dur="3.481">efficiently than if they just like try</text><text start="1042.199" dur="3.661">to bet</text><text start="1043.28" dur="5.46">um on on different things in in the</text><text start="1045.86" dur="4.439">first place so because that without</text><text start="1048.74" dur="3.48">anything in the future they don&apos;t create</text><text start="1050.299" dur="4.441">any</text><text start="1052.22" dur="4.5">um any real incentives for the project</text><text start="1054.74" dur="4.14">after they get the funding to really</text><text start="1056.72" dur="5.28">create the impact so it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of a</text><text start="1058.88" dur="5.7">mindset shift for for funders and the</text><text start="1062.0" dur="4.44">way to get there is or like one way to</text><text start="1064.58" dur="5.219">get there is through different price</text><text start="1066.44" dur="5.34">competition and probably also for</text><text start="1069.799" dur="3.801">when when we just like work with some</text><text start="1071.78" dur="4.44">funders who are like open to to</text><text start="1073.6" dur="4.36">experimentation and</text><text start="1076.22" dur="4.56">um see kind of the value of the whole</text><text start="1077.96" dur="5.16">system that they just like start doing</text><text start="1080.78" dur="4.139">this and the more people actually start</text><text start="1083.12" dur="4.2">doing this the more other funders see</text><text start="1084.919" dur="4.021">like the value in uh funding it</text><text start="1087.32" dur="3.719">afterwards</text><text start="1088.94" dur="4.8">yeah it does it does feel like as the</text><text start="1091.039" dur="6.481">mechanism gains legitimacy it opens up</text><text start="1093.74" dur="6.0">the opportunity for new funders to come</text><text start="1097.52" dur="4.74">in you know some of the ideas that we&apos;ve</text><text start="1099.74" dur="4.02">that we&apos;ve talked about is well getcon</text><text start="1102.26" dur="3.0">grants is already doing six million</text><text start="1103.76" dur="5.82">dollars per quarter worth of funding for</text><text start="1105.26" dur="6.9">open source what if each of those was a</text><text start="1109.58" dur="5.339">each of those grants contributions was</text><text start="1112.16" dur="5.16">contributing to a hyper cert</text><text start="1114.919" dur="4.741">um what would it look like if we made</text><text start="1117.32" dur="3.84">hyper certs cool to collect such that</text><text start="1119.66" dur="4.08">you wanted to show them off on like your</text><text start="1121.16" dur="5.22">online dating profile uh you know going</text><text start="1123.74" dur="5.16">from like virtue signaling in web 2</text><text start="1126.38" dur="5.159">where there&apos;s no actual proof of virtue</text><text start="1128.9" dur="3.779">to proof of virtue in web 3 where you&apos;ve</text><text start="1131.539" dur="2.581">actually put your money where your mouth</text><text start="1132.679" dur="3.181">is and have purchased a certain amount</text><text start="1134.12" dur="3.059">of hyper certs</text><text start="1135.86" dur="4.74">um and then you look at organizations</text><text start="1137.179" dur="5.281">that have ESG goals that possibly a way</text><text start="1140.6" dur="3.24">of meeting their ESG goals could be to</text><text start="1142.46" dur="4.74">purchase hyper certs and that creates</text><text start="1143.84" dur="6.0">buy pressure and then the ultimate final</text><text start="1147.2" dur="5.099">sort of progenator or at least supposed</text><text start="1149.84" dur="4.68">to be progenator of the public good is</text><text start="1152.299" dur="4.921">governments so local state and National</text><text start="1154.52" dur="5.94">governments a lot of the funding that</text><text start="1157.22" dur="5.1">they use is or that they&apos;re supposed to</text><text start="1160.46" dur="3.78">be using their funding on is is creating</text><text start="1162.32" dur="3.84">public good and so what if there was a</text><text start="1164.24" dur="3.42">private Market of people who are already</text><text start="1166.16" dur="3.18">creating that public good in their</text><text start="1167.66" dur="3.96">Community you don&apos;t have to worry about</text><text start="1169.34" dur="4.079">the government administering and and</text><text start="1171.62" dur="3.299">creating that public good in communities</text><text start="1173.419" dur="3.541">anymore they can just purchase hyper</text><text start="1174.919" dur="4.081">certs in their local community providing</text><text start="1176.96" dur="3.839">a market-based incentive for people in</text><text start="1179.0" dur="3.36">their local community to get going so</text><text start="1180.799" dur="4.141">you know those are off the top of my</text><text start="1182.36" dur="5.4">head the the actors that I see I could</text><text start="1184.94" dur="5.46">see creating creating by pressure for</text><text start="1187.76" dur="3.96">for hyper certs and</text><text start="1190.4" dur="4.32">um I think that the future is quite</text><text start="1191.72" dur="4.74">bright if you can get if we can if you</text><text start="1194.72" dur="4.02">can align that that triple-sided</text><text start="1196.46" dur="5.94">Marketplace the impact creators the</text><text start="1198.74" dur="6.059">hyper asserts purchasers and then the</text><text start="1202.4" dur="4.26">impact evaluators it feels like</text><text start="1204.799" dur="4.981">bootstrapping those Network effects</text><text start="1206.66" dur="5.34">together is is going to be</text><text start="1209.78" dur="4.08">um kind of part of the challenge here so</text><text start="1212.0" dur="5.88">so what is the status of the project uh</text><text start="1213.86" dur="5.939">hypersearch study XYZ exists and uh what</text><text start="1217.88" dur="3.659">are the initial pilot projects that that</text><text start="1219.799" dur="4.021">we&apos;re going to run here</text><text start="1221.539" dur="3.781">um I mean like let me add like one one</text><text start="1223.82" dur="5.46">thing to to what you actually said</text><text start="1225.32" dur="6.18">because like I think there is</text><text start="1229.28" dur="4.56">like when we look at like the the public</text><text start="1231.5" dur="5.1">goods problem in general and we see it</text><text start="1233.84" dur="4.8">as uh a free write-up problem and</text><text start="1236.6" dur="3.54">wherever we can actually make</text><text start="1238.64" dur="4.74">transparent who are actually the free</text><text start="1240.14" dur="5.039">writers that can also like increase kind</text><text start="1243.38" dur="3.96">of the pressure on them so if we take</text><text start="1245.179" dur="4.921">the case of Open Source software we can</text><text start="1247.34" dur="6.12">actually kind of make more transparent</text><text start="1250.1" dur="5.579">who are the ones who use open source</text><text start="1253.46" dur="4.02">open source software Without Really uh</text><text start="1255.679" dur="3.961">paying for it so that is something that</text><text start="1257.48" dur="4.38">we can like not perfectly but</text><text start="1259.64" dur="5.76">approximately we can</text><text start="1261.86" dur="6.66">um we can actually see that and then if</text><text start="1265.4" dur="6.48">um those that that really</text><text start="1268.52" dur="6.12">um like you said they also buy Hyper</text><text start="1271.88" dur="4.32">search from the from the projects that</text><text start="1274.64" dur="4.02">created the the software that they&apos;re</text><text start="1276.2" dur="4.08">using then there&apos;s like some some kind</text><text start="1278.66" dur="4.5">of like let&apos;s let&apos;s call it a</text><text start="1280.28" dur="4.38">leaderboard of those for the the best</text><text start="1283.16" dur="3.66">contributors to the software they</text><text start="1284.66" dur="4.68">actually like where their their tools</text><text start="1286.82" dur="5.4">are based on and then you have a list of</text><text start="1289.34" dur="4.8">those companies that build software and</text><text start="1292.22" dur="4.5">have a business model</text><text start="1294.14" dur="4.56">um and use open source software but</text><text start="1296.72" dur="3.72">they&apos;re actually not paying for it and</text><text start="1298.7" dur="4.02">now we can actually see that because</text><text start="1300.44" dur="4.92">they are not purchasing um hyper search</text><text start="1302.72" dur="5.52">so we basically have like a list of of</text><text start="1305.36" dur="4.98">kind of the the the good the good uh</text><text start="1308.24" dur="4.319">companies and then the bad companies who</text><text start="1310.34" dur="4.56">kind of just like Free Ride On the Open</text><text start="1312.559" dur="4.201">Source software of of others</text><text start="1314.9" dur="3.6">um and that also then kind of creates</text><text start="1316.76" dur="3.72">the buy pressure so that&apos;s kind of the</text><text start="1318.5" dur="4.5">the thing where where we can also work</text><text start="1320.48" dur="5.46">on um kind of the the</text><text start="1323.0" dur="4.44">um the shaming aspect of public goods</text><text start="1325.94" dur="4.619">usage</text><text start="1327.44" dur="5.099">without paying for it</text><text start="1330.559" dur="3.541">um so there&apos;s like kind of like you&apos;re</text><text start="1332.539" dur="3.841">creating a set of the different actors</text><text start="1334.1" dur="3.9">in the system and based off of their</text><text start="1336.38" dur="2.94">hyper search balances you can see which</text><text start="1338.0" dur="3.96">ones are supporting the public good</text><text start="1339.32" dur="4.2">versus free writing on it yes and I mean</text><text start="1341.96" dur="4.079">it&apos;s it&apos;s similar to what happened in</text><text start="1343.52" dur="4.92">the carbon market right like we we know</text><text start="1346.039" dur="4.741">which companies actually produce uh more</text><text start="1348.44" dur="3.54">carbon so according to that they also</text><text start="1350.78" dur="3.06">should</text><text start="1351.98" dur="4.38">um buy more carbon credits so and like</text><text start="1353.84" dur="4.079">in in specific areas like open source</text><text start="1356.36" dur="5.16">software we can</text><text start="1357.919" dur="6.061">um try to create a similar system yes I</text><text start="1361.52" dur="4.44">I think that I I ask you a very loaded</text><text start="1363.98" dur="3.179">or I made a very long and loaded comment</text><text start="1365.96" dur="2.459">and then I asked you a question at the</text><text start="1367.159" dur="3.601">end of it and I think the question was</text><text start="1368.419" dur="5.401">what where are the pilots that hyper</text><text start="1370.76" dur="5.039">certs are being rolled out in uh in the</text><text start="1373.82" dur="4.08">next few months yes</text><text start="1375.799" dur="3.661">um so I mean one one thing is that we</text><text start="1377.9" dur="3.96">are developing kind of this this</text><text start="1379.46" dur="4.199">primitive and we developed that further</text><text start="1381.86" dur="4.38">um thinking currently how can we also</text><text start="1383.659" dur="4.801">make it easy for different projects also</text><text start="1386.24" dur="4.74">on different chains to to use uh the</text><text start="1388.46" dur="3.18">episode primitive and to still have kind</text><text start="1390.98" dur="3.059">of</text><text start="1391.64" dur="5.22">um one kind of public good space where</text><text start="1394.039" dur="4.321">all hyper States live in uh because like</text><text start="1396.86" dur="3.24">that&apos;s that&apos;s also something cool with</text><text start="1398.36" dur="4.199">the project that a lot of people are</text><text start="1400.1" dur="5.819">interested in in using hyper search in</text><text start="1402.559" dur="4.141">enjoining this um ecosystem that is just</text><text start="1405.919" dur="2.581">like</text><text start="1406.7" dur="4.26">um starting right now but like there&apos;s a</text><text start="1408.5" dur="4.02">lot of interest uh last week we had a</text><text start="1410.96" dur="4.5">community call with 10 different</text><text start="1412.52" dur="5.82">projects um just like pitching how their</text><text start="1415.46" dur="4.079">idea and how hyper search fits into</text><text start="1418.34" dur="2.64">their project</text><text start="1419.539" dur="4.5">um so that was kind of the the first</text><text start="1420.98" dur="5.46">hyperset Community called and</text><text start="1424.039" dur="5.041">um so we are developing this this uh</text><text start="1426.44" dur="5.219">this primitive further and then um we</text><text start="1429.08" dur="5.339">want to show that it works in a few</text><text start="1431.659" dur="4.861">different impact markets ourselves</text><text start="1434.419" dur="4.5">um and I already mentioned</text><text start="1436.52" dur="3.899">um the potential cooperation with the</text><text start="1438.919" dur="3.601">longevity price</text><text start="1440.419" dur="3.781">um so running a price competition with</text><text start="1442.52" dur="6.0">Hyper certs</text><text start="1444.2" dur="7.32">um uh second is that and you refer to it</text><text start="1448.52" dur="6.96">a little bit already the like can we</text><text start="1451.52" dur="7.38">attach kind of a hypersearch to the git</text><text start="1455.48" dur="5.88">coin grants protocol so whenever we</text><text start="1458.9" dur="6.12">actually have a funding round on um on</text><text start="1461.36" dur="5.04">bitcoin the funders can receive hyper</text><text start="1465.02" dur="3.24">certs</text><text start="1466.4" dur="5.58">um or like get awarded High research</text><text start="1468.26" dur="5.159">from the projects that get funded and</text><text start="1471.98" dur="3.6">um they are more concretely we are</text><text start="1473.419" dur="5.401">thinking about just running a pilot</text><text start="1475.58" dur="5.4">early 2023 on</text><text start="1478.82" dur="5.04">um with like 10 projects in a specific</text><text start="1480.98" dur="6.12">vertical in open source software looking</text><text start="1483.86" dur="5.46">back on their impact that they had in</text><text start="1487.1" dur="3.66">2022 and</text><text start="1489.32" dur="4.44">um so running like a retrospective</text><text start="1490.76" dur="6.06">funding round on git coin</text><text start="1493.76" dur="6.24">um and then whoever participates gets</text><text start="1496.82" dur="4.62">actually hyper certs um awarded from the</text><text start="1500.0" dur="3.659">projects</text><text start="1501.44" dur="4.92">um and so that is kind of like a test</text><text start="1503.659" dur="5.821">run to make this really like a module</text><text start="1506.36" dur="6.12">that anybody who runs a grants around</text><text start="1509.48" dur="4.92">with the new grants protocol</text><text start="1512.48" dur="3.84">um that they can just like flip on a</text><text start="1514.4" dur="3.54">switch off like yes I want to like issue</text><text start="1516.32" dur="4.08">a hyper search</text><text start="1517.94" dur="4.44">um with with my projects for the funders</text><text start="1520.4" dur="4.56">that support me either like</text><text start="1522.38" dur="5.159">prospectively or retrospectively</text><text start="1524.96" dur="4.86">um and then we also look at how can we</text><text start="1527.539" dur="5.161">use hypersearch in our own ecosystem at</text><text start="1529.82" dur="5.4">protocol Labs how can we use that in in</text><text start="1532.7" dur="5.28">combination uh with funding in our</text><text start="1535.22" dur="5.339">ecosystem if that is like ipfs or</text><text start="1537.98" dur="4.799">firecorn or the other projects and how</text><text start="1540.559" dur="4.261">can we uh because like we have done</text><text start="1542.779" dur="4.321">retrospective funding already but um</text><text start="1544.82" dur="5.52">haven&apos;t used um hypersets as a primitive</text><text start="1547.1" dur="5.579">yet but like if we can add that and then</text><text start="1550.34" dur="4.319">also track in our own ecosystem the</text><text start="1552.679" dur="4.62">public goods that that we fund and then</text><text start="1554.659" dur="5.461">also invite other funders who are also</text><text start="1557.299" dur="5.821">interested in funding some of uh that</text><text start="1560.12" dur="5.76">technology and kind of combining um our</text><text start="1563.12" dur="4.86">strength and uh funding funding open</text><text start="1565.88" dur="6.72">source software in in our own ecosystem</text><text start="1567.98"

pretty good</text><text start="1817.22" dur="3.12">um overview I believe</text><text start="1819.679" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="1820.34" dur="5.52">yeah I think we get we get through some</text><text start="1823.399" dur="4.081">of the benefits some of the like what</text><text start="1825.86" dur="3.0">does it what does it really an</text><text start="1827.48" dur="4.199">interoperable</text><text start="1828.86" dur="4.799">um hypersearch system look like</text><text start="1831.679" dur="3.901">um the different roles of the the actors</text><text start="1833.659" dur="3.24">who covered that</text><text start="1835.58" dur="3.38">um so</text><text start="1836.899" dur="3.961">um and the the practicalities so yeah</text><text start="1838.96" dur="4.18">I&apos;ve got one</text><text start="1840.86" dur="4.559">um in a world in which hyperserts is</text><text start="1843.14" dur="4.2">maximally successful what does that</text><text start="1845.419" dur="6.061">world look like like take me to it&apos;s</text><text start="1847.34" dur="6.719">2022 right now so let&apos;s say 2032 uh</text><text start="1851.48" dur="4.86">there&apos;s a deeply liquid</text><text start="1854.059" dur="4.681">a set of hyper certs that are being</text><text start="1856.34" dur="4.74">purchased and issued uh every day or</text><text start="1858.74" dur="3.72">every week and how does what is the</text><text start="1861.08" dur="3.36">world in which hypersearch is maximally</text><text start="1862.46" dur="4.8">successful look like</text><text start="1864.44" dur="5.58">um so that&apos;s that&apos;s a world where</text><text start="1867.26" dur="4.98">basically like all the talent that like</text><text start="1870.02" dur="4.86">today is I mean I don&apos;t want to say</text><text start="1872.24" dur="4.5">waste it but to some extent waste it on</text><text start="1874.88" dur="4.08">a lot of products that the world</text><text start="1876.74" dur="4.38">actually doesn&apos;t really need</text><text start="1878.96" dur="4.16">um all that Talent is really focused on</text><text start="1881.12" dur="6.48">the most impactful work that they can do</text><text start="1883.12" dur="6.76">and this this is possible because</text><text start="1887.6" dur="4.439">um they know that they get rewarded for</text><text start="1889.88" dur="3.48">this work if they are successful</text><text start="1892.039" dur="3.841">um so and that is kind of the function</text><text start="1893.36" dur="4.199">that hypersearch play here so</text><text start="1895.88" dur="3.06">um all all the people who like want to</text><text start="1897.559" dur="3.961">start new things</text><text start="1898.94" dur="5.219">um they they are not thinking about</text><text start="1901.52" dur="5.22">um the specific</text><text start="1904.159" dur="5.52">um like classical business model</text><text start="1906.74" dur="4.98">um but they think about impact but in a</text><text start="1909.679" dur="5.421">very similar way so they they are</text><text start="1911.72" dur="6.48">thinking about what is it that will</text><text start="1915.1" dur="5.38">maximize the impact that I can have in a</text><text start="1918.2" dur="5.579">specific area because that is exactly</text><text start="1920.48" dur="6.72">the same as what is it that will get me</text><text start="1923.779" dur="5.581">like uh a retrospective reward in the</text><text start="1927.2" dur="5.4">future so those things those two</text><text start="1929.36" dur="5.16">questions are now aligned and kind of</text><text start="1932.6" dur="4.26">entrepreneurs social entrepreneurs and</text><text start="1934.52" dur="4.98">entrepreneurs are actually now more or</text><text start="1936.86" dur="5.4">less the same thing so we don&apos;t have</text><text start="1939.5" dur="4.32">um that some people are like for profit</text><text start="1942.26" dur="3.899">entrepreneurs and others are social</text><text start="1943.82" dur="3.3">entrepreneurs these are just like fully</text><text start="1946.159" dur="3.661">aligned</text><text start="1947.12" dur="5.4">um and that is kind of the the status of</text><text start="1949.82" dur="4.56">kind of more the entrepreneur side but</text><text start="1952.52" dur="5.159">then there exists</text><text start="1954.38" dur="6.48">um a lot of like impact hours and other</text><text start="1957.679" dur="5.701">organizations that just like found found</text><text start="1960.86" dur="5.939">a good way to recurringly produce impact</text><text start="1963.38" dur="5.76">and they found like a sustainable model</text><text start="1966.799" dur="4.441">to to finance that through hypersearch</text><text start="1969.14" dur="4.2">because they over and over produce</text><text start="1971.24" dur="5.819">impact and</text><text start="1973.34" dur="6.78">um funders will then reward them for the</text><text start="1977.059" dur="6.061">securing impact so they they built</text><text start="1980.12" dur="5.46">um then also scalable models for this</text><text start="1983.12" dur="5.1">impact and it&apos;s not just like by project</text><text start="1985.58" dur="4.319">by project basis but they can build</text><text start="1988.22" dur="3.959">large</text><text start="1989.899" dur="5.221">scale organizations that become really</text><text start="1992.179" dur="4.88">efficient in providing this this impact</text><text start="1995.12" dur="4.32">and get</text><text start="1997.059" dur="4.181">rewarded for that impact</text><text start="1999.44" dur="4.8">yeah one of the things that&apos;s really</text><text start="2001.24" dur="4.2">deeply cool about a lot of well one of</text><text start="2004.24" dur="2.64">the themes I guess I&apos;d say I&apos;ll be</text><text start="2005.44" dur="3.119">seeing on the green pill podcast is like</text><text start="2006.88" dur="3.779">how can we provide a systemic incentive</text><text start="2008.559" dur="4.74">for people to work on the commons and on</text><text start="2010.659" dur="4.081">public goods and instead of have to work</text><text start="2013.299" dur="2.941">on their own private goods and I think</text><text start="2014.74" dur="4.26">one of the things that really excites me</text><text start="2016.24" dur="4.319">about hyperserts is that it closes the</text><text start="2019.0" dur="3.24">gap between value created and value</text><text start="2020.559" dur="2.46">captured for entrepreneurs as an</text><text start="2022.24" dur="2.4">entrepreneur you have to worry about</text><text start="2023.019" dur="3.0">capturing value so that you can pay your</text><text start="2024.64" dur="3.539">staff so you can pay your bills so you</text><text start="2026.019" dur="3.481">can continue living and if you could</text><text start="2028.179" dur="3.6">just be rewarded for the value you</text><text start="2029.5" dur="5.039">create then that&apos;s much different than</text><text start="2031.779" dur="4.801">only the value you captured and you know</text><text start="2034.539" dur="3.601">once that systemic incentive alignment</text><text start="2036.58" dur="3.78">is handled you can you can take the</text><text start="2038.14" dur="5.06">world&apos;s talent and all of the amazing</text><text start="2040.36" dur="6.24">beautiful uh</text><text start="2043.2" dur="5.139">resources and and talented individuals</text><text start="2046.6" dur="3.18">in the world and you can reorient them</text><text start="2048.339" dur="3.361">towards working on the most in problem</text><text start="2049.78" dur="3.54">important problems in the world so it</text><text start="2051.7" dur="3.899">feels like a systemic incentive change</text><text start="2053.32" dur="4.44">and you know</text><text start="2055.599" dur="3.721">um I I&apos;m just really I&apos;m just really</text><text start="2057.76" dur="4.2">excited to see where this goes I think</text><text start="2059.32" dur="4.5">that there&apos;s uh there&apos;s a there&apos;s</text><text start="2061.96" dur="4.56">there&apos;s a lot of upside to getting this</text><text start="2063.82" dur="4.26">right but it&apos;s going to be hard and uh</text><text start="2066.52" dur="3.359">and I hope to have you back in a year or</text><text start="2068.08" dur="4.319">two and and we can compare and contrast</text><text start="2069.879" dur="4.5">how uh how things have gone</text><text start="2072.399" dur="3.841">yeah and and I mean that&apos;s an</text><text start="2074.379" dur="3.96">interesting thing that the project in</text><text start="2076.24" dur="4.98">itself is kind of like</text><text start="2078.339" dur="5.941">a high potential public good because it</text><text start="2081.22" dur="5.639">there is of course like some kind of a</text><text start="2084.28" dur="3.72">um uncertainty of this like how we</text><text start="2086.859" dur="2.641">really</text><text start="2088.0" dur="3.359">um implement this</text><text start="2089.5" dur="3.899">um but if it works there&apos;s a really like</text><text start="2091.359" dur="3.661">a high high potential</text><text start="2093.399" dur="4.081">um upside</text><text start="2095.02" dur="3.48">um for a lot of other projects um to</text><text start="2097.48" dur="1.98">build</text><text start="2098.5" dur="3.839">um on this</text><text start="2099.46" dur="5.04">yeah are you saying that we should issue</text><text start="2102.339" dur="3.721">hyper certs to track the build out of</text><text start="2104.5" dur="3.599">hypersearch so that we can have more</text><text start="2106.06" dur="4.74">rewards for building hyperserts I mean</text><text start="2108.099" dur="5.041">the nice thing is that uh currently we</text><text start="2110.8" dur="4.319">don&apos;t need to do that and um I think</text><text start="2113.14" dur="4.26">it&apos;s also like we want to produce this</text><text start="2115.119" dur="4.321">as a public good to like to get this</text><text start="2117.4" dur="3.36">started and then other people building</text><text start="2119.44" dur="2.52">on top of that</text><text start="2120.76" dur="3.96">um so</text><text start="2121.96" dur="5.82">um we ourselves don&apos;t need to to get</text><text start="2124.72" dur="6.119">retrospective rewards for building this</text><text start="2127.78" dur="5.16">um so we like this is kind of our public</text><text start="2130.839" dur="4.26">good that we are giving to the world</text><text start="2132.94" dur="3.0">um and then later on</text><text start="2135.099" dur="2.881">um</text><text start="2135.94" dur="4.56">uh if you want to like see what what</text><text start="2137.98" dur="4.8">kind of impact that really creates</text><text start="2140.5" dur="3.18">yeah I love that</text><text start="2142.78" dur="3.38">um you know and while we&apos;re talking</text><text start="2143.68" dur="4.74">about the build out of the</text><text start="2146.16" dur="3.88">hypersearch.xyz platform I think I want</text><text start="2148.42" dur="3.0">to give a
