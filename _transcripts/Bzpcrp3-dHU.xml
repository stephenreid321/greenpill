pot today we</text><text start="7.799" dur="5.46">have Ron the founder of audience</text><text start="10.44" dur="6.0">audience is a fully decentralized music</text><text start="13.259" dur="5.461">platform so for listeners it is a open</text><text start="16.44" dur="5.82">source forkable protocol that allows you</text><text start="18.72" dur="5.46">to discover and to listen and support uh</text><text start="22.26" dur="4.08">musical artists and if you&apos;re an artist</text><text start="24.18" dur="4.38">then it&apos;s a way of building your</text><text start="26.34" dur="4.859">audience and engaging with fans</text><text start="28.56" dur="4.499">identifying the most important fans for</text><text start="31.199" dur="3.421">you and just generally building your</text><text start="33.059" dur="3.361">music career and so we talk a little bit</text><text start="34.62" dur="3.72">in this episode about the history of the</text><text start="36.42" dur="3.24">music industry how we&apos;ve moved from</text><text start="38.34" dur="2.879">these Central intermediaries that</text><text start="39.66" dur="3.96">extract a lot of value to fully</text><text start="41.219" dur="4.081">decentralized open source protocols that</text><text start="43.62" dur="4.68">are going to uh create a better</text><text start="45.3" dur="4.98">experience for both listeners and for</text><text start="48.3" dur="5.16">artists then we talk about kind of the</text><text start="50.28" dur="7.02">fun of having an open data set</text><text start="53.46" dur="5.279">um in Ron&apos;s case uh with audios and the</text><text start="57.3" dur="3.3">musical data set of what people are</text><text start="58.739" dur="4.14">listening to and with with my case</text><text start="60.6" dur="3.599">having the experience of git coin what</text><text start="62.879" dur="2.401">are the things that people are funding</text><text start="64.199" dur="2.761">and what are the thing things that you</text><text start="65.28" dur="4.019">can discover when you&apos;ve got an open</text><text start="66.96" dur="4.62">data set and open source algorithms that</text><text start="69.299" dur="4.801">allows people to curate the projects</text><text start="71.58" dur="4.2">that they care about in both things so</text><text start="74.1" dur="3.6">um you know in another feature of</text><text start="75.78" dur="3.54">audience that I think is important is</text><text start="77.7" dur="4.02">that it&apos;s a decentralized music platform</text><text start="79.32" dur="3.78">so the rules can&apos;t be changed on you as</text><text start="81.72" dur="3.24">an artist so I think that&apos;s really</text><text start="83.1" dur="4.14">important uh especially if you look at</text><text start="84.96" dur="5.699">the history of musical intermediaries</text><text start="87.24" dur="4.86">basically taking 90 of The Upside in</text><text start="90.659" dur="3.78">your musical career if you&apos;re an artist</text><text start="92.1" dur="5.04">and um you know if you&apos;re a listener</text><text start="94.439" dur="4.381">only routing you the the artists where</text><text start="97.14" dur="3.6">where they have the most Financial</text><text start="98.82" dur="4.14">upside and not the ones that are</text><text start="100.74" dur="5.0">according to your taste so</text><text start="102.96" dur="5.64">basically discovering and and and</text><text start="105.74" dur="4.54">cataloging the opportunity space of</text><text start="108.6" dur="4.26">creating a decentralized music platform</text><text start="110.28" dur="4.019">with with Ron from audios on this</text><text start="112.86" dur="4.86">episode and I think this is a really</text><text start="114.299" dur="6.661">regen episode because art and creative</text><text start="117.72" dur="5.46">work is is is something that a lot of us</text><text start="120.96" dur="4.619">in this industry have a lot of familiar</text><text start="123.18" dur="4.619">with familiarity with it&apos;s some the way</text><text start="125.579" dur="3.54">a lot of us pay our bills and it&apos;s just</text><text start="127.799" dur="2.761">so important to get the right art in</text><text start="129.119" dur="3.001">front of the right people and to do it</text><text start="130.56" dur="3.84">in a way in which the intermediaries</text><text start="132.12" dur="4.199">can&apos;t take all the money so um creating</text><text start="134.4" dur="3.479">a more green pilled regen world if</text><text start="136.319" dur="3.301">you&apos;re an artist or if you&apos;re a listener</text><text start="137.879" dur="3.421">is kind of one of the

were chatting at massari</text><text start="271.38" dur="5.58">mainnet and got to talking about your</text><text start="273.72" dur="5.4">work at audios uh so can you can you tee</text><text start="276.96" dur="3.42">us off by telling us about audios</text><text start="279.12" dur="4.019">totally</text><text start="280.38" dur="4.92">um so so at a super high level audience</text><text start="283.139" dur="4.441">is a music community and Discovery</text><text start="285.3" dur="5.94">platform that uh puts the artist in</text><text start="287.58" dur="5.58">control and uh that uh uh puts the</text><text start="291.24" dur="4.679">artist in control is really what we see</text><text start="293.16" dur="5.7">the key difference between uh you know</text><text start="295.919" dur="5.521">this this way of uh sharing content</text><text start="298.86" dur="5.64">building community and and a lot of the</text><text start="301.44" dur="4.979">uh tools that have sort of preceded us</text><text start="304.5" dur="3.78">um and yeah the way the way we achieve</text><text start="306.419" dur="4.741">that&apos;s by being fully decentralized so</text><text start="308.28" dur="5.88">there&apos;s a network of uh node operators</text><text start="311.16" dur="5.64">software Engineers artists fans that</text><text start="314.16" dur="5.34">together cooperatively</text><text start="316.8" dur="4.619">um uh uh operating this network for the</text><text start="319.5" dur="4.32">benefit of of all the folks that use it</text><text start="321.419" dur="4.261">but um you know also in in a lot of</text><text start="323.82" dur="3.659">cases because there are ways for them to</text><text start="325.68" dur="4.5">uh earn revenue from from the</text><text start="327.479" dur="5.341">contributions that they&apos;re making so</text><text start="330.18" dur="4.5">um so uh so yeah that&apos;s that&apos;s it at uh</text><text start="332.82" dur="4.68">high level serving about</text><text start="334.68" dur="5.64">um six to seven million users a month uh</text><text start="337.5" dur="4.86">uh these days and around 2 250 000</text><text start="340.32" dur="5.159">artists</text><text start="342.36" dur="5.64">wow that&apos;s quite a lot of scale for a</text><text start="345.479" dur="4.56">non-technical community</text><text start="348.0" dur="5.58">um and I&apos;m really excited about this</text><text start="350.039" dur="5.521">design space because it feels like</text><text start="353.58" dur="3.899">um artists and creative people have</text><text start="355.56" dur="3.479">traditionally had like the boot of a</text><text start="357.479" dur="4.201">centralized intermediary like a record</text><text start="359.039" dur="5.401">label on their neck and extracting as</text><text start="361.68" dur="4.56">much profits as as possible and it feels</text><text start="364.44" dur="4.62">like you know for thinking that web 3 is</text><text start="366.24" dur="4.38">for removing intermediaries and and</text><text start="369.06" dur="3.359">channeling more value to the people who</text><text start="370.62" dur="4.38">are creating then this just feels like a</text><text start="372.419" dur="4.981">really fruitful Community to start I&apos;m</text><text start="375.0" dur="3.84">curious if if that&apos;s your motivation in</text><text start="377.4" dur="3.66">in any way shape and form or if you have</text><text start="378.84" dur="5.579">any comments on that observation</text><text start="381.06" dur="4.8">yeah I think that&apos;s uh uh uh that&apos;s</text><text start="384.419" dur="3.541">definitely our motivation but it&apos;s</text><text start="385.86" dur="5.279">actually kind of a I I guess there&apos;s</text><text start="387.96" dur="6.0">even a a super ordinate problem to those</text><text start="391.139" dur="4.141">uh specific symptoms here which I I</text><text start="393.96" dur="4.98">think is that</text><text start="395.28" dur="6.66">um uh uh creators in music have no</text><text start="398.94" dur="6.12">control of Their audience and no agency</text><text start="401.94" dur="6.12">over how they access that audience what</text><text start="405.06" dur="5.04">they do with them how they&apos;re uh able to</text><text start="408.06" dur="5.16">charge them for things</text><text start="410.1" dur="5.939">um uh uh the uh distribution channels</text><text start="413.22" dur="7.319">that exist today are um very opinionated</text><text start="416.039" dur="6.901">about those uh uh about those things and</text><text start="420.539" dur="4.321">um oftentimes those uh opinionated</text><text start="422.94" dur="5.22">choices that have been made</text><text start="424.86" dur="5.88">um benefit a certain group of uh uh kind</text><text start="428.16" dur="4.979">of incumbent players over the um the up</text><text start="430.74" dur="5.0">and coming in the new so</text><text start="433.139" dur="2.601">um so yeah</text><text start="436.62" dur="6.18">beautiful well you know um I I I I&apos;d be</text><text start="440.88" dur="5.099">curious what the most interesting trends</text><text start="442.8" dur="6.299">that you&apos;re seeing on audios are and um</text><text start="445.979" dur="5.041">exactly uh you know not only in terms of</text><text start="449.099" dur="3.54">like the music that is hosted there but</text><text start="451.02" dur="4.38">in terms of the software that you&apos;re</text><text start="452.639" dur="4.56">developing in order to uh coordinate a</text><text start="455.4" dur="4.98">collective intelligence of peer-to-peer</text><text start="457.199" dur="4.681">group of listeners with uh with with the</text><text start="460.38" dur="4.02">artist so what are the most interesting</text><text start="461.88" dur="5.099">trends that you&apos;re seeing on audios</text><text start="464.4" dur="4.32">oh what a great question man</text><text start="466.979" dur="4.56">um so uh I think there are a few</text><text start="468.72" dur="5.819">different a few different categories of</text><text start="471.539" dur="6.66">uh uh like I don&apos;t know I guess what I&apos;d</text><text start="474.539" dur="6.06">really in in one case uh uh you know</text><text start="478.199" dur="4.381">Trends in in others like emergent</text><text start="480.599" dur="5.22">Behavior things that that people are</text><text start="482.58" dur="6.3">doing here that um uh I don&apos;t know like</text><text start="485.819" dur="5.461">we never as uh the folks who built the</text><text start="488.88" dur="4.379">first uh the first version of of this</text><text start="491.28" dur="4.199">like didn&apos;t anticipate people would do</text><text start="493.259" dur="4.021">but it&apos;s like it&apos;s exciting to see right</text><text start="495.479" dur="4.801">that&apos;s that&apos;s like the whole the whole</text><text start="497.28" dur="4.74">uh point of you know or the main point</text><text start="500.28" dur="4.979">of building in this way right is that</text><text start="502.02" dur="5.459">like uh uh you as as the initial</text><text start="505.259" dur="5.101">Builders of the thing don&apos;t always know</text><text start="507.479" dur="5.161">exactly uh you know what what the best</text><text start="510.36" dur="5.28">manifestations of of certain Behavior</text><text start="512.64" dur="5.519">patterns and things are but um but yeah</text><text start="515.64" dur="4.86">I think the uh the biggest Trends we&apos;re</text><text start="518.159" dur="4.68">seeing are</text><text start="520.5" dur="3.719">um really around I guess what I would</text><text start="522.839" dur="5.161">call uh</text><text start="524.219" dur="7.501">superfan engagement so being able to</text><text start="528.0" dur="5.279">identify segment and uh ultimately</text><text start="531.72" dur="5.22">charge</text><text start="533.279" dur="6.481">um uh uh directly like a smaller</text><text start="536.94" dur="4.98">percentage of your total fan base but</text><text start="539.76" dur="5.34">the folks who are you know more rabid</text><text start="541.92" dur="5.76">more excited more engaged</text><text start="545.1" dur="4.859">um there&apos;s uh uh I think that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="547.68" dur="5.88">like the biggest not just for audience</text><text start="549.959" dur="6.421">but for for web3 music broadly</text><text start="553.56" dur="4.32">um this idea that uh you know not all</text><text start="556.38" dur="3.42">fans are worth</text><text start="557.88" dur="3.36">um the same amount to you as as a</text><text start="559.8" dur="3.42">Creator right</text><text start="561.24" dur="4.98">um and if you can provide a</text><text start="563.22" dur="6.0">differentiated experience to</text><text start="566.22" dur="4.799">um you know folks who are willing to uh</text><text start="569.22" dur="3.6">uh to pay for it</text><text start="571.019" dur="4.201">um you know there&apos;s there&apos;s a lot a lot</text><text start="572.82" dur="5.04">more uh a lot more money potentially to</text><text start="575.22" dur="5.58">be made and ultimately there are more</text><text start="577.86" dur="5.7">paths to you as a Creator being able to</text><text start="580.8" dur="4.92">sustain yourself off of your creative</text><text start="583.56" dur="5.7">work rather than</text><text start="585.72" dur="5.94">um you know the the uh patterns that we</text><text start="589.26" dur="6.66">often see in um in our community right</text><text start="591.66" dur="6.54">of uh uh of of the um the number of</text><text start="595.92" dur="4.38">creators that we have like a lot of</text><text start="598.2" dur="7.259">folks have to um you know keep a second</text><text start="600.3" dur="7.62">job or they have to uh uh sort of do</text><text start="605.459" dur="3.901">um you know pick up Consulting work pick</text><text start="607.92" dur="3.599">up gigs</text><text start="609.36" dur="4.44">um you know even like uh driving for</text><text start="611.519" dur="4.681">Uber and things like that for for a lot</text><text start="613.8" dur="5.94">of folks that&apos;s um that&apos;s how they&apos;re</text><text start="616.2" dur="5.94">able to uh uh kind of you know smooth</text><text start="619.74" dur="4.14">out the volatility in their income that</text><text start="622.14" dur="3.48">they can generate through through music</text><text start="623.88" dur="4.56">directly</text><text start="625.62" dur="6.719">um and uh uh you know opening up more</text><text start="628.44" dur="5.94">avenues for for those folks to uh uh to</text><text start="632.339" dur="5.461">build that deeper connection ultimately</text><text start="634.38" dur="6.959">uh uh make more revenue from those top</text><text start="637.8" dur="6.3">fans so anyway the way we&apos;re seeing that</text><text

know some of the some of the most</text><text start="758.399" dur="7.141">heavily used features of uh audience</text><text start="761.519" dur="7.681">today being things that users kind of um</text><text start="765.54" dur="6.06">hacked together in a sense right using</text><text start="769.2" dur="4.68">um Primitives that existed but weren&apos;t</text><text start="771.6" dur="4.02">intended for that so a specific example</text><text start="773.88" dur="3.84">I would point out are these remix</text><text start="775.62" dur="4.44">competitions so creators on audience</text><text start="777.72" dur="5.58">will share</text><text start="780.06" dur="6.42">um uh now now today with the fully</text><text start="783.3" dur="5.88">fledged feature set they can share</text><text start="786.48" dur="4.74">um the stems and constituent pieces of a</text><text start="789.18" dur="3.48">track and uh open that up to their</text><text start="791.22" dur="3.059">community and say hey if you want to</text><text start="792.66" dur="3.479">remix this you want to make you know</text><text start="794.279" dur="4.081">cool stuff with it</text><text

an</text><text start="801.54" dur="4.859">official remix EP that I release</text><text start="803.519" dur="6.0">alongside the album that kind of thing</text><text start="806.399" dur="6.721">um super fun the way that I started uh</text><text start="809.519" dur="6.841">uh was a a Creator named Lido on audios</text><text start="813.12" dur="5.64">um just wanted uh you know wanted uh to</text><text start="816.36" dur="4.32">see what his community would do with</text><text start="818.76" dur="6.54">um with one of his songs</text><text start="820.68" dur="7.5">um so he uploaded all the uh uh stems to</text><text start="825.3" dur="5.039">audiences separate uh tracks mark them</text><text start="828.18" dur="5.219">as downloadable many he posts on</text><text start="830.339" dur="6.541">Instagram and said hey if anyone remixes</text><text start="833.399" dur="5.94">this uh Mark your remix with the tag uh</text><text start="836.88" dur="8.579">lito remix I&apos;m gonna go list into all of</text><text start="839.339" dur="9.18">them and abusing the uh tag kind of</text><text start="845.459" dur="6.661">um structure in that fashion uh ended up</text><text start="848.519" dur="6.181">working really well uh uh you know and</text><text start="852.12" dur="4.44">um uh you know I I mean abuse is really</text><text start="854.7" dur="4.5">not even the right word uh it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="856.56" dur="5.579">more just uh you know these things where</text><text start="859.2" dur="5.819">you know we didn&apos;t it&apos;s not like anyone</text><text start="862.139" dur="5.461">uh uh anticipated that that that would</text><text start="865.019" dur="4.56">be a use case that that could make sense</text><text start="867.6" dur="3.6">um there were just Primitives there that</text><text start="869.579" dur="3.301">allowed</text><text start="871.2" dur="4.74">um you know allowed this Creator to come</text><text start="872.88" dur="7.44">up with a new way to engage folks</text><text start="875.94" dur="6.72">um so uh uh we have a whole whole kind</text><text start="880.32" dur="3.6">of laundry list of things like that that</text><text start="882.66" dur="2.88">have popped up</text><text start="883.92" dur="6.479">um and that&apos;s I I think been the best</text><text start="885.54" dur="6.239">way to uh uh to Source new ideas new</text><text start="890.399" dur="3.661">features</text><text start="891.779" dur="5.041">um dark mode is another one is something</text><text start="894.06" dur="4.74">uh no one on our team uh you know three</text><text start="896.82" dur="5.579">four years ago the the team that I work</text><text start="898.8" dur="5.039">uh with um felt strongly about but um</text><text start="902.399" dur="3.601">there&apos;s a condition of our community</text><text start="903.839" dur="4.74">that felt really strongly and someone</text><text start="906.0" dur="6.12">just built it someone made like their</text><text start="908.579" dur="5.161">own kind of uh uh copy of the CSS style</text><text start="912.12" dur="3.48">sheet for the front end</text><text start="913.74" dur="3.599">um that had their own version of dark</text><text start="915.6" dur="3.599">mode they&apos;re like oh this is this is</text><text start="917.339" dur="4.201">really good you know I mean they did a</text><text start="919.199" dur="4.26">really good job with it and uh people</text><text start="921.54" dur="4.859">loved it so</text><text start="923.459" dur="5.94">um yeah like when when people can</text><text start="926.399" dur="6.661">express their preferences not just uh</text><text start="929.399" dur="5.281">through you know asking uh asking like a</text><text start="933.06" dur="4.5">company to do things but can actually</text><text start="934.68" dur="3.42">like go go do it right</text><text start="937.56" dur="3.899">um</text><text start="938.1" dur="4.14">yeah anyway so so you know being able to</text><text start="941.459" dur="3.361">see</text><text start="942.24" dur="5.24">um a lot of those emergent behaviors has</text><text start="944.82" dur="2.66">been super fun</text><text start="948.6" dur="2.94">I&apos;m curious if we could take a step back</text><text start="950.04" dur="3.359">and</text><text start="951.54" dur="3.479">um look at</text><text start="953.399" dur="4.081">so is audience a double-sided Market</text><text start="955.019" dur="4.26">between listeners whose jobs to be done</text><text start="957.48" dur="4.56">is to discover new music and to listen</text><text start="959.279" dur="4.92">to that music and maybe collect it and</text><text start="962.04" dur="4.919">artists whose job to be done is to build</text><text start="964.199" dur="4.621">a audience and to start earning from it</text><text start="966.959" dur="3.961">would that be a correct characterization</text><text start="968.82" dur="3.24">of what of what audios is or is there a</text><text start="970.92" dur="2.779">third side of the market or anything</text><text start="972.06" dur="4.56">you&apos;d push back on there</text><text start="973.699" dur="4.721">uh I think um that&apos;s a correct</text><text start="976.62" dur="4.26">characterization but there is a third</text><text start="978.42" dur="4.62">side of the market too which is uh node</text><text start="980.88" dur="4.62">operators so</text><text start="983.04" dur="5.28">um the way the way uh audience</text><text start="985.5" dur="5.279">architecturally is is set up um there</text><text start="988.32" dur="5.1">are these node operators that have two</text><text start="990.779" dur="6.06">roles in the system they host uh content</text><text start="993.42" dur="5.58">and metadata for creators and then they</text><text start="996.839" dur="5.761">um index the metadata and and there&apos;s</text><text start="999.0" dur="6.12">this kind of uh API that</text><text start="1002.6" dur="4.799">um that the nodes make accessible to be</text><text start="1005.12" dur="4.8">able to query you know if I can look up</text><text start="1007.399" dur="5.94">something like what are what are all of</text><text start="1009.92" dur="5.339">Kevin&apos;s uh uh tracks that he&apos;s uploaded</text><text start="1013.339" dur="4.021">and you know how much of people engaged</text><text start="1015.259" dur="4.38">with them right so</text><text start="1017.36" dur="4.38">um so yeah that with that third third</text><text start="1019.639" dur="3.241">prong um I think that&apos;s an accurate</text><text start="1021.74" dur="2.88">picture</text><text start="1022.88" dur="3.6">got it</text><text start="1024.62" dur="3.78">um you know I&apos;m curious between in that</text><text start="1026.48" dur="4.02">triple-sided Marketplace what are the</text><text start="1028.4" dur="5.22">things that you can do as a web 3</text><text start="1030.5" dur="5.699">project that&apos;s uh that&apos;s that&apos;s working</text><text start="1033.62" dur="4.679">in this space that you couldn&apos;t do if if</text><text start="1036.199" dur="4.26">you were a web 2 projects you know does</text><text start="1038.299" dur="5.04">does web3 give any super powers to</text><text start="1040.459" dur="5.521">audience that that it would that it</text><text start="1043.339" dur="6.181">would know otherwise already have</text><text start="1045.98" dur="4.86">yeah yeah it uh uh most certainly does</text><text start="1049.52" dur="5.22">and</text><text start="1050.84" dur="5.52">um uh yeah I think a few that that uh uh</text><text start="1054.74" dur="5.22">the folks listening today would probably</text><text start="1056.36" dur="7.14">really enjoy hearing about our um uh</text><text start="1059.96" dur="6.42">Discovery so the uh algorithm for</text><text start="1063.5" dur="5.4">determining like what you know Trends on</text><text start="1066.38" dur="6.06">audios uh is something that&apos;s actually</text><text start="1068.9" dur="6.48">like open collaboratively developed um</text><text start="1072.44" dur="6.9">but also something that um can be forked</text><text start="1075.38" dur="7.14">so there can be like multiple uh uh</text><text start="1079.34" dur="6.78">views of how trending should work for</text><text start="1082.52" dur="6.42">example and uh uh you know if you</text><text start="1086.12" dur="5.64">um because all that metadata is open too</text><text start="1088.94" dur="6.06">right uh all of everything from you know</text><text start="1091.76" dur="5.52">plays to favorites to</text><text start="1095.0" dur="6.299">um uh you know the the whole Corpus of</text><text start="1097.28" dur="6.18">of uh track metadata is all open</text><text start="1101.299" dur="4.62">um folks can also build their own uh</text><text start="1103.46" dur="4.14">recommender systems Analytics tool</text><text start="1105.919" dur="4.921">cooling</text><text start="1107.6" dur="7.26">Etc so I think that&apos;s been one of the</text><text start="1110.84" dur="7.74">biggest superpowers like the um uh uh</text><text start="1114.86" dur="5.52">for for the size of catalog that uh</text><text start="1118.58" dur="4.08">audience has today</text><text start="1120.38" dur="3.84">um you know on the order of a million or</text><text start="1122.66" dur="5.58">so tracks</text><text start="1124.22" dur="5.76">um like if if you sat uh uh like all day</text><text start="1128.24" dur="3.84">for the rest of your life and and</text><text start="1129.98" dur="3.059">listened only to music on audience you</text><text start="1132.08" dur="5.099">wouldn&apos;t be able to hear everything</text><text start="1133.039" dur="7.201">right there need to be uh shortcuts to</text><text start="1137.179" dur="6.24">um helping to surface to you the content</text><text start="1140.24" dur="5.58">that uh you&apos;re most likely to enjoy at a</text><text start="1143.419" dur="5.341">given time and um you know the the</text><text start="1145.82" dur="5.46">algorithmic curation side is is</text><text start="1148.76" dur="5.34">um it&apos;s a big part of that equally big</text><text start="1151.28" dur="6.42">though in in our case is uh human driven</text><text start="1154.1" dur="6.24">curation and uh the capability for</text><text start="1157.7" dur="5.7">um uh individual curators on audios who</text><text start="1160.34" dur="5.52">are making playlists reposting content</text><text start="1163.4" dur="4.86">Etc to be able to earn Revenue through</text><text start="1165.86" dur="4.199">to uh the listening that they create</text><text start="1168.26" dur="3.96">through their curation right so there</text><text start="1170.059" dur="4.201">are a number of uh people like I follow</text><text start="1172.22" dur="4.92">for example</text><text start="1174.26" dur="5.039">um that uh I follow because I think you</text><text start="1177.14" dur="4.8">know I I like their taste in music and</text><text start="1179.299" dur="6.541">then I will you know listen to to the</text><text start="1181.94" dur="6.18">things that they&apos;re engaging with and um</text><text start="1185.84" dur="5.339">through that like that there&apos;s there&apos;s</text><text start="1188.12" dur="5.1">actually a sustainable kind of uh you</text><text start="1191.179" dur="5.401">know business model if you will for that</text><text start="1193.22" dur="7.38">uh uh you know curator of content to to</text><text start="1196.58" dur="5.7">actually you know be able to uh uh uh to</text><text start="1200.6" dur="3.959">generate Revenue now I I don&apos;t think</text><text start="1202.28" dur="4.2">anyone uh quite yet on audience is</text><text start="1204.559" dur="4.62">actually earning a living full on</text><text start="1206.48" dur="5.28">through uh through curation but that&apos;s</text><text start="1209.179" dur="4.801">the direction that um you know I think</text><text start="1211.76" dur="6.12">that I think that heads right now that</text><text start="1213.98" dur="6.96">there is a uh a a baked in business</text><text start="1217.88" dur="5.1">model there that&apos;s above board and that</text><text start="1220.94" dur="2.94">um that that folks understand and make</text><text start="1222.98" dur="2.64">sense</text><text start="1223.88" dur="4.74">um you know their incentive from</text><text start="1225.62" dur="5.34">accurate curation perspective is to uh</text><text start="1228.62" dur="4.2">generate as much listening on the things</text><text start="1230.96" dur="3.839">they curate as possible right because</text><text start="1232.82" dur="3.599">that&apos;s that&apos;s how they they generate</text><text start="1234.799" dur="3.661">Revenue so</text><text start="1236.419" dur="4.801">um so those are a couple couple examples</text><text start="1238.46" dur="4.56">that that uh really stand out</text><text start="1241.22" dur="4.86">um I think the biggest superpower from</text><text start="1243.02" dur="6.36">the artist&apos;s perspective though is uh uh</text><text start="1246.08" dur="6.12">the um you know not not being able to be</text><text start="1249.38" dur="5.039">uh de-platformed right so</text><text start="1252.2" dur="5.58">um that&apos;s kind of the uh</text><text start="1254.419" dur="6.721">um the issue that for the last 20 years</text><text start="1257.78" dur="5.399">or so has plagued a lot of other uh uh</text><text start="1261.14" dur="4.08">user generated music</text><text start="1263.179" dur="4.201">um ecosystems and communities I mean</text><text start="1265.22" dur="4.56">going I&apos;m going to date myself saying</text><text start="1267.38" dur="3.96">this but all the way back to Myspace uh</text><text start="1269.78" dur="3.6">uh all the way up through you know</text><text start="1271.34" dur="3.9">SoundCloud being one of one of the more</text><text start="1273.38" dur="6.179">recent examples there</text><text start="1275.24" dur="6.72">um there&apos;s a a kind of a long history of</text><text start="1279.559" dur="4.74">uh platforms changing the rules on on</text><text start="1281.96" dur="5.219">creators and on developers</text><text start="1284.299" dur="4.62">um when it when it suits them uh and</text><text start="1287.179" dur="3.781">ultimately that in the case of</text><text start="1288.919" dur="5.281">SoundCloud most recently leading to this</text><text start="1290.96" dur="5.28">uh Mass Exodus of of their Community uh</text><text start="1294.2" dur="5.76">you know I think today uh soundcloud&apos;s</text><text start="1296.24" dur="8.16">ongoing engagement usage is is about A</text><text start="1299.96" dur="8.04">fifth or a fourth of what it was was so</text><text start="1304.4" dur="5.58">um so being structured in in uh the way</text><text start="1308.0" dur="5.28">that audience is and where users</text><text start="1309.98" dur="6.0">actually control things like duration</text><text start="1313.28" dur="6.24">and Discovery</text><text start="1315.98" dur="6.36">um I I couldn&apos;t like even if I wanted to</text><text start="1319.52" dur="6.18">uh uh change Discovery somehow to favor</text><text start="1322.34" dur="5.88">like you know uh uh institutionally</text><text start="1325.7" dur="4.74">owned content so like from record labels</text><text start="1328.22" dur="6.839">and and what have you like I I couldn&apos;t</text><text start="1330.44" dur="7.02">do that uh uh unless a majority of the</text><text start="1335.059" dur="5.221">community actually voted to adopt the</text><text

are</text><text start="1359.6" dur="4.86">the things that um our community have</text><text start="1361.76" dur="4.26">have gotten gotten most excited about</text><text start="1364.46" dur="4.98">um just that like</text><text start="1366.02" dur="6.06">uh I I guess operating with a level of</text><text start="1369.44" dur="4.68">certainty that Their audience here can&apos;t</text><text

dur="6.36">interesting more useful more valuable</text><text start="1388.52" dur="7.2">um that&apos;s I think those things have uh</text><text start="1391.64" dur="6.659">have made folks uh uh you know choose to</text><text start="1395.72" dur="4.56">to engage here you know even before</text><text start="1398.299" dur="3.661">there was an audience for them or</text><text start="1400.28" dur="4.44">anything else right those first few</text><text start="1401.96" dur="5.64">hundred or first few thousand uh artists</text><text start="1404.72" dur="5.04">who are you know posting into the void</text><text start="1407.6" dur="6.54">um they were so excited for these things</text><text start="1409.76" dur="6.48">and uh uh now operating it at uh a</text><text start="1414.14" dur="3.779">larger level of scale it&apos;s really really</text><text start="1416.24" dur="3.48">fun and cool to see these things</text><text start="1417.919" dur="4.861">actually playing out in practice right</text><text start="1419.72" dur="6.079">the uh the things we theorized about in</text><text start="1422.78" dur="3.019">um in the early days</text><text start="1426.08" dur="4.92">yeah you know I&apos;m curious</text><text start="1428.659" dur="3.841">and you know before this I asked this</text><text start="1431.0" dur="3.419">question I just want to say this preface</text><text start="1432.5" dur="5.64">where which is that you know I guess I&apos;m</text><text start="1434.419" dur="5.521">I&apos;m mostly well known for uh funding or</text><text start="1438.14" dur="3.3">a building git coin which is a</text><text start="1439.94" dur="3.719">crowdfunding platform that allows people</text><text start="1441.44" dur="5.099">who are working on public goods uh to</text><text start="1443.659" dur="4.26">get funding and you know we&apos;ve Bitcoin</text><text start="1446.539" dur="3.241">reached a similar amount of scale with</text><text start="1447.919" dur="3.601">72 million dollars worth of funding for</text><text start="1449.78" dur="3.66">open source software but also other</text><text start="1451.52" dur="5.22">other things and and I guess I&apos;ll just</text><text start="1453.44" dur="4.68">say that I I view like creative work and</text><text start="1456.74" dur="4.319">knowledge work to be on this kind of</text><text start="1458.12" dur="7.14">spectrum of you know and I would put</text><text start="1461.059" dur="5.881">music and uh artists that are building</text><text start="1465.26" dur="4.2">up an audience sort of on the same</text><text start="1466.94" dur="4.2">Spectrum as a programmer uh which is you</text><text start="1469.46" dur="3.24">know I self-identify as a programmer I</text><text start="1471.14" dur="2.94">think Ron you said you&apos;re also a</text><text start="1472.7" dur="4.74">programmer is that right before we</text><text start="1474.08" dur="5.04">started I am yeah yeah oh and so and so</text><text start="1477.44" dur="4.02">you know I feel this like the Symmetry</text><text start="1479.12" dur="5.16">between get coin grants having this data</text><text start="1481.46" dur="5.459">set of like 700 000 data points of what</text><text start="1484.28" dur="5.82">the ethereum community cares about and</text><text start="1486.919" dur="6.12">audience having tens of

start="1495.08" dur="3.78">just wondering you know what&apos;s your what</text><text start="1496.88" dur="4.08">what is your view on the emergent</text><text start="1498.86" dur="5.4">collective intelligence that&apos;s coming up</text><text start="1500.96" dur="7.079">in in the audience system around music</text><text start="1504.26" dur="6.48">curation and Discovery and just

dur="4.261">music and Discovery it feels like with</text><text start="1514.34" dur="3.66">that open data set all being on chain</text><text start="1516.44" dur="3.54">there&apos;s really an interesting data</text><text start="1518.0" dur="3.36">science problem here and and I think</text><text start="1519.98" dur="3.36">that collective intelligence if we&apos;re</text><text start="1521.36" dur="3.78">going to do Commons resource allocation</text><text start="1523.34" dur="3.62">in the right way then we need collective</text><text start="1525.14" dur="4.74">intelligence to figure out which parts</text><text start="1526.96" dur="5.38">of of this data are the most important</text><text start="1529.88" dur="4.679">to the to the most people and you know I</text><text start="1532.34" dur="4.14">I think that I&apos;m I&apos;m complexifying it by</text><text start="1534.559" dur="3.301">saying all this stuff but I&apos;ll just</text><text start="1536.48" dur="2.28">stick the landing on this question by</text><text start="1537.86" dur="2.819">saying</text><text start="1538.76" dur="3.18">what are the coolest things that you&apos;re</text><text

start="1554.36" dur="5.04">motivation uh other folks in in the</text><text start="1556.88" dur="4.44">community have uh differing motivations</text><text start="1559.4" dur="5.1">too but</text><text start="1561.32" dur="6.239">um I kind of uh uh I kind of miss the</text><text start="1564.5" dur="5.64">days when you know you would uh uh</text><text start="1567.559" dur="4.74">stumble upon something that unlike</text><text start="1570.14" dur="5.419">anything you&apos;ve ever heard but that you</text><text start="1572.299" dur="5.941">end up liking you know and uh uh I think</text><text start="1575.559" dur="5.381">algorithmic curation more broadly is</text><text start="1578.24" dur="5.4">really good at serving you more of the</text><text start="1580.94" dur="5.7">same of something right so it&apos;s good at</text><text start="1583.64" dur="6.3">figuring out what&apos;s similar and uh uh</text><text start="1586.64" dur="6.84">surfacing to you uh uh those things I</text><text start="1589.94" dur="6.119">think we haven&apos;t uh you know yeah you</text><text start="1593.48" dur="5.4">know as a try try as folks might uh we</text><text start="1596.059" dur="6.181">haven&apos;t figured out algorithmically yet</text><text start="1598.88" dur="6.36">um you know just societally how to</text><text start="1602.24" dur="6.0">um how to have taste right and how to uh</text><text start="1605.24" dur="5.4">uh kind of source for for Taste</text><text start="1608.24" dur="4.02">um and I think that&apos;s where uh uh the</text><text start="1610.64" dur="4.62">collective intelligence side of of</text><text start="1612.26" dur="7.76">audience is is most exciting to me um</text><text start="1615.26" dur="8.76">the uh uh opportunity to uh uh to reward</text><text start="1620.02" dur="7.72">good curation and good selection of of</text><text start="1624.02" dur="6.42">um of uh uh music being done by people</text><text start="1627.74" dur="4.5">um and I&apos;m excited to uh to see the</text><text start="1630.44" dur="4.5">community double down on that like I&apos;d</text><text start="1632.24" dur="4.62">love to see people uh build out things</text><text start="1634.94" dur="6.18">like</text><text start="1636.86" dur="6.059">um uh uh for example incentivizing uh</text><text start="1641.12" dur="4.32">someone to be among the earlier</text><text start="1642.919" dur="4.561">listeners of a piece of content that</text><text start="1645.44" dur="4.92">ends up going viral right like what if</text><text start="1647.48" dur="5.88">you could actually get rewarded for</text><text start="1650.36" dur="5.04">um uh uh doing I mean it is work right</text><text start="1653.36" dur="4.74">it&apos;s work if you were going out and</text><text start="1655.4" dur="4.5">listening to uh uh to a lot of content</text><text start="1658.1" dur="2.64">to try to find those Diamonds in the</text><text start="1659.9" dur="2.879">Rough</text><text start="1660.74" dur="4.2">um you know I like to do that for fun</text><text start="1662.779" dur="4.26">too but I&apos;m I&apos;m providing a value to</text><text

more</text><text start="1684.2" dur="5.94">valuable as more people</text><text start="1686.84" dur="6.48">um use it and engage with it and uh are</text><text start="1690.14" dur="5.88">effectively

on</text><text start="1697.94" dur="5.76">in the world and uh</text><text start="1700.7" dur="4.68">um yeah I I think that</text><text start="1703.7" dur="4.68">um that Collective</text><text

dur="3.539">but ultimately I think that&apos;s where</text><text start="1732.799" dur="4.38">that&apos;s where these things get most</text><text start="1734.299" dur="5.641">exciting for me when you can actually</text><text start="1737.179" dur="6.541">um directly incentivize uh value</text><text start="1739.94" dur="7.56">creating activities at a level that is</text><text start="1743.72" dur="6.24">less than uh uh you know the amount of</text><text start="1747.5" dur="5.94">net value being created for the</text><text start="1749.96" dur="6.839">ecosystem but more than you know much</text><text start="1753.44" dur="6.06">more than usually uh the zero that there</text><text start="1756.799" dur="4.201">that uh you know a a contributor could</text><text start="1759.5"

start="1765.26" dur="2.94">scenario where that collective</text><text start="1766.64" dur="3.18">intelligence can get stronger and</text><text start="1768.2" dur="4.079">stronger and

discover new artists or just play</text><text start="1917.779" dur="3.721">your favorite hits</text><text start="1919.34" dur="3.26">um then then basically there&apos;s just like</text><text start="1921.5" dur="5.159">this</text><text start="1922.6" dur="5.98">explosion of curation potential that</text><text start="1926.659" dur="4.561">comes out of the free and open source</text><text

start="1949.94" dur="4.739">party that that is doing it so I just</text><text start="1952.279" dur="4.5">see a lot of potential there and I also</text><text start="1954.679" dur="3.6">see a lot of

dur="5.52">um I actually think for for what it&apos;s</text><text start="2271.839" dur="6.481">worth this is the direction uh uh music</text><text start="2275.32" dur="4.92">is going with with or without us um but</text><text start="2278.32" dur="4.56">I I do see audience being a large part</text><text start="2280.24" dur="4.859">of this this future but I think the the</text><text

engagement economy um as we call</text><text start="2292.3" dur="7.86">it where uh uh creators are vertically</text><text start="2296.92" dur="7.679">integrated businesses that are able to</text><text start="2300.16" dur="6.84">uh uh you know directly offer services</text><text start="2304.599" dur="4.52">um and and uh other things to their fans</text><text start="2307.0" dur="4.74">and by Services I mean everything from</text><text start="2309.119" dur="5.321">uh you know concert tickets when they</text><text start="2311.74" dur="4.44">tour to merchandise to you know content</text><text start="2314.44" dur="5.399">like music</text><text start="2316.18" dur="5.22">um all of the the kind of uh uh things</text><text start="2319.839" dur="3.481">that</text><text start="2321.4" dur="5.28">um as a Creator right now you are</text><text start="2323.32" dur="5.46">dependent on these centralized silos of</text><text start="2326.68" dur="5.58">information that don&apos;t talk to each</text><text start="2328.78" dur="6.299">other and that have no ability to uh</text><text start="2332.26" dur="5.22">cross pollinate between one another</text><text start="2335.079" dur="5.04">um I think that that relationship gets</text><text start="2337.48" dur="6.66">reoriented a bit where um you know the</text><text start="2340.119" dur="5.881">the uh creators are able to to you know</text><text start="2344.14" dur="4.56">vertically integrate that control of the</text><text start="2346.0" dur="4.2">relationship with fans but deploy you</text><text start="2348.7" dur="3.419">know almost like you could think of this</text><text start="2350.2" dur="5.399">as like different different experiences</text><text start="2352.119" dur="6.0">different modules on top of that same uh</text><text start="2355.599" dur="4.98">core social graph right uh uh everything</text><text start="2358.119" dur="5.161">from yeah tours and concerts to</text><text start="2360.579" dur="5.941">everything else so uh uh you know for</text><text start="2363.28" dur="6.6">our part in that um we really see audius</text><text start="2366.52" dur="6.9">long-term uh uh becoming like the the</text><text start="2369.88" dur="5.699">fan CRM of record if you will right uh</text><text start="2373.42" dur="4.62">uh we</text><text start="2375.579" dur="6.601">um we think audios is is the best place</text><text start="2378.04" dur="6.72">to uh uh build up and manage that that</text><text start="2382.18" dur="5.58">social graph and then ultimately uh uh</text><text start="2384.76" dur="5.94">for others over time to uh so you know I</text><text start="2387.76" dur="6.48">think today there are uh something like</text><text start="2390.7" dur="5.22">a a hundred or around 100 uh third-party</text><text start="2394.24" dur="3.96">applications built around audience</text><text start="2395.92" dur="4.02">actually the majority of listening on</text><text start="2398.2" dur="3.54">audience today doesn&apos;t even come from</text><text start="2399.94" dur="4.08">the uh first party product it&apos;s coming</text><text start="2401.74" dur="5.099">from these uh various different front</text><text start="2404.02" dur="4.98">ends and and things that um uh other</text><text start="2406.839" dur="4.201">folks have built out um I would see</text><text start="2409.0" dur="4.74">similar Integrations happening over time</text><text start="2411.04" dur="4.26">uh in those other verticals right um</text><text start="2413.74" dur="4.98">because it makes sense for those folks</text><text start="2415.3" dur="6.0">too right if you can uh if you can tap</text><text start="2418.72" dur="4.98">the uh distribution to fans that exists</text><text start="2421.3" dur="5.64">here and use it in your you know</text><text start="2423.7" dur="5.7">merchandise storefront or your</text><text start="2426.94" dur="3.72">um uh uh you know concert ticketing</text><text start="2429.4" dur="5.04">platform</text><text start="2430.66" dur="5.76">um all of that feeding back into uh the</text><text start="2434.44" dur="3.78">same social graph and the same data set</text><text start="2436.42" dur="3.72">makes those relationships more and more</text><text start="2438.22" dur="5.94">valuable over time eventually you&apos;ll be</text><text start="2440.14" dur="6.78">able to uh you know I can I as a uh you</text><text start="2444.16" dur="5.22">know let&apos;s say I&apos;m I&apos;m uh a fan and can</text><text start="2446.92" dur="4.56">and you know you&apos;re you&apos;re a creator of</text><text start="2449.38" dur="4.979">this podcast you should be able to look</text><text start="2451.48" dur="6.359">at my profile and see oh I&apos;ve

East Denver or</text><text start="2461.44" dur="5.34">something like that I uh you know have</text><text start="2464.079" dur="4.5">uh uh purchased some form of merchandise</text><text start="2466.78" dur="3.42">from you it should be possible for you</text><text start="2468.579" dur="4.141">to see all of that but then ultimately</text><text start="2470.2" dur="3.899">to segment me based on that</text><text start="2472.72" dur="3.119">um that&apos;s that&apos;s really where we see</text><text start="2474.099" dur="3.181">this all going</text><text start="2475.839" dur="3.601">yeah</text><text start="2477.28" dur="4.74">yeah it&apos;s really interesting to follow</text><text start="2479.44" dur="3.899">and you know I I just want to like you</text><text start="2482.02" dur="2.94">know I know that we&apos;re both engineers</text><text start="2483.339" dur="3.901">and system thinkers here but I just want</text><text start="2484.96" dur="5.1">to land

if you&apos;re a creative person</text><text start="2498.16" dur="4.32">trying to get out there and so I think</text><text start="2499.72" dur="5.7">that that that is all in the service of</text><text

and um</text><text start="2521.74" dur="6.839">yeah I I think this is just uh I I do</text><text start="2525.88" dur="6.36">really see this this being the way that</text><text start="2528.579" dur="6.901">all uh uh creative work heads over time</text><text start="2532.24" dur="6.839">um you know the the idea that that you</text><text start="2535.48" dur="7.26">as a Creator should be uh uh
