dur="3.72">about Spruce so uh tell us what Spruce</text><text start="209.819" dur="2.28">is and how you got to be working on this</text><text start="211.2" dur="3.42">problem</text><text start="212.099" dur="5.161">Spruce is working on decentralized</text><text start="214.62" dur="3.839">identity and data and one of our core</text><text start="217.26" dur="3.18">Tendencies we want to make sure that</text><text start="218.459" dur="4.081">users control their identity and data</text><text start="220.44" dur="3.54">across the web you see a lot of what&apos;s</text><text start="222.54" dur="2.88">going on in the crypto space especially</text><text start="223.98" dur="2.88">around assets how can that also</text><text start="225.42" dur="3.899">translate over to user zoning and</text><text start="226.86" dur="4.98">controlling their identity as well</text><text start="229.319" dur="4.261">probably the core way of summarizing</text><text start="231.84" dur="3.899">what we&apos;re working on it Spruce a lot a</text><text start="233.58" dur="4.079">lot of it being developer focused purely</text><text start="235.739" dur="3.961">on bringing open source software to the</text><text start="237.659" dur="4.5">world and letting users Implement these</text><text start="239.7" dur="4.74">kinds of workflows into their adapts and</text><text start="242.159" dur="4.8">regular applications too and try to make</text><text start="244.44" dur="4.379">it as easy as possible for them</text><text start="246.959" dur="3.601">um yeah let&apos;s maybe spend five minutes</text><text start="248.819" dur="3.721">on your your history and how you got to</text><text start="250.56" dur="5.399">be working on this problem</text><text start="252.54" dur="5.759">yeah so before Spruce times</text><text start="255.959" dur="4.981">um I was at a different tree known as</text><text start="258.299" dur="4.741">Alpine uh over on the consensus side of</text><text start="260.94" dur="4.38">things so my co-founder Wayne and I</text><text start="263.04" dur="4.32">worked over at consensus uh years back</text><text start="265.32" dur="3.84">and it&apos;s tough to interject that you and</text><text start="267.36" dur="3.18">I work together at consensus I think you</text><text start="269.16" dur="3.539">were out in Boulder for a summer and we</text><text start="270.54" dur="4.14">we hung out for not a summer but like at</text><text start="272.699" dur="3.06">least a month uh while we were both at</text><text start="274.68" dur="2.519">consensus</text><text start="275.759" dur="2.94">I do remember that I do miss the</text><text start="277.199" dur="4.56">mountain views too the views out there</text><text start="278.699" dur="4.681">are beautiful and uh we were working on</text><text start="281.759" dur="3.061">a decentralized identity at the time</text><text start="283.38" dur="2.879">over at consensus and consensus was</text><text start="284.82" dur="3.24">probably one of the leading</text><text start="286.259" dur="3.481">organizations putting resourcing into</text><text start="288.06" dur="4.02">decentralized identity that many years</text><text start="289.74" dur="3.84">back like really early to the trend with</text><text start="292.08" dur="2.94">like the folks over at uport and the</text><text start="293.58" dur="3.059">work they were doing way early on in</text><text start="295.02" dur="3.899">terms of bringing decentralized identity</text><text start="296.639" dur="4.56">uh over to the ethereum ecosystem and</text><text start="298.919" dur="5.521">Beyond and like understanding that the</text><text start="301.199" dur="5.641">keys we use in crypto land uh translate</text><text start="304.44" dur="4.86">well to like you know these</text><text start="306.84" dur="4.02">decentralized identity paradigms and</text><text start="309.3" dur="3.6">some of the focus we had at consensus</text><text start="310.86" dur="3.839">Wayne and I were on platform economies</text><text start="312.9" dur="3.18">namely that a lot of companies in the</text><text start="314.699" dur="4.141">space were trying to rebuild a lot of</text><text start="316.08" dur="5.04">different forms of platform economies uh</text><text start="318.84" dur="3.78">at the time but in a decentralized</text><text start="321.12" dur="3.359">manner like tilting some of the things</text><text start="322.62" dur="4.26">towards users more so than platforms</text><text start="324.479" dur="4.56">reaping a lot of fees and one of the</text><text start="326.88" dur="4.02">things that was missing at the time uh</text><text start="329.039" dur="3.901">was the trust portion of the transaction</text><text start="330.9" dur="3.54">how do you handle knowing who you&apos;re</text><text start="332.94" dur="3.599">dealing with on these platforms if it&apos;s</text><text start="334.44" dur="3.42">all decentralized and namely a lot of</text><text start="336.539" dur="3.72">these things we could operate as like a</text><text start="337.86" dur="4.559">public key like 0x you know yada yada</text><text start="340.259" dur="4.021">but let&apos;s say you kind of have the</text><text start="342.419" dur="4.021">example of like a decentralized Airbnb</text><text start="344.28" dur="3.72">uh where folks want to stay at a place</text><text start="346.44" dur="3.9">over time we&apos;re trying to reduce the</text><text start="348.0" dur="4.74">amount of fees that platforms take and</text><text start="350.34" dur="5.16">really keep it between the owner and the</text><text start="352.74" dur="5.459">person uh renting the space you&apos;re going</text><text start="355.5" dur="4.919">to need a couple of things namely the</text><text start="358.199" dur="3.78">legal portion of the identity which is</text><text start="360.419" dur="3.06">does that person actually own the space</text><text start="361.979" dur="4.56">and have the rights to write that space</text><text start="363.479" dur="4.981">out the reputational identity as this</text><text start="366.539" dur="4.861">person have a good reputation over time</text><text start="368.46" dur="4.62">of like being a good renter or being a</text><text start="371.4" dur="3.66">good person leasing the space out to</text><text start="373.08" dur="4.26">someone and everything is kind of in</text><text start="375.06" dur="3.359">order as it should be and lastly you</text><text start="377.34" dur="3.0">know you&apos;re not you have like certain</text><text start="378.419" dur="2.941">safety checks with reputational identity</text><text start="380.34" dur="2.359">like you&apos;re not going to get serial</text><text start="381.36" dur="4.98">murdered overnight</text><text start="382.699" dur="5.321">so beyond kind of just us sending assets</text><text start="386.34" dur="3.359">to a Smart contract kind of locking it</text><text start="388.02" dur="3.78">up and having this decentralized Airbnb</text><text start="389.699" dur="4.321">how do you slowly reintroduce just the</text><text start="391.8" dur="3.899">right amount of information for the</text><text start="394.02" dur="4.619">counterparties to make sure that the</text><text start="395.699" dur="4.261">transaction is safe in different ways</text><text start="398.639" dur="3.961">that was a big part of how we got</text><text start="399.96" dur="4.44">started over at Spruce and around 2020</text><text start="402.6" dur="4.74">we were independent organization</text><text start="404.4" dur="4.44">specifically working on libraries to</text><text start="407.34" dur="4.079">bring these decentralized identity</text><text start="408.84" dur="5.4">paradigms into play and implementing</text><text start="411.419" dur="4.441">them on applications and most recently a</text><text start="414.24" dur="5.34">lot of our work for the last year</text><text start="415.86" dur="5.94">focused on sign in with ethereum and</text><text start="419.58" dur="3.72">what a lot of that has to do is uh the</text><text start="421.8" dur="3.239">first part of kind of identity</text><text start="423.3" dur="3.48">especially when dealing with apps and</text><text start="425.039" dur="3.72">services on the Internet is around</text><text start="426.78" dur="3.66">signing in that first interaction that</text><text start="428.759" dur="3.66">you take when you interact and interface</text><text start="430.44" dur="4.14">with something is that sign-in portion</text><text start="432.419" dur="4.381">and that&apos;s been a lot of the focus of</text><text start="434.58" dur="5.519">our work ever since it&apos;s been a pretty</text><text start="436.8" dur="5.16">wild ride but I I love kind of how the</text><text start="440.099" dur="4.021">space is slowly evolving into these two</text><text start="441.96" dur="3.78">areas and folks realizing that at the</text><text start="444.12" dur="2.76">center of all these things are keys that</text><text start="445.74" dur="2.82">all the stuff you do on the financial</text><text start="446.88" dur="3.48">side deals with keys and all these stuff</text><text start="448.56" dur="4.38">that you do on the identity side is also</text><text start="450.36" dur="3.3">using that same key pair</text><text start="452.94" dur="3.06">um</text><text start="453.66" dur="4.02">yeah I mean I&apos;ll just uh you know while</text><text start="456.0" dur="3.3">we&apos;re sort of traversing this design</text><text start="457.68" dur="4.56">space I guess I&apos;ll just say out loud</text><text start="459.3" dur="5.339">what my thesis of so you know green pill</text><text start="462.24" dur="4.92">is all about regenerative web 3 and</text><text start="464.639" dur="4.68">things that are pro-social with web3 and</text><text start="467.16" dur="3.86">uh the reason why we&apos;ve been spending</text><text start="469.319" dur="5.341">some time this season talking about</text><text start="471.02" dur="5.26">identity is that if you can track</text><text start="474.66" dur="3.06">identities and and I don&apos;t just mean</text><text start="476.28" dur="3.84">like you know I&apos;m Kevin and you&apos;re</text><text start="477.72" dur="4.199">Gregory Rocco identities but also like</text><text start="480.12" dur="3.9">persistent pseudonymous identities</text><text start="481.919" dur="3.361">online then what you can do is you can</text><text start="484.02" dur="2.76">start to have repeat interactions</text><text start="485.28" dur="3.66">between these actors and you can start</text><text start="486.78" dur="3.9">to track okay this is the social uh</text><text start="488.94" dur="3.539">attributes of this counterparty that I&apos;m</text><text start="490.68" dur="3.66">working with and you can start to have</text><text start="492.479" dur="3.06">through repeat interactions you can also</text><text start="494.34" dur="3.24">start to have positive some games</text><text start="495.539" dur="4.321">between the actors in the ecosystem</text><text start="497.58" dur="5.16">which wasn&apos;t possible in D5 without</text><text start="499.86" dur="4.679">collateral you know um and so if you can</text><text start="502.74" dur="3.299">complexify the identity space then you</text><text start="504.539" dur="3.0">can start to take the positive some</text><text start="506.039" dur="3.06">actors and put them in a certain bucket</text><text start="507.539" dur="3.961">give them access to features and</text><text start="509.099" dur="5.94">protocols and that&apos;s where you know kind</text><text start="511.5" dur="5.219">of like the regen uh one plus one equals</text><text start="515.039" dur="3.781">three in in that kind of world with</text><text start="516.719" dur="3.481">identity and so you know I know that</text><text start="518.82" dur="4.2">we&apos;re talking a lot about the technology</text><text start="520.2" dur="4.68">private Keys signing with ethereum here</text><text start="523.02" dur="3.6">and and I just wanted to make sure for</text><text start="524.88" dur="4.8">The Listener that we connect the sort of</text><text start="526.62" dur="5.159">like regen thesis uh to to the identity</text><text start="529.68" dur="3.719">piece there and so I don&apos;t know if you</text><text start="531.779" dur="4.261">have any any comments on that if not I</text><text start="533.399" dur="3.961">have more more questions about your work</text><text start="536.04" dur="3.72">no and I think that&apos;s important too</text><text start="537.36" dur="4.38">because like for a user</text><text start="539.76" dur="3.9">how does someone show up to an app or</text><text start="541.74" dur="4.38">service uh what they have with what they</text><text start="543.66" dur="4.44">have already and show that service</text><text start="546.12" dur="3.839">exactly what it needs to know</text><text start="548.1" dur="3.78">for that interaction without over</text><text start="549.959" dur="3.361">sharing without doing too much and</text><text start="551.88" dur="3.3">really like you have these kind of</text><text start="553.32" dur="2.88">privacy preserving items in there as</text><text start="555.18" dur="3.06">well like how do you bring everything</text><text start="556.2" dur="3.42">together and the user can go across</text><text start="558.24" dur="3.24">these different interactions and make</text><text start="559.62" dur="3.54">sure that they have the ability to show</text><text start="561.48" dur="3.359">themselves and what is needed just for</text><text start="563.16" dur="4.799">that interaction without that over</text><text start="564.839" dur="4.921">sharing for each for

dur="4.92">I think that that&apos;s really a key point</text><text start="574.8" dur="5.7">you know as we as we start to build this</text><text start="577.86" dur="4.14">more regenerative positive sum

get into checking out this</text><text start="591.36" dur="4.46">design space and and to me that just</text><text start="593.459" dur="4.801">makes it all that the more exciting</text><text start="595.82" dur="4.78">yeah and I think a lot of it deals</text><text start="598.26" dur="4.019">specifically with like</text><text start="600.6" dur="3.359">with like identity and data how do you</text><text start="602.279" dur="4.74">reverse the login</text><text start="603.959" dur="5.521">um where instead of a user logging into</text><text start="607.019" dur="4.141">a platformer site

on their behalf</text><text start="618.12" dur="4.38">having like kind of a fragmented version</text><text start="620.519" dur="3.301">of you across different apps how do you</text><text start="622.5" dur="2.88">just come to an app and present it</text><text start="623.82" dur="3.36">yourself and be like here I am this is</text><text start="625.38" dur="3.899">everything associated with me that I&apos;m</text><text start="627.18" dur="3.18">consenting to give you and that&apos;s kind</text><text start="629.279" dur="2.341">of the end of it and these apps don&apos;t</text><text start="630.36" dur="3.599">even have to hold user data anymore</text><text start="631.62" dur="5.159">users can just bring it with them for</text><text start="633.959" dur="5.281">that session and now apps can instead of</text><text start="636.779" dur="4.261">competing on how much data they can</text><text start="639.24" dur="3.779">store about users apps can now compete</text><text start="641.04"

dur="2.88">yeah I mean I think in a world and you</text><text start="648.36" dur="3.12">know we just need to say it out loud</text><text start="649.32" dur="3.54">this might be obvious to to me and you</text><text start="651.48" dur="2.88">but you know with all the data leaks</text><text start="652.86" dur="3.12">that have been happening where people</text><text start="654.36" dur="4.02">try to hoard all this data about their</text><text start="655.98" dur="5.52">users and then you know they get hacked</text><text start="658.38" dur="6.36">and they accidentally like you know uh</text><text start="661.5" dur="5.94">I think it&apos;s Equifax as it&apos;s one of the</text><text start="664.74" dur="4.68">big three has leaked my identity data um</text><text start="667.44" dur="4.38">and their whole business is storing</text><text start="669.42" dur="4.8">identity data in in credit scoring data</text><text start="671.82" dur="5.639">about me and so that should tell you how</text><text start="674.22" dur="5.52">broken the security Paradigm of of uh</text><text start="677.459" dur="4.32">web 2 and before data is and I think</text><text start="679.74" dur="3.599">that people don&apos;t even realize it uh</text><text start="681.779" dur="4.56">because it&apos;s like a fish being in water</text><text start="683.339" dur="5.521">like you don&apos;t even realize that uh you</text><text start="686.339" dur="4.081">know it&apos;s water around us there&apos;s</text><text start="688.86" dur="2.76">there&apos;s everyone&apos;s storing all of my</text><text start="690.42" dur="3.06">data all the time it&apos;s like all we&apos;ve</text><text start="691.62" dur="3.06">ever known so there&apos;s a little bit of an</text><text start="693.48" dur="3.06">opportunity to show people that there&apos;s</text><text start="694.68" dur="3.599">another world that&apos;s possible here</text><text start="696.54" dur="3.12">yeah and a lot of it came from like when</text><text start="698.279" dur="2.941">internet standards were coming out when</text><text start="699.66" dur="3.239">when apps were starting to become a</text><text start="701.22" dur="3.78">dominant force in like the web 2 era</text><text start="702.899" dur="4.201">there was no standard way of doing</text><text start="705.0" dur="3.48">user-controlled identity so every</text><text start="707.1" dur="3.239">service just was like okay I have to</text><text start="708.48" dur="4.08">onboard a new in some way shape or form</text><text start="710.339" dur="4.261">get you onto this app or service here</text><text start="712.56" dur="4.14">fill in you know your name your last</text><text start="714.6" dur="4.14">name your username your password so</text><text start="716.7" dur="3.9">every app just slowly began to have a</text><text start="718.74" dur="3.42">different version of you and then all of</text><text start="720.6" dur="3.78">them built moats around those particular</text><text start="722.16" dur="4.859">versions of you and then it wasn&apos;t until</text><text start="724.38" dur="3.72">later on that user controlled identity</text><text start="727.019" dur="2.281">standards kind of came into the play</text><text start="728.1" dur="3.0">where it&apos;s like okay what if we flip</text><text start="729.3" dur="3.539">this model and what if the user just</text><text start="731.1" dur="3.96">presents themselves but a lot of it came</text><text start="732.839" dur="4.321">from like everything being built so</text><text start="735.06" dur="4.38">quickly and just that became the moat</text><text start="737.16" dur="4.739">like user user data just became them up</text><text start="739.44" dur="4.38">for a lot of these apps and services</text><text start="741.899" dur="4.201">so yeah I mean it&apos;s worth stating that</text><text start="743.82" dur="4.68">if if each app isn&apos;t building its own</text><text start="746.1" dur="4.14">mode then what happens is that all web 3</text><text start="748.5" dur="3.72">apps are building up their own data</text><text start="750.24" dur="4.32">modes together and I think what&apos;s really</text><text start="752.22" dur="4.44">exciting for for me about that is that</text><text start="754.56" dur="4.98">there&apos;s been a whole era of web 2</text><text start="756.66" dur="4.2">applications that uh have just cornered</text><text start="759.54" dur="3.06">their categories because they have such</text><text start="760.86" dur="3.779">big data modes and no one can compete</text><text start="762.6" dur="3.84">with them anymore I&apos;m I&apos;m sort of sub</text><text start="764.639" dur="3.301">tweeting Facebook and Twitter and all</text><text start="766.44" dur="3.18">these other social networks that have</text><text start="767.94" dur="4.139">this network effect where all my friends</text><text start="769.62" dur="3.6">are in Twitter and uh because of that</text><text start="772.079" dur="2.88">I&apos;m going to be at Twitter and because</text><text start="773.22" dur="3.059">of because of that all my friends are at</text><text start="774.959" dur="3.301">Twitter there&apos;s like this infinite Loop</text><text start="776.279" dur="4.081">of this network effects that&apos;s being</text><text start="778.26" dur="3.3">climbed but you can imagine someone I</text><text start="780.36" dur="3.84">don&apos;t know let&apos;s say lens protocol</text><text start="781.56" dur="4.92">building a web 3 social network and</text><text start="784.2" dur="3.84">making the social graph open source so</text><text start="786.48" dur="3.72">that anyone can derive from it and then</text><text start="788.04" dur="4.62">anyone who starts a web 3 social app can</text><text start="790.2" dur="4.259">just start on third base because they&apos;ve</text><text start="792.66" dur="3.78">got all of that data and network effects</text><text start="794.459" dur="4.44">there and so I think that it really</text><text start="796.44" dur="4.86">builds a more Pro consumer and pro</text><text start="798.899" dur="4.081">citizen web when you can take your data</text><text start="801.3" dur="3.659">from site to site and you&apos;re not locked</text><text start="802.98" dur="3.539">into these little you know these little</text><text start="804.959" dur="3.06">uh walled Gardens</text><text start="806.519" dur="4.081">and that&apos;s exactly what it is too from</text><text start="808.019" dur="3.901">the crypto space it&apos;s like we have a lot</text><text start="810.6" dur="3.419">of these different apps you could use</text><text start="811.92" dur="3.12">that rely on the same smart contracts</text><text start="814.019" dur="3.601">but are just kind of different front</text><text start="815.04" dur="3.9">ends different experiencer folks but the</text><text start="817.62" dur="3.12">second you go to that other front end</text><text start="818.94" dur="3.48">that other application it&apos;s kind of the</text><text start="820.74" dur="3.24">same rails behind everything the smart</text><text start="822.42" dur="3.719">contracts that are on like let&apos;s say the</text><text start="823.98" dur="3.12">ethereum blockchain for example and like</text><text start="826.139" dur="3.781">you&apos;re saying with this so you could</text><text start="827.1" dur="5.82">have you know these open social media</text><text start="829.92" dur="6.719">protocols where you can have uh you know</text><text start="832.92" dur="5.4">the green pill social space where you</text><text start="836.639" dur="2.88">know you take a user kind of brings</text><text start="838.32" dur="2.819">their posts followers and everything</text><text start="839.519" dur="4.141">with them I could have you know a</text><text start="841.139" dur="4.561">different social media app and it&apos;s all</text><text start="843.66" dur="3.239">the same data that&apos;s being brought back</text><text start="845.7" dur="3.12">and forth but we&apos;re just kind of</text><text start="846.899" dur="3.841">different purpose-built different themes</text><text start="848.82" dur="3.9">uh different Services we may have on</text><text start="850.74" dur="3.659">each application but the underlying data</text><text start="852.72" dur="3.78">is just coming to each one it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="854.399" dur="4.44">unlocked as part of that equation and it</text><text start="856.5" dur="4.2">really gets rid of those bad incentives</text><text start="858.839" dur="3.481">like for hoarding data and like like</text><text start="860.7" dur="3.06">you&apos;re saying you and I can you know we</text><text start="862.32" dur="3.84">go to Twitter because we know that&apos;s</text><text start="863.76" dur="4.8">where all of our tweets are all of our</text><text start="866.16" dur="5.96">followers are all of our network data is</text><text start="868.56" dur="6.24">but in this kind of new open world of of</text><text start="872.12" dur="4.06">unlocked data and user control data it</text><text start="874.8" dur="3.12">doesn&apos;t matter the front end because all</text><text start="876.18" dur="3.779">that kind of comes with you and these</text><text start="877.92" dur="3.0">these standards are also these data</text><text start="879.959" dur="2.701">formats and standards are all</text><text start="880.92" dur="3.24">interoperable is that you know my</text><text start="882.66" dur="3.6">platform and your platform read the same</text><text start="884.16" dur="3.84">thing and understand the same language</text><text start="886.26" dur="4.439">uh these standards are almost like the</text><text start="888.0" dur="4.86">battle fish for data</text><text start="890.699" dur="5.161">so maybe let&apos;s let&apos;s dive in on one of</text><text start="892.86" dur="4.74">those specific standards and uh it&apos;s</text><text start="895.86" dur="3.96">sign in with ethereum that I hear you</text><text start="897.6" dur="3.479">always talking about so is this like I</text><text start="899.82" dur="2.94">go to an app and instead of just</text><text start="901.079" dur="3.721">connecting my wallet I actually sign in</text><text start="902.76" dur="4.199">with ethereum and then the app gets some</text><text start="904.8" dur="5.099">sort of data about me</text><text start="906.959" dur="4.38">so the center of the theorem standard a</text><text start="909.899" dur="4.081">lot of it deals specifically with like</text><text start="911.339" dur="5.101">how do you first how do you prevent big</text><text start="913.98" dur="3.719">login uh is a joke we use kind of</text><text start="916.44" dur="3.54">internally and sometimes talk about is</text><text start="917.699" dur="4.5">like how do you go away from large login</text><text start="919.98" dur="3.78">providers where if you were using a</text><text start="922.199" dur="3.541">Google account to sign in with things</text><text start="923.76" dur="3.66">and Google ever decided to pull the rug</text><text start="925.74" dur="3.3">on you you wouldn&apos;t just lose access to</text><text start="927.42" dur="3.359">Google services you&apos;d also lose access</text><text start="929.04" dur="3.84">to everything you signed in with Google</text><text start="930.779" dur="3.3">too so every time you hit that sign with</text><text start="932.88" dur="2.819">Google button even if it&apos;s a total</text><text start="934.079" dur="3.0">third-party service you lose access to</text><text start="935.699" dur="3.541">that Google account you just lost your</text><text start="937.079" dur="4.32">identifier the thing you&apos;re using to</text><text start="939.24" dur="4.2">tell that app who you are and the sign</text><text start="941.399" dur="3.601">with ethereum case these are Keys you</text><text start="943.44" dur="4.199">control and these these ethereum</text><text start="945.0" dur="6.0">accounts you that only you control to</text><text start="947.639" dur="4.741">get into these apps and services and a</text><text start="951.0" dur="4.38">big part of what we&apos;re doing with that</text><text start="952.38" dur="5.28">is kind of Bridging the Gap from</text><text start="955.38" dur="3.66">actually first it&apos;d probably be good if</text><text start="957.66" dur="3.0">I talked about the difference between</text><text start="959.04" dur="2.76">connecting a wallet and signing in with</text><text start="960.66" dur="2.16">ethereum let&apos;s do it yeah because</text><text start="961.8" dur="3.479">they&apos;re yeah because there are two</text><text start="962.82" dur="4.74">different actions that sometimes get um</text><text start="965.279" dur="4.56">mixed up a little bit sometimes so when</text><text start="967.56" dur="4.5">you connect a wallet to an app or a dab</text><text start="969.839" dur="4.5">rather that you&apos;re not kind of giving</text><text start="972.06" dur="4.68">anything that the DAP anything other</text><text start="974.339" dur="4.56">than the means to serve you a</text><text start="976.74" dur="3.839">transaction like some kind of on-chain</text><text start="978.899" dur="3.901">transaction saying yep you know you&apos;re</text><text start="980.579" dur="3.541">trying to make this trade you know here</text><text start="982.8" dur="4.02">here&apos;s the transaction to make that</text><text start="984.12" dur="5.579">trade when you&apos;re signing a message</text><text start="986.82" dur="5.699">you&apos;re actually proving you are the</text><text start="989.699" dur="5.341">owner of that account</text><text start="992.519" dur="3.781">and by doing that the app can trust that</text><text start="995.04" dur="3.06">yes it&apos;s you</text><text start="996.3" dur="3.959">it could potentially remember things</text><text start="998.1" dur="4.2">about you like preferences for example</text><text start="1000.259" dur="3.541">the goal obviously being to move this</text><text start="1002.3" dur="3.719">towards the user bringing that all that</text><text start="1003.8" dur="4.68">with them but it&apos;s the first step in</text><text start="1006.019" dur="4.62">having experiences of gaps rival that of</text><text start="1008.48" dur="4.2">traditional apps that the DAP can</text><text start="1010.639" dur="3.721">remember something about you that you</text><text start="1012.68" dur="4.019">know when you set up a profile it&apos;s all</text><text start="1014.36" dur="3.539">there for you when you come back one of</text><text start="1016.699" dur="3.961">the good early examples of this was</text><text start="1017.899" dur="4.44">openc so in openc you could use openc by</text><text start="1020.66" dur="3.659">just connecting a wallet and you know</text><text start="1022.339" dur="3.781">using the nft marketplace and trading</text><text start="1024.319" dur="4.441">things but the second you want to set up</text><text start="1026.12" dur="3.78">a profile on openc it requires you to</text><text start="1028.76" dur="2.64">sign a message</text><text start="1029.9" dur="3.659">and that message is like you know I&apos;m</text><text start="1031.4" dur="4.26">signing into openc a couple of other</text><text start="1033.559" dur="3.36">details and then once you sign that</text><text start="1035.66" dur="2.639">message opens he&apos;s like oh this person</text><text start="1036.919" dur="3.54">controls that account</text><text start="1038.299" dur="3.54">there that they are now logged in and we</text><text start="1040.459" dur="2.581">could remember these profile details</text><text start="1041.839" dur="3.421">about them so when they come back it&apos;s</text><text start="1043.04" dur="3.84">all there for them when they get back</text><text start="1045.26" dur="3.36">and with the whole sign with ethereum</text><text start="1046.88" dur="4.62">initiative was was standardizing that</text><text start="1048.62" dur="4.26">message format that you know when you</text><text start="1051.5" dur="3.179">get served that thing in your wallet</text><text start="1052.88" dur="4.2">that&apos;s like sign this message</text><text start="1054.679" dur="4.74">it&apos;s very much how do you standardize</text><text start="1057.08" dur="4.979">that so that wallets can then tell the</text><text start="1059.419" dur="3.901">user hey you&apos;re signing into this where</text><text start="1062.059" dur="3.181">it&apos;s getting like just that much better</text><text start="1063.32" dur="3.359">with ux so that the wallet&apos;s not like</text><text start="1065.24" dur="2.46">sign the random message but instead</text><text start="1066.679" dur="2.761">saying</text><text start="1067.7" dur="2.58">you&apos;re actually signing into the zapper</text><text start="1069.44" dur="3.3">service</text><text start="1070.28" dur="4.5">and even providing users with better ux</text><text start="1072.74" dur="3.84">around signing in such as domain binding</text><text start="1074.78" dur="3.36">and what that means is that if you&apos;re on</text><text start="1076.58" dur="3.78">a phishing site that&apos;s trying to scam</text><text start="1078.14" dur="3.48">you and it&apos;s asking you to sign off on</text><text start="1080.36" dur="3.12">something that doesn&apos;t match the site</text><text start="1081.62" dur="3.84">you&apos;re on like if it&apos;s a phishing site</text><text start="1083.48" dur="4.68">for openc for example the wallet being</text><text start="1085.46" dur="3.78">able to warn you and

the evidence for that information</text><text start="1650.659" dur="3.781">um but I think where it gets even more</text><text start="1652.7" dur="4.079">interesting is when you could start</text><text start="1654.44" dur="4.739">using these off-chain credentials</text><text start="1656.779" dur="4.741">uh on chain in different ways like let&apos;s</text><text start="1659.179" dur="5.1">say you have a fully autonomous system</text><text start="1661.52" dur="4.259">with smart contracts like imagine if you</text><text start="1664.279" dur="3.061">could just use those credentials with</text><text start="1665.779" dur="3.541">that smart contract now and that smart</text><text start="1667.34" dur="3.36">contract is no like you know has to have</text><text start="1669.32" dur="3.0">a Twitter

dur="4.439">information on chain in some efficient</text><text start="1680.6" dur="4.86">way so there&apos;s like a huge like mix and</text><text start="1683.179" dur="4.86">match design space of what can be off</text><text start="1685.46" dur="4.5">chain what could be on-chain but I&apos;m</text><text start="1688.039" dur="3.481">more along the lines of like things in</text><text start="1689.96" dur="3.78">terms of like uh personal information</text><text start="1691.52" dur="3.6">remaining off chain in different ways so</text><text start="1693.74" dur="2.819">long as it could be privacy preserving</text><text start="1695.12" dur="3.299">at the end of the day that the user kind</text><text start="1696.559" dur="3.901">of has full control over the information</text><text start="1698.419" dur="3.481">uh you might have some emerging things</text><text start="1700.46" dur="3.0">to somehow get that on chain in a</text><text start="1701.9" dur="2.82">privacy preserving way but I think</text><text start="1703.46" dur="2.699">that&apos;s just kind of the core of it as</text><text start="1704.72" dur="3.48">long as that information is protected</text><text start="1706.159" dur="4.561">for that person</text><text start="1708.2" dur="4.5">then kind of the format is</text><text start="1710.72" dur="3.9">whatever&apos;s easier as long as that</text><text start="1712.7" dur="3.66">information is protected and we should</text><text start="1714.62" dur="4.86">say that like you know for on-chain data</text><text start="1716.36" dur="4.319">there is ways to protect the Privacy uh</text><text start="1719.48" dur="3.559">I mean I&apos;m thinking of zero knowledge</text><text start="1720.679" dur="5.1">proofs uh when I say that out loud but</text><text start="1723.039" dur="5.801">uh yeah I know that when the d-soc paper</text><text start="1725.779" dur="5.64">came out this was a big a big</text><text start="1728.84" dur="4.62">controversy that that happened</text><text start="1731.419" dur="3.481">yeah cell bound tokens that was that was</text><text start="1733.46" dur="2.76">probably the one burning question was</text><text start="1734.9" dur="3.12">like</text><text start="1736.22" dur="3.839">how do we make sure that whatever is</text><text start="1738.02" dur="4.139">going on chain stamped in The Ledger of</text><text

dur="4.14">leaked in any possible way</text><text start="1746.24" dur="4.02">and that&apos;s probably</text><text start="1748.46" dur="3.3">still one of the most important things</text><text start="1750.26" dur="2.7">especially for the folks experimenting</text><text start="1751.76" dur="3.24">with launching credentials to just</text><text start="1752.96" dur="4.02">always make sure designing for privacy</text><text start="1755.0" dur="3.86">first is super important because you</text><text start="1756.98" dur="4.319">don&apos;t want to visit this immutable stamp</text><text start="1758.86" dur="4.419">yeah I mean and this is not like when</text><text start="1761.299" dur="3.48">you&apos;re designing for a web 2 app where</text><text start="1763.279" dur="4.321">like the server goes down and it goes</text><text start="1764.779" dur="4.981">away the blockchain is forever so uh</text><text start="1767.6" dur="4.62">well you know depends on the blockchain</text><text start="1769.76" dur="4.38">but uh the ethereum maina I think we can</text><text start="1772.22" dur="3.9">assume is reached escape velocity and</text><text start="1774.14" dur="3.0">it&apos;s going to be around forever so</text><text start="1776.12" dur="2.46">um you know you just have to take some</text><text start="1777.14" dur="2.82">privacy way more seriously because</text><text start="1778.58" dur="4.319">you&apos;re going through a one-way door when</text><text start="1779.96" dur="5.04">you deploy something to a blockchain</text><text start="1782.899" dur="4.081">yeah exactly and I think that&apos;s as long</text><text start="1785.0" dur="3.48">as that&apos;s kind of the core of folks</text><text start="1786.98" dur="2.76">looking to do identity on chain as long</text><text start="1788.48" dur="3.72">as that&apos;s at the core of their their</text><text start="1789.74" dur="4.439">principles and reasoning and philosophy</text><text start="1792.2" dur="3.12">around it then then it&apos;s cool like as</text><text start="1794.179" dur="2.641">long as we&apos;re just not personal</text><text start="1795.32" dur="3.66">information on chain that&apos;s not</text><text start="1796.82" dur="4.2">encrypted not private by default just</text><text start="1798.98" dur="4.439">very scary uh when it&apos;s immutable like</text><text start="1801.02" dur="3.96">that but uh there are folks a lot of</text><text start="1803.419" dur="2.701">folks working in that space right now</text><text start="1804.98" dur="3.24">and making sure that that is a</text><text start="1806.12" dur="2.88">possibility so definitely hats off to</text><text start="1808.22" dur="2.699">them</text><text start="1809.0" dur="4.5">yeah totally</text><text start="1810.919" dur="4.62">um what are the</text><text start="1813.5" dur="4.679">what are the categories of things that</text><text start="1815.539" dur="5.101">sign in with ethereum enables that that</text><text start="1818.179" dur="4.98">you&apos;re most excited about right now</text><text start="1820.64" dur="5.639">I think one of the things that I&apos;m a big</text><text start="1823.159" dur="4.681">fan of is uh how do you log in on behalf</text><text start="1826.279" dur="2.941">of a Dao</text><text start="1827.84" dur="2.579">I think</text><text start="1829.22" dur="4.26">um this has been a little bit of a</text><text start="1830.419" dur="4.74">problem for a while where if you have a</text><text start="1833.48" dur="3.48">multi-sig or a multi-sig while it&apos;s a</text><text start="1835.159" dur="3.481">like let&apos;s say uh you know an order a</text><text start="1836.96" dur="3.24">multi-sig wallet you just need multiple</text><text start="1838.64" dur="2.7">people to sign off on something or</text><text start="1840.2" dur="2.219">multiple wallets to sign off on</text><text start="1841.34" dur="3.54">something to make a transaction go</text><text start="1842.419" dur="4.38">through in a multi-sig wallet so if you</text><text start="1844.88" dur="4.44">know you and I set up a multi-sig and</text><text start="1846.799" dur="4.081">with the you know we can make it two up</text><text start="1849.32" dur="4.14">two out of two so both of us have to</text><text start="1850.88" dur="3.779">sign and approve something in order to</text><text start="1853.46" dur="3.18">make something go</text><text start="1854.659" dur="4.321">but this has been a problem for a lot of</text><text start="1856.64" dur="4.98">dows and a lot of organizations or even</text><text start="1858.98" dur="5.699">individuals who use multisigs is how do</text><text start="1861.62" dur="5.159">you sign into apps or dapps using that</text><text start="1864.679" dur="4.081">multi-sig you know traditionally in</text><text start="1866.779" dur="4.26">corporate world it&apos;s like we always have</text><text start="1868.76" dur="4.799">the designated social media person but</text><text start="1871.039" dur="4.74">it&apos;s one person representing the</text><text start="1873.559" dur="4.681">organization it&apos;s not like a hundred of</text><text start="1875.779" dur="4.201">us are sitting around a computer and uh</text><text start="1878.24" dur="4.2">you know all 100 of us have our hand on</text><text start="1879.98" dur="4.679">the mouse and clicking on things on the</text><text start="1882.44" dur="4.859">Opera service it&apos;s always one person and</text><text start="1884.659" dur="4.921">this really never translated well yet in</text><text start="1887.299" dur="4.26">terms of dapps where multi-cigs can you</text><text start="1889.58" dur="4.92">know just take off-chain actions and</text><text start="1891.559" dur="5.041">have an account on a platform folks did</text><text start="1894.5" dur="3.6">it in a couple of bespoke ways but um</text><text start="1896.6" dur="4.26">one of the things I&apos;m super excited</text><text start="1898.1" dur="4.62">about is if like the workflow where a</text><text start="1900.86" dur="3.9">multi-sig is able to say</text><text start="1902.72" dur="3.6">these Keys these these people are the</text><text start="1904.76" dur="4.139">ones that can log in on behalf of this</text><text start="1906.32" dur="4.8">multi-sig so if a dow had a member</text><text start="1908.899" dur="3.601">that you know can control the social</text><text start="1911.12" dur="3.12">media accounts like the decentralized</text><text start="1912.5" dur="3.899">social media accounts if a dow had a</text><text start="1914.24" dur="5.46">member that did like the proposal</text><text start="1916.399" dur="5.821">drafting uh in certain instances or even</text><text start="1919.7" dur="4.74">managed the profile of that Dao on a</text><text start="1922.22" dur="4.5">governance platform that now there&apos;s a</text><text start="1924.44" dur="4.979">workflow where an individual can do that</text><text start="1926.72" dur="4.5">the Dow or multi-sig can say yep that&apos;s</text><text start="1929.419" dur="3.421">the individual that can log in and when</text><text start="1931.22" dur="4.199">that user goes to sign in with ethereum</text><text start="1932.84" dur="5.16">the DAP can ask them hey did you mean as</text><text start="1935.419" dur="4.86">yourself so let&apos;s say me Rocco or on</text><text start="1938.0" dur="4.38">behalf of the multi-sig or one of these</text><text start="1940.279" dur="5.12">multi-cigs that you are a delegate of</text><text start="1942.38" dur="6.419">and I&apos;m also very excited to like start</text><text start="1945.399" dur="5.681">splitting that out so you could have one</text><text start="1948.799" dur="4.441">person be the social media person you</text><text start="1951.08" dur="4.44">could have one person manage the Dow</text><text start="1953.24" dur="3.96">profile on this website and have these</text><text start="1955.52" dur="3.12">very narrow scopes for each of these</text><text start="1957.2" dur="2.94">things</text><text start="1958.64" dur="3.779">um before this was a very difficult</text><text start="1960.14" dur="4.74">thing but thankfully working with the</text><text start="1962.419" dur="3.901">folks over at gnosis safe this is uh now</text><text start="1964.88" dur="2.94">been enabled which is great but now it&apos;s</text><text start="1966.32" dur="4.079">like what are the even deeper use cases</text><text start="1967.82" dur="4.92">of like single delegation to certain</text><text start="1970.399" dur="4.14">apps or certain verticals</text><text start="1972.74" dur="3.659">um again social media app like the</text><text start="1974.539" dur="3.541">profile management app The Proposal</text><text start="1976.399" dur="3.301">management app that each individual can</text><text start="1978.08" dur="3.0">now represent a different thing similar</text><text start="1979.7" dur="3.0">to How We Do It In traditional companies</text><text start="1981.08" dur="4.079">like there&apos;s a social media person this</text><text start="1982.7" dur="6.06">person managing this account but now</text><text start="1985.159" dur="5.461">like kind of fully web3 enabled uh and</text><text start="1988.76" dur="3.899">having this design space happen and also</text><text start="1990.62" dur="4.439">again just using wallets and I think</text><text start="1992.659" dur="4.081">that&apos;s a core basis for a lot of what</text><text start="1995.059" dur="4.021">excites me about sign with ethereum even</text><text start="1996.74" dur="4.74">just beyond the identity stuff is how do</text><text start="1999.08" dur="3.24">you take these wallets that folks are</text><text start="2001.48" dur="3.419">using</text><text start="2002.32" dur="4.26">and Beyond just Financial transactions</text><text start="2004.899" dur="3.361">what else can you do with them</text><text start="2006.58" dur="3.24">I think that&apos;s the core of a lot of this</text><text start="2008.26" dur="3.06">work for all the folks working on</text><text start="2009.82" dur="3.42">identity for all the folks working on</text><text start="2011.32" dur="4.68">decentralized data is how do you take</text><text start="2013.24" dur="4.26">you know individuals using wallets and</text><text start="2016.0" dur="4.26">say hey wait there&apos;s a ton more you can</text><text start="2017.5" dur="4.919">do with this that is this mode of like</text><text start="2020.26" dur="4.019">Sovereign operation Beyond just finances</text><text start="2022.419" dur="2.941">and I mean we have something like full</text><text start="2024.279" dur="2.701">user control</text><text start="2025.36" dur="4.08">yeah totally I mean as someone who&apos;s</text><text start="2026.98" dur="3.9">worked on Enterprise oh man am I I&apos;m</text><text start="2029.44" dur="2.66">getting I&apos;m shuttering but I&apos;m thinking</text><text start="2030.88" dur="3.72">about myself</text><text start="2032.1" dur="4.66">uh but you know Enterprise access</text><text start="2034.6" dur="4.14">management was like something that there</text><text start="2036.76" dur="4.5">was whole teams at this Corporation I</text><text start="2038.74" dur="4.02">worked at and um you know just having</text><text start="2041.26" dur="3.299">that all be open source and</text><text start="2042.76" dur="3.6">permissionless I think is really a huge</text><text start="2044.559" dur="3.78">step forward but you know when I think</text><text start="2046.36" dur="3.72">about what decentralized identity is</text><text start="2048.339" dur="4.5">going to enable I think about things</text><text start="2050.08" dur="5.039">like web3 social being able to take my</text><text start="2052.839" dur="4.08">social graph from site to site or under</text><text start="2055.119" dur="3.121">collateralized lending or civil</text><text start="2056.919" dur="4.2">resistance you know like a little bit</text><text start="2058.24" dur="4.439">more consumer oriented applications but</text><text start="2061.119" dur="3.72">you know it&apos;s great it&apos;s it&apos;s amazing to</text><text start="2062.679" dur="3.96">have the sort of consumer stuff and the</text><text start="2064.839" dur="4.141">Enterprise stuff on the same structure</text><text start="2066.639" dur="3.96">because that enables you to do you know</text><text start="2068.98" dur="3.54">whatever Innovation you enable for your</text><text start="2070.599" dur="4.08">Dow can be enabled for you as an</text><text start="2072.52" dur="3.42">individual user and vice versa but I&apos;m</text><text start="2074.679" dur="3.121">wondering if there&apos;s anything that like</text><text start="2075.94" dur="3.179">category of more consumer oriented stuff</text><text start="2077.8" dur="4.2">that you&apos;re really excited about being</text><text start="2079.119" dur="4.441">built on top of sign in with ethereum</text><text start="2082.0" dur="3.0">no I think I think you kind of hit the</text><text start="2083.56" dur="4.079">nail on the head there especially around</text><text start="2085.0" dur="4.32">the social space is that the one thing</text><text start="2087.639" dur="4.681">that I Saw the space take a great turn</text><text start="2089.32" dur="4.98">I&apos;d say probably in the 2019 2020 was</text><text start="2092.32" dur="3.359">more into the social space and not even</text><text start="2094.3" dur="4.26">to social media just like pure</text><text start="2095.679" dur="4.201">interactions as individuals uh Beyond</text><text start="2098.56" dur="2.88">just the depth and can kind of make</text><text start="2099.88" dur="2.88">money go from point A to point B which</text><text start="2101.44" dur="3.84">is super important in its own right I</text><text start="2102.76" dur="4.92">never want to downplay uh like you know</text><text start="2105.28" dur="3.18">like the finance side of crypto but I</text><text start="2107.68" dur="3.36">think</text><text start="2108.46" dur="4.2">signing with ethereum really represents</text><text start="2111.04" dur="4.02">that other side of like those</text><text start="2112.66" dur="5.16">interactions those social interactions</text><text start="2115.06" dur="5.279">like decentralized social media</text><text start="2117.82" dur="3.72">um artists in the nft space and how we</text><text start="2120.339" dur="3.061">communicate</text><text start="2121.54" dur="3.96">I think that&apos;s kind of the world that&apos;s</text><text start="2123.4" dur="3.42">unlocked here outside the financial use</text><text start="2125.5" dur="3.599">cases like how do we start having these</text><text start="2126.82" dur="4.32">more contextual interactions in the</text><text start="2129.099" dur="3.841">space as opposed to just connecting a</text><text start="2131.14" dur="3.479">wallet and making a transaction how do</text><text start="2132.94" dur="3.179">we go levels deeper than that especially</text><text start="2134.619" dur="2.941">on the consumer side like that I think</text><text start="2136.119" dur="3.0">it&apos;s all the social interactions all the</text><text start="2137.56" dur="3.299">contextual interactions when you need</text><text start="2139.119" dur="3.661">just a little bit more</text><text start="2140.859" dur="4.381">of yourself</text><text start="2142.78" dur="4.62">than just the public key</text><text start="2145.24" dur="3.96">just the wallet I think is when this</text><text start="2147.4" dur="2.939">gets really really powerful and kind of</text><text start="2149.2" dur="3.0">signing with ethereum is just kind of</text><text start="2150.339" dur="4.02">that root of it it&apos;s just kind of the</text><text start="2152.2" dur="4.919">standard it&apos;s just a standard it enables</text><text start="2154.359" dur="3.901">all this but I think what it enables</text><text start="2157.119" dur="2.821">like we&apos;re talking about now those</text><text start="2158.26" dur="3.0">contextual interactions are super super</text><text start="2159.94" dur="2.88">important especially as the space</text><text

start="2167.44" dur="3.3">so uh I know that you spend a lot of</text><text start="2169.18" dur="3.6">time thinking about this and I know that</text><text start="2170.74" dur="3.9">because when we hang out uh we geek out</text><text start="2172.78" dur="3.9">about this a lot so I&apos;m wondering if you</text><text start="2174.64" dur="4.979">could take me into the future it&apos;s the</text><text start="2176.68" dur="5.82">end of 2022 right now say it&apos;s 20</text><text start="2179.619" dur="4.801">2032 it&apos;s 10 years from now is signing</text><text start="2182.5" dur="4.02">with ethereum is maximally successful</text><text start="2184.42" dur="4.4">what will the world look like what kind</text><text start="2186.52" dur="4.559">of impact will it have on the world</text><text start="2188.82" dur="3.759">I think if signing with ethereum is</text><text start="2191.079" dur="3.061">maximally successful we really have a</text><text start="2192.579" dur="3.0">world where large companies aren&apos;t</text><text start="2194.14" dur="4.14">extracting the value they are anymore</text><text start="2195.579" dur="4.981">from users I think it&apos;s a little bit of</text><text start="2198.28" dur="4.2">a Kind of Blue Skies but I think that&apos;s</text><text start="2200.56" dur="4.08">really the case because I think as we</text><text start="2202.48" dur="3.78">mentioned earlier now that users control</text><text start="2204.64" dur="3.36">their own identifier or have ways of</text><text start="2206.26" dur="3.359">doing it I think wallets get to the</text><text start="2208.0" dur="3.54">point where Key Management is a complete</text><text start="2209.619" dur="4.021">Breeze in terms of not like worrying</text><text start="2211.54" dur="3.42">about like oh no did I write those 12</text><text start="2213.64" dur="3.42">words somewhere I think we&apos;ve reached</text><text start="2214.96" dur="3.659">that point in that time where wallets</text><text start="2217.06" dur="4.5">have created such great experiences</text><text start="2218.619" dur="4.861">around like recovery around you know</text><text start="2221.56" dur="3.24">managing these things and I think we</text><text start="2223.48" dur="2.82">have this world where users are always</text><text start="2224.8" dur="3.48">in control their identifier is never</text><text start="2226.3" dur="4.68">worrying about a large company pulling</text><text start="2228.28" dur="4.86">the rug on them or having a data breach</text><text start="2230.98" dur="3.78">and instead are just worrying about new</text><text start="2233.14" dur="3.18">features that are dropping to make the</text><text start="2234.76" dur="4.26">apps and services that much more better</text><text start="2236.32" dur="5.58">for users that we&apos;re not constantly in</text><text start="2239.02" dur="5.16">this world of fear of oh no is something</text><text start="2241.9" dur="4.08">going to happen to my data oh no I</text><text start="2244.18" dur="3.659">forgot about that account five years ago</text><text start="2245.98" dur="3.9">and now that app or service is shut down</text><text start="2247.839" dur="3.841">or the their data is now posted on the</text><text start="2249.88" dur="3.3">dark web somewhere I think it&apos;s less on</text><text start="2251.68" dur="4.679">that and more about the experiences</text><text start="2253.18" dur="5.64">we&apos;re talking about more on a what app</text><text start="2256.359" dur="4.201">you know am I going to be using today</text><text start="2258.82" dur="5.039">that&apos;s offering me so much value and and</text><text start="2260.56" dur="5.279">social value and if I don&apos;t like it that</text><text start="2263.859" dur="4.621">within 10 seconds I can move over to the</text><text start="2265.839" dur="4.081">next platform and the experience is</text><text start="2268.48" dur="3.119">nearly the same in terms of the things</text><text start="2269.92" dur="3.48">I&apos;ve brought with me to this platform</text><text start="2271.599" dur="3.121">and these platforms are just purely</text><text start="2273.4" dur="3.48">competing on services and what they</text><text start="2274.72" dur="4.56">could offer the user instead of being</text><text start="2276.88" dur="3.959">extractive from the user that it&apos;s more</text><text start="2279.28" dur="3.48">focused on the user and more focused on</text><text start="2280.839" dur="4.921">benefiting users than benefiting the</text><text start="2282.76" dur="5.339">bottom lines and that&apos;s what&apos;s great</text><text start="2285.76" dur="5.4">about the space is that it it</text><text start="2288.099" dur="5.52">bends all incentives towards that on the</text><text start="2291.16" dur="4.74">experience rather than how extractive a</text><text start="2293.619" dur="3.421">service can be and I think the 10-year</text><text start="2295.9" dur="3.0">view is</text><text start="2297.04" dur="3.72">if you get to that point if these</text><text start="2298.9" dur="3.959">standards are working as intended and if</text><text start="2300.76" dur="4.26">Key Management is in place to make make</text><text start="2302.859" dur="3.961">it a breeze and I know we all kind of</text><text start="2305.02" dur="4.44">use the default of like can my mom use</text><text start="2306.82" dur="4.259">this and I think at 10 years absolutely</text><text start="2309.46" dur="3.18">I think that&apos;ll be the case I&apos;m very I&apos;m</text><text start="2311.079" dur="2.941">very hopeful for the wallet space in</text><text start="2312.64" dur="3.3">terms of getting it right for users</text><text start="2314.02" dur="3.48">making sure the design patterns are</text><text start="2315.94" dur="4.139">great making sure that recovery is great</text><text start="2317.5" dur="4.68">and I think if we&apos;re all there I think</text><text start="2320.079" dur="4.081">we&apos;re really in a great spot with how we</text><text start="2322.18" dur="4.2">interact on the internet how we take</text><text start="2324.16" dur="4.74">control of ourselves on the internet how</text><text start="2326.38" dur="4.979">trust gets redefined on the internet and</text><text start="2328.9" dur="4.98">how experiences evolve as well</text><text start="2331.359" dur="4.74">beautiful well uh is there anything I</text><text start="2333.88" dur="4.26">didn&apos;t ask that you want to say or uh uh</text><text start="2336.099" dur="4.74">you know like is anything anything else</text><text start="2338.14" dur="4.68">that you want to say before we wrap</text><text start="2340.839" dur="3.421">I just want to say that um</text><text start="2342.82" dur="3.66">I think what often goes under</text><text start="2344.26" dur="5.76">appreciated in the space</text><text start="2346.48" dur="6.48">are the folks working on Open Standards</text><text start="2350.02" dur="4.62">that we talk a lot about</text><text start="2352.96" dur="2.82">um generally my new standards drop I</text><text start="2354.64" dur="3.78">know folks are talking about account</text><text start="2355.78" dur="4.62">abstraction uh Focus are talking about</text><text start="2358.42" dur="4.08">like what&apos;s the new the new thing going</text><text start="2360.4" dur="3.78">on right now is like I think the human</text><text start="2362.5" dur="3.3">coordination costs to make to bring</text><text start="2364.18" dur="4.38">these standards to life like signing</text><text start="2365.8" dur="4.62">with ethereum often goes unnoticed I</text><text start="2368.56" dur="3.9">also want to shout out to like all the</text><text start="2370.42" dur="3.72">EIP editors the folks who have been</text><text start="2372.46" dur="3.06">keeping the ethereum standards going and</text><text start="2374.14" dur="3.54">making sure that they&apos;re reviewed making</text><text start="2375.52" dur="4.02">sure there&apos;s a process for them because</text><text start="2377.68" dur="3.24">all this stuff is built on Open</text><text start="2379.54" dur="2.94">Standards and the nice thing about the</text><text start="2380.92" dur="3.54">space is that it moves at the speed of</text><text start="2382.48" dur="3.84">light in terms of like a bunch of</text><text start="2384.46" dur="3.18">companies coordinating on bringing</text><text start="2386.32" dur="3.96">something like sign with ethereum to</text><text start="2387.64" dur="4.5">life bringing other standards to life</text><text start="2390.28" dur="3.72">really just making sure that everything</text><text start="2392.14" dur="4.38">works so seamlessly</text><text start="2394.0" dur="5.22">and I just want to definitely shout out</text><text start="2396.52" dur="5.339">to all the folks besides myself working</text><text start="2399.22" dur="4.5">on Open Standards using Open Standards</text><text start="2401.859" dur="3.541">to really try to give users a better</text><text start="2403.72" dur="3.119">experience than what&apos;s out there because</text><text start="2405.4" dur="4.439">there&apos;s a lot of human coordination</text><text start="2406.839" dur="6.601">costs to it and that coordination cost</text><text start="2409.839" dur="6.121">is uh it&apos;s definitely
