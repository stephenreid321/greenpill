dur="5.879">lived in New York here I was a reporter</text><text start="56.3" dur="8.62">covering social movements as well as the</text><text start="59.399" dur="8.341">early development of ethereum

old</text><text start="84.54" dur="3.96">questions about new technology and I</text><text start="86.64" dur="4.08">think you had me as a guest a year and a</text><text start="88.5" dur="4.4">half ago I sure did the tables have been</text><text start="90.72" dur="4.92">turned and I&apos;m also proud that that&apos;s</text><text start="92.9" dur="5.079">not only a podcast but also a

it</text><text start="108.78" dur="5.1">right now but I think that uh we wanted</text><text start="111.299" dur="5.121">to sort of expand out your asking old</text><text start="113.88" dur="5.099">question questions about new technology</text><text start="116.42" dur="6.58">and uh sort of do the same thing about</text><text start="118.979" dur="6.24">Dows and web3 and put them into a frame</text><text start="123.0" dur="5.179">of the larger history of social</text><text start="125.219" dur="6.181">movements Technologies and and</text><text start="128.179" dur="5.341">co-organizing before Dallas happened and</text><text start="131.4" dur="6.18">so I know that you&apos;ve done a lot of work</text><text start="133.52" dur="6.16">preceding web3 on co-ops and exit to</text><text start="137.58" dur="3.299">community and you know I&apos;d be curious if</text><text start="139.68" dur="2.279">we could kind of pull that thread and</text><text start="140.879" dur="6.061">you can tell us what you&apos;re interested</text><text start="141.959" dur="8.28">in there yeah to me this question of of</text><text start="146.94" dur="5.4">web3 is a kind of opportunity that we&apos;ve</text><text start="150.239" dur="5.821">had all along it&apos;s it&apos;s part of a much</text><text start="152.34" dur="6.84">longer story about how we own and govern</text><text start="156.06" dur="5.16">the economy it&apos;s something that goes</text><text start="159.18" dur="4.74">back you know you can tell the story</text><text start="161.22" dur="4.44">going back all of human history you</text><text start="163.92" dur="4.38">could also start for instance at the</text><text start="165.66" dur="4.2">rise of the corporation at the same time</text><text start="168.3" dur="2.659">that modern corporations were being</text><text start="169.86" dur="4.82">developed</text><text start="170.959" dur="5.801">an another model an alternative to</text><text start="174.68" dur="4.059">investor ownership was also being</text><text start="176.76" dur="4.559">developed called The Cooperative</text><text start="178.739" dur="4.08">business model a form of business that</text><text start="181.319" dur="2.721">is owned and governed by the</text><text start="182.819" dur="5.361">participants</text><text start="184.04" dur="7.779">and uh and and these have been parallel</text><text start="188.18" dur="6.22">though one has gotten accumulated a lot</text><text start="191.819" dur="4.621">more power than the other even though</text><text start="194.4" dur="3.839">cooperatives have been actually a really</text><text start="196.44" dur="4.019">really important part of the development</text><text start="198.239" dur="6.901">of the modern world often kind of behind</text><text start="200.459" dur="7.081">the scenes so when I uh uh as I&apos;ve been</text><text start="205.14" dur="4.62">following the rise of of</text><text start="207.54" dur="3.96">um crypto I&apos;ve been I&apos;ve been also</text><text start="209.76" dur="4.44">working with people trying to bring the</text><text start="211.5" dur="4.8">Cooperative movement into the into the</text><text start="214.2" dur="3.48">tech economy into the into the online</text><text start="216.3" dur="3.96">World</text><text start="217.68" dur="5.639">um and uh seeing the kind of parallels</text><text start="220.26" dur="6.96">there the thing that got me first really</text><text start="223.319" dur="6.241">interested in in the crypto world I was</text><text start="227.22" dur="6.36">doing my book tour for a book on Occupy</text><text start="229.56" dur="6.48">Wall Street uh uh in uh in early 2014</text><text start="233.58" dur="4.799">and I had to stop in San Francisco and a</text><text start="236.04" dur="3.9">friend there said you&apos;ve got her you</text><text start="238.379" dur="3.601">gotta look at this thing that just came</text><text start="239.94" dur="4.799">out and it was the ethereum white paper</text><text start="241.98" dur="4.619">Now by that time I&apos;d heard about Bitcoin</text><text start="244.739" dur="3.601">and things like that that was kind of</text><text start="246.599" dur="3.241">floating around Occupy Wall Street as</text><text start="248.34" dur="4.5">well actually</text><text start="249.84" dur="6.359">um but ethereum struck me as something</text><text start="252.84" dur="7.079">different because here I&apos;d seen all this</text><text start="256.199" dur="6.361">this energy and and craving among young</text><text start="259.919" dur="5.041">people all over the world from Egypt to</text><text start="262.56" dur="4.8">you know here in New York uh to</text><text start="264.96" dur="5.88">experiment with new forms of democracy</text><text start="267.36" dur="6.0">and self-organizing uh and um and and</text><text start="270.84" dur="5.46">then those encampments of those 2011</text><text start="273.36" dur="5.04">protests have been cleared and in that</text><text start="276.3" dur="4.38">ethereum white paper it started me</text><text start="278.4" dur="4.5">thinking is this a place where that</text><text start="280.68" dur="5.94">experimentation can go forward can</text><text start="282.9" dur="6.18">continue in online space is this a place</text><text start="286.62" dur="6.299">too where this Cooperative movement this</text><text start="289.08" dur="6.54">this urge to uh share ownership and</text><text start="292.919" dur="4.381">governance to distribute value equally</text><text start="295.62" dur="4.62">to make sure that the people involved</text><text start="297.3" dur="5.22">have a voice in what they&apos;re doing can</text><text start="300.24" dur="5.399">continue in online space in a way it</text><text start="302.52" dur="4.32">hasn&apos;t really been able to so far so</text><text start="305.639" dur="4.801">it&apos;s just seemed to me like an</text><text start="306.84" dur="5.579">incredibly important site of struggle my</text><text start="310.44" dur="4.62">intro interest in cryptos not because I</text><text start="312.419" dur="4.741">think it by itself will save the world</text><text start="315.06" dur="3.96">or solve any of these problems but I</text><text start="317.16" dur="4.259">think it presents a really incredible</text><text start="319.02" dur="6.42">opportunity for what we might be able to</text><text start="321.419" dur="6.06">do for how this this ongoing story of of</text><text start="325.44" dur="5.88">a struggle between you know the</text><text start="327.479" dur="6.44">Consolidated power of wealth and the um</text><text start="331.32" dur="6.3">and Democratic ownership and governance</text><text start="333.919" dur="5.62">can continue in a new way yeah</text><text start="337.62" dur="4.139">you know as you&apos;re speaking I I I</text><text start="339.539" dur="3.901">thought a little bit about um you know</text><text start="341.759" dur="4.201">there&apos;s this parable of the blind man</text><text start="343.44" dur="5.759">and the elephant and uh how one blind</text><text start="345.96" dur="5.4">man will feel an elephant&apos;s Tusk and say</text><text start="349.199" dur="6.241">oh this is a pointy sphere and one will</text><text start="351.36" dur="6.48">will grab its leg and say this is a tree</text><text start="355.44" dur="4.02">trunk and in some versions of the</text><text start="357.84" dur="3.18">stories they come to blows because they</text><text start="359.46" dur="5.04">can&apos;t agree about what the whole</text><text start="361.02" dur="4.98">elephant is and and so you know I want</text><text start="364.5" dur="4.259">to use that sort of parable as a</text><text start="366.0" dur="6.72">launching pad and and say that like when</text><text start="368.759" dur="6.121">some people see web3 and crypto they see</text><text start="372.72" dur="4.58">Ponzi schemes that grow and collapse and</text><text start="374.88" dur="5.099">they see monkey jpegs</text><text start="377.3" dur="5.019">and that to me feels like a different</text><text start="379.979" dur="5.16">part of the elephant if it even is the</text><text start="382.319" dur="5.581">same animal as changing how we organize</text><text start="385.139" dur="5.221">together and using co-ops and bringing</text><text start="387.9" dur="4.68">them online and these lofty goals of</text><text start="390.36" dur="4.92">redesigning how we do the economy</text><text start="392.58" dur="4.14">together like are the monkey jpegs and</text><text start="395.28" dur="4.5">what you&apos;re talking about the same</text><text start="396.72" dur="5.039">elephant I I asked myself that all the</text><text start="399.78" dur="4.08">time I mean I see it like when old</text><text start="401.759" dur="4.981">reporter friends like from you know from</text><text start="403.86" dur="4.98">from uh you know that part of my life uh</text><text start="406.74" dur="4.14">you know do a story on on what&apos;s going</text><text start="408.84" dur="4.079">on in crypto and I realize oh you&apos;re</text><text start="410.88" dur="4.02">seeing like a completely different side</text><text start="412.919" dur="4.56">of this elephant than what I happen to</text><text start="414.9" dur="4.26">have been focused on and</text><text start="417.479" dur="4.861">um and you know for instance going to</text><text start="419.16" dur="6.42">the big like consensus conference in in</text><text start="422.34" dur="6.18">um in Austin you know big kind of crypto</text><text start="425.58" dur="6.0">fairy kind of Speculator heavy thing and</text><text start="428.52" dur="5.88">I realized oh I have I&apos;ve been choosing</text><text start="431.58" dur="5.58">the spaces and the people very carefully</text><text start="434.4" dur="4.2">in that mix and and and it&apos;s something I</text><text start="437.16" dur="3.659">want to service I mean I&apos;ve been lucky</text><text start="438.6" dur="4.26">to you know be in Colorado where where</text><text start="440.819" dur="4.261">you are where lots of the the kind of</text><text start="442.86" dur="5.1">energy that you bring into this</text><text start="445.08" dur="6.239">um space is is centered we&apos;re working on</text><text start="447.96" dur="4.799">Co-op Dows in Colorado where where you</text><text start="451.319" dur="4.861">know for instance our conference East</text><text start="452.759" dur="5.88">Denver is incorporated as a Colorado</text><text start="456.18" dur="5.459">Cooperative so we&apos;re really mixing these</text><text start="458.639" dur="4.68">Traditions there but if you look at the</text><text start="461.639" dur="3.9">you know the crypto World much more</text><text start="463.319" dur="4.141">broadly and and especially what gets</text><text start="465.539" dur="5.041">picked up in the news and what the</text><text start="467.46" dur="5.1">public narrative for most people is it&apos;s</text><text start="470.58" dur="5.64">such a different side of it and that was</text><text start="472.56" dur="6.06">one reason for instance that I got uh</text><text start="476.22" dur="4.699">excited you know for years this is kind</text><text start="478.62" dur="5.04">of lurking in the back of my mind about</text><text start="480.919" dur="5.56">assembling the the writings of vitalik</text><text start="483.66" dur="4.5">butter and into a book which is is</text><text start="486.479" dur="5.581">coming out this month called proof of</text><text start="488.16" dur="6.78">stake he&apos;s the founder of ethereum and</text><text start="492.06" dur="4.979">um and and has been a kind of important</text><text start="494.94" dur="3.9">thought leader and and conversation</text><text start="497.039" dur="4.981">partner for many people in this</text><text start="498.84" dur="6.96">community thinking about the kind of</text><text start="502.02" dur="6.959">house not focused on you know price go</text><text start="505.8" dur="6.72">up price go down not focused on how to</text><text start="508.979" dur="5.641">maximize your Returns on random digital</text><text start="512.52" dur="3.6">assets but instead thinking about those</text><text start="514.62" dur="4.2">social questions about how do we</text><text start="516.12" dur="5.039">organize a society not based on the</text><text start="518.82" dur="5.04">threat of violence and coercion</text><text start="521.159" dur="6.061">um and uh and and I want to invite more</text><text start="523.86" dur="5.34">people into that conversation rather</text><text start="527.22" dur="4.679">than the stuff that tends to be in the</text><text start="529.2" dur="5.699">headlines right well yeah I mean I think</text><text start="531.899" dur="5.821">that taking vitalik&apos;s ratings and making</text><text start="534.899" dur="4.741">them into a book is a great way of sort</text><text start="537.72" dur="3.9">of creating that cross cross pollination</text><text start="539.64" dur="3.54">so the book comes out in the next month</text><text start="541.62" dur="3.6">or so and it&apos;s called proof of stake</text><text start="543.18" dur="6.8">where can people get it well they can</text><text start="545.22" dur="8.34">get it on your old website at proof</text><text start="549.98" dur="5.08">ofstake.getcoin.co which is uh you know</text><text start="553.56" dur="3.36">where you can see all the different</text><text start="555.06" dur="3.36">bookstores or whatever you can get it</text><text start="556.92" dur="4.38">order it from your local bookstore</text><text start="558.42" dur="4.859">that&apos;s an option too we also have a kind</text><text start="561.3" dur="4.38">of nft experiment going as well where</text><text start="563.279" dur="3.141">you can get a signed digital copy of the</text><text start="565.68" dur="3.779">book</text><text start="566.42" dur="6.46">on that site now actually you can get it</text><text start="569.459" dur="5.461">with proof of stake with the new</text><text start="572.88" dur="5.06">underlying system that ethereum is</text><text start="574.92" dur="7.979">running on that&apos;s much closer to to</text><text start="577.94" dur="7.78">carbon free and um and uh enables people</text><text start="582.899" dur="4.56">to you know own a piece of this thing</text><text start="585.72" dur="3.78">that is also going to be distributed</text><text start="587.459" dur="4.38">freely so it&apos;s under a Creative Commons</text><text start="589.5" dur="5.04">license yeah one of the things that I</text><text start="591.839" dur="6.18">think is neat about that nft experiment</text><text start="594.54" dur="6.299">is that you know if vitalik were here</text><text start="598.019" dur="5.521">then we could we could get him to sign</text><text start="600.839" dur="4.68">the inside of the book and maybe say</text><text start="603.54" dur="3.9">something you know save something nice</text><text start="605.519" dur="4.081">and have his physical signature there</text><text start="607.44" dur="4.56">with the nft experience is actually</text><text start="609.6" dur="5.64">going to be taking a copy of the PDF</text><text start="612.0" dur="5.339">book and on the inlet using uh the RSA</text><text start="615.24" dur="4.8">public private key of an account that</text><text start="617.339" dur="5.221">vitalik owns and then being able to</text><text start="620.04" dur="4.739">insert that as a digital signature on</text><text start="622.56" dur="4.26">the nft so kind of taking that physical</text><text start="624.779" dur="4.56">signing experience and bringing it</text><text start="626.82" dur="4.5">online and that&apos;s been I think a fairly</text><text start="629.339" dur="3.961">successful experiment in raising money</text><text start="631.32" dur="5.579">for public goods in the web 3 ecosystem</text><text start="633.3" dur="5.28">selling those those nfts which I may</text><text start="636.899" dur="3.361">note I think are non-transferable so</text><text start="638.58" dur="4.74">there&apos;s no speculation or anything</text><text start="640.26" dur="5.94">involved so I hope to see other book</text><text start="643.32" dur="4.519">authors doing experiences like that and</text><text start="646.2" dur="5.699">bringing the book publishing experience</text><text start="647.839" dur="6.281">more into the web 3 native ecosystem</text><text start="651.899" dur="4.62">and anything to add about that yeah and</text><text start="654.12" dur="3.839">it&apos;s also I think important around uh</text><text start="656.519" dur="3.06">you know we&apos;re partnered with an</text><text start="657.959" dur="4.5">independent publisher called seven</text><text start="659.579" dur="4.5">stories press uh that for whom this is a</text><text start="662.459" dur="3.841">very new experience you know this is a</text><text start="664.079" dur="4.801">press that you know has a deep history</text><text start="666.3" dur="5.82">in in you know radical radical</text><text start="668.88" dur="5.1">imagination is is there a tagline and I</text><text start="672.12" dur="4.8">really appreciated the willingness to</text><text start="673.98" dur="5.7">bring you know their history of work</text><text start="676.92" dur="5.76">with great thinkers like Angela Davis</text><text start="679.68" dur="5.46">and Octavia Butler into conversation</text><text start="682.68" dur="5.52">with this also kind of science fictional</text><text start="685.14" dur="6.36">thinking in the best sense that uh you</text><text start="688.2" dur="5.16">know the vitalik&apos;s work represents yeah</text><text start="691.5" dur="3.6">well I mean I think this conversation</text><text start="693.36" dur="4.14">will see Saul back and forth between</text><text start="695.1" dur="4.5">theory and practice and I&apos;d love to push</text><text start="697.5" dur="3.36">us back towards the theory so we&apos;re</text><text start="699.6"

you can make that more of a</text><text start="1095.0" dur="3.0">closed loop then you have more</text><text start="1096.26" dur="4.98">legitimacy and hopefully more long-term</text><text

think is a meme</text><text start="1105.98" dur="5.64">project slash movement that you&apos;ve been</text><text start="1108.08" dur="6.0">involved in to allow Founders to give an</text><text

kind of more</text><text start="1130.22" dur="4.98">conventional startup Founders for uh for</text><text start="1133.22" dur="5.1">a long time was recognizing that there</text><text start="1135.2" dur="5.58">was kind of a gulf a lot of times a</text><text start="1138.32" dur="4.38">Founder might be interested in what in</text><text start="1140.78" dur="4.56">shared ownership in some form

dur="4.5">the um</text><text start="1178.7" dur="4.979">the idea with exit to community was to</text><text start="1181.22" dur="5.699">invite people into a conversation about</text><text

dur="5.099">open Collective that were funded by you</text><text start="1211.46" dur="5.76">know early stage investors but found a</text><text start="1213.799" dur="5.341">way to buy out those

start="1269.36" dur="3.84">was kind of surprised at how much this</text><text start="1271.34" dur="4.079">language kind of got taken up in the</text><text start="1273.2" dur="4.56">crypto

this you know</text><text start="1281.539" dur="3.541">because of these technologies that</text><text start="1283.16" dur="4.68">actually sharing ownership with</text><text start="1285.08"

in</text><text start="1342.559" dur="3.661">creating a get coin and you know I think</text><text start="1344.72" dur="3.72">being able to make sense of the world</text><text start="1346.22" dur="4.92">and to be able to create an impact on</text><text start="1348.44" dur="5.94">the world is a position of of privilege</text><text start="1351.14" dur="5.94">and I&apos;ve been very lucky thus far to uh</text><text start="1354.38" dur="4.02">be sort of in the frontier and one of</text><text start="1357.08" dur="5.16">the things that I really hope that we&apos;re</text><text start="1358.4" dur="6.6">able to do is to backport that uh those</text><text start="1362.24" dur="4.38">lessons to people who are less fortunate</text><text start="1365.0" dur="4.919">and have less privilege so that they can</text><text start="1366.62" dur="5.88">have agency over the world as well and</text><text start="1369.919" dur="4.861">so I think if we&apos;re successful the</text><text start="1372.5" dur="3.659">lessons that we have in the exit to</text><text start="1374.78" dur="3.3">community movement and around share and</text><text start="1376.159" dur="4.741">ownership are going to benefit people</text><text start="1378.08" dur="5.16">who are just less lucky than than guys</text><text start="1380.9" dur="3.54">like like me and you and so</text><text start="1383.24" dur="3.299">um I just wanted to make sure that we</text><text start="1384.44" dur="4.32">that we noted that before we moved on</text><text start="1386.539" dur="6.12">yeah and and I mean one thing I&apos;ve</text><text start="1388.76" dur="6.419">noticed in in this work is like how many</text><text start="1392.659" dur="4.921">people who are who find themselves in</text><text start="1395.179" dur="5.101">positions leading companies</text><text start="1397.58" dur="4.86">um uh or building projects you know</text><text start="1400.28" dur="5.399">creating things that take off how much</text><text start="1402.44" dur="5.82">they would like better options right</text><text start="1405.679" dur="5.341">um how much like the the present exit</text><text start="1408.26" dur="5.279">strategies of IPO or get acquired or</text><text start="1411.02" dur="5.039">whatever it is are often not actually</text><text start="1413.539" dur="3.841">the things that they most want for their</text><text start="1416.059" dur="3.961">projects</text><text start="1417.38" dur="5.159">um and and that they get steered through</text><text start="1420.02" dur="4.44">particular structures and you know</text><text start="1422.539" dur="4.38">watching for instance how how you</text><text start="1424.46" dur="5.099">thought through the question of how to</text><text start="1426.919" dur="5.701">decentralize bitcoin how to how to deal</text><text start="1429.559" dur="5.401">with where it had come and move it</text><text start="1432.62" dur="4.26">toward where it needed to go next and</text><text start="1434.96" dur="3.32">and and how that process has continued</text><text start="1436.88" dur="4.62">viewed</text><text start="1438.28" dur="5.5">as new leaders have come up in in the in</text><text start="1441.5" dur="6.32">the community and in the Dow you know is</text><text start="1443.78" dur="6.42">an example of of that grasping and and</text><text start="1447.82" dur="3.94">you know I a lot of what I&apos;ve been</text><text start="1450.2" dur="3.12">trying to do over the last few years is</text><text start="1451.76" dur="4.2">like just</text><text start="1453.32" dur="4.739">say yes to that urge you know to</text><text start="1455.96" dur="5.219">recognize yeah we need to work together</text><text start="1458.059" dur="6.48">to find better options to find better</text><text start="1461.179" dur="6.061">Pathways better uses of that of that</text><text start="1464.539" dur="4.5">privilege of that opportunity yeah and</text><text start="1467.24" dur="4.14">also I got to convince my investors and</text><text start="1469.039" dur="5.401">my users and all the people who&apos;ve</text><text start="1471.38" dur="4.86">invested in me uh in non-financial ways</text><text start="1474.44" dur="3.06">along the way so</text><text start="1476.24" dur="4.26">um you know there&apos;s this there&apos;s this</text><text start="1477.5" dur="5.419">stigmergic sort of uh path that&apos;s being</text><text start="1480.5" dur="5.159">laid here where if one or two or three</text><text start="1482.919" dur="4.721">founders can prove that Collective</text><text start="1485.659" dur="4.441">ownership or Collective governance is</text><text start="1487.64" dur="5.519">possible than that enables a whole</text><text start="1490.1" dur="4.68">tranche of other entrepreneurs uh cohort</text><text start="1493.159" dur="3.781">of other entrepreneurs to go to their</text><text start="1494.78" dur="4.259">investors and say this is possible which</text><text start="1496.94" dur="4.02">hopefully creates 30 or 50 which can</text><text start="1499.039" dur="3.901">then just fractal outwards and so I</text><text start="1500.96" dur="4.079">think that that&apos;s what social movements</text><text start="1502.94" dur="4.26">are it&apos;s proving that it&apos;s possible and</text><text start="1505.039" dur="4.801">moving out of the system that just moves</text><text start="1507.2" dur="4.92">us from seed to series a to series C to</text><text start="1509.84" dur="5.64">selling to

start="1517.34" dur="4.14">of the world and it&apos;s really exciting</text><text start="1518.78" dur="5.22">and it&apos;s something that for me a purpose</text><text start="1521.48" dur="6.059">that history has served for me right in</text><text start="1524.0" dur="5.64">recognizing that we that this stuff is</text><text start="1527.539" dur="5.041">possible you know for instance when I</text><text start="1529.64" dur="4.86">get discouraged I think of the 130</text><text start="1532.58" dur="3.78">billion dollar Cooperative Bank down the</text><text start="1534.5" dur="4.86">road from us in Denver</text><text start="1536.36" dur="5.4">um that was built up from generations of</text><text start="1539.36" dur="4.1">struggle by Farm Workers across the</text><text start="1541.76" dur="3.72">United States</text><text start="1543.46" dur="4.12">insisting on the need for</text><text start="1545.48" dur="4.199">farmer-controlled financing through</text><text start="1547.58" dur="5.099">their cooperatives uh you know I think</text><text start="1549.679" dur="5.161">of my grandfather who ran a Cooperative</text><text start="1552.679" dur="4.141">business at the end of his

dur="6.54">as the that industry got Consolidated</text><text start="1561.5" dur="5.6">through you know banding together all</text><text start="1565.52" dur="4.74">these kinds of examples</text><text start="1567.1" dur="6.76">seeing this Legacy at work beginning to</text><text start="1570.26" dur="6.12">notice it around us like even things</text><text start="1573.86" dur="4.74">like the Cooperative lurking in the</text><text start="1576.38" dur="5.58">supply chain for Dairy Queen you know</text><text start="1578.6" dur="7.5">like these things are everywhere and uh</text><text start="1581.96" dur="6.78">and uh the more you see that the more</text><text start="1586.1" dur="4.76">you feel that sense that oh this is</text><text start="1588.74" dur="5.4">possible of course we do need to</text><text start="1590.86" dur="5.86">ReDiscover how to do it in the context</text><text start="1594.14" dur="5.34">of this supercharged Tech economy fueled</text><text start="1596.72" dur="5.579">by Venture Capital which by the way too</text><text start="1599.48" dur="5.52">is not a natural feature of the of the</text><text start="1602.299" dur="5.401">universe you know Venture Capital exists</text><text start="1605.0" dur="5.039">as a flow in our economy because the</text><text start="1607.7" dur="4.26">federal government began to permit it</text><text start="1610.039" dur="4.38">particularly with a change too it&apos;s</text><text start="1611.96" dur="4.8">called The Prudent man rule in 1979 you</text><text start="1614.419" dur="4.921">know it was a decision to permit that</text><text start="1616.76" dur="6.24">kind of financing and not other kinds of</text><text start="1619.34" dur="6.54">financing at that scale so um you know</text><text start="1623.0" dur="5.82">so when when you that history I think</text><text start="1625.88" dur="5.039">enables us to recognize ah we could have</text><text start="1628.82" dur="4.32">done things differently before</text><text start="1630.919" dur="4.281">and we have choices before us now</text><text start="1633.14" dur="5.82">technology is not inevitability</text><text start="1635.2" dur="5.44">technology is a site of struggle and you</text><text start="1638.96" dur="3.42">know to be honest I&apos;m very worried about</text><text start="1640.64" dur="4.2">how that struggle is going right now</text><text start="1642.38" dur="4.86">yeah can you say more about what worries</text><text start="1644.84" dur="5.219">you and what signs you would like to see</text><text start="1647.24" dur="6.38">yeah totally so</text><text start="1650.059" dur="8.821">to me the biggest worry is that again</text><text start="1653.62" dur="7.78">the the kind of to use a yeah uh sat</text><text start="1658.88" dur="5.279">where the subjectivity of the of the</text><text start="1661.4" dur="3.92">investor is still being treated as the</text><text start="1664.159" dur="5.221">primary</text><text start="1665.32" dur="6.4">focus of of both the culture and the</text><text start="1669.38" dur="4.56">regulation of this new technology that</text><text start="1671.72" dur="4.439">that who are Regulators worried about</text><text start="1673.94" dur="4.5">they&apos;re worried about you know investors</text><text start="1676.159" dur="5.161">getting in trouble people who are just</text><text start="1678.44" dur="6.479">putting up Capital when there is an</text><text start="1681.32" dur="6.18">opportunity actually to see a chance for</text><text start="1684.919"

dur="5.039">you know we&apos;re mapping this assumption</text><text start="1698.96" dur="5.219">that investors should control the</text><text start="1701.179" dur="5.041">economy into the draft rulemaking</text><text start="1704.179" dur="3.961">instead I think what we could be</text><text start="1706.22" dur="4.02">thinking about is how can we recognize</text><text start="1708.14" dur="5.399">hey this is an opportunity to really</text><text start="1710.24" dur="5.4">widen uh the opportunities for</text><text start="1713.539" dur="5.401">participation in ownership and</text><text start="1715.64" dur="5.7">governance of Enterprise this should be</text><text start="1718.94" dur="4.56">a chance for us to say hey let&apos;s make</text><text start="1721.34" dur="5.339">sure that we have a framework so that</text><text start="1723.5" dur="5.4">users really can participate in owning</text><text start="1726.679" dur="5.161">the things that they contribute to to</text><text start="1728.9" dur="5.1">creating value for how can we make sure</text><text start="1731.84" dur="4.74">to do that safely how can we make sure</text><text start="1734.0" dur="6.0">that the the incredibly creative</text><text start="1736.58" dur="6.0">possibilities for governance in these um</text><text start="1740.0" dur="5.82">in these spaces is something that we</text><text start="1742.58" dur="5.219">protect we encourage that creativity we</text><text start="1745.82" dur="4.26">encourage people to program new kinds of</text><text start="1747.799" dur="6.721">voting systems new kinds of Delegation</text><text start="1750.08" dur="7.02">systems uh uh uh even old kinds of of</text><text start="1754.52" dur="4.92">systems into these new into these new</text><text start="1757.1" dur="4.5">tools you know one thing I&apos;m really</text><text start="1759.44" dur="4.8">excited about is the return of juries</text><text start="1761.6" dur="5.819">which were the form of democracy the</text><text start="1764.24" dur="5.78">most uh prominent form of democracy in</text><text start="1767.419" dur="5.701">ancient Athens they&apos;re starting to recur</text><text start="1770.02" dur="5.639">uh in crypto land you know I want to</text><text start="1773.12" dur="4.919">make sure that that space of of</text><text start="1775.659" dur="4.541">democratic creativity and shared</text><text start="1778.039" dur="5.041">ownership is what we&apos;re concerned to</text><text start="1780.2" dur="4.68">protect not just the the people who</text><text start="1783.08" dur="4.8">happen to have the capacity to be</text><text start="1784.88" dur="5.1">investors right</text><text start="1787.88" dur="3.96">um you know I think that the two words</text><text start="1789.98" dur="3.54">that sort of came to mind as you&apos;re</text><text start="1791.84" dur="4.14">speaking there is the difference between</text><text start="1793.52" dur="4.2">a consumer who just passively consumes</text><text start="1795.98" dur="6.24">goods and services in a citizen which</text><text start="1797.72" dur="6.839">actually has a say in the governance of</text><text start="1802.22" dur="5.04">hopefully their local community their</text><text start="1804.559" dur="5.34">nation and and the various systems that</text><text start="1807.26" dur="6.72">that they&apos;re a part of and I guess what</text><text start="1809.899" dur="6.061">would have to be true to move thousands</text><text start="1813.98" dur="4.079">or millions of people from consumers to</text><text start="1815.96" dur="5.52">Citizens what does high resolution</text><text start="1818.059" dur="6.48">democracy in the web age even even look</text><text start="1821.48" dur="4.22">like because I think that for for many</text><text start="1824.539" dur="4.38">people</text><text start="1825.7" dur="4.719">democracy and voting and citizenry kind</text><text start="1828.919" dur="4.921">of feels like showing up to vote every</text><text start="1830.419" dur="6.541">two maybe four years you know uh and so</text><text start="1833.84" dur="5.28">so how how do we make that leap well to</text><text start="1836.96" dur="4.199">to have to be able to imagine a citizen</text><text start="1839.12" dur="4.32">I think you need a jurisdiction you know</text><text start="1841.159" dur="5.64">you need a space and that&apos;s something</text><text start="1843.44" dur="6.3">that that web3 tools actually open up</text><text start="1846.799" dur="4.74">and important way to give you an example</text><text start="1849.74" dur="4.52">in the early 90s there was a famous</text><text start="1851.539" dur="4.921">article in the Village Voice</text><text start="1854.26" dur="4.18">called it was called a rape in</text><text start="1856.46" dur="4.8">cyberspace it was about an early online</text><text start="1858.44" dur="5.459">community dealing with a case of virtual</text><text start="1861.26" dur="4.519">sexual assault and it was a fascinating</text><text start="1863.899" dur="4.081">Story the space was called lambdamu</text><text start="1865.779" dur="4.541">because there was this really</text><text start="1867.98" dur="4.74">problematic character in it the</text><text start="1870.32" dur="4.739">community starts figuring out ways to</text><text start="1872.72" dur="4.62">deal with this problem and they end up</text><text start="1875.059" dur="4.681">like building a framework for</text><text start="1877.34" dur="5.28">self-governing their community Through</text><text start="1879.74" dur="4.62">Democratic processes but then actually</text><text start="1882.62" dur="3.779">the people running the servers were</text><text start="1884.36" dur="5.039">sitting at you know the zero Xerox park</text><text start="1886.399" dur="5.041">facility you know owned by a corporation</text><text start="1889.399" dur="4.621">and realized you know what</text><text start="1891.44" dur="5.16">everything that happens is actually our</text><text start="1894.02" dur="5.159">legal liability and so we actually can&apos;t</text><text start="1896.6" dur="4.799">let you control this democratically and</text><text start="1899.179" dur="3.72">that kind of pattern is played out in</text><text start="1901.399" dur="4.921">all of our corporate governance</text><text start="1902.899" dur="6.301">server-based online spaces and one thing</text><text start="1906.32" dur="5.88">that crypto does kind of open up is is</text><text start="1909.2" dur="6.42">rather than being centrally controlled</text><text start="1912.2" dur="6.479">by default you know it doesn&apos;t just by</text><text start="1915.62" dur="6.12">default the the default of a blockchain</text><text start="1918.679" dur="5.22">is is distributed ownership is</text><text start="1921.74" dur="5.22">participant ownership and so it does</text><text start="1923.899" dur="5.64">open this this possibility of having</text><text start="1926.96" dur="5.16">jurisdictions that are not ultimately</text><text start="1929.539" dur="4.681">reducible to a particular you know</text><text start="1932.12" dur="4.919">corporate entity or geographic location</text><text start="1934.22" dur="6.12">and so that creates opportunity for us</text><text start="1937.039" dur="6.661">to think about democracy not just in our</text><text start="1940.34" dur="6.6">territorial jurisdictions those are</text><text start="1943.7" dur="4.62">important too territory land stewardship</text><text start="1946.94" dur="4.02">of land is never going to not be</text><text start="1948.32" dur="4.859">important but our virtual spaces are</text><text start="1950.96" dur="6.48">important too you and increasingly so</text><text start="1953.179" dur="6.901">and so I I think this this uh this opens</text><text start="1957.44" dur="4.979">a door for us to start practicing</text><text start="1960.08" dur="4.319">democracy in those kinds of</text><text start="1962.419" dur="5.041">jurisdictions in the ways appropriate to</text><text start="1964.399" dur="6.421">them that this is a kind of 1776 moment</text><text start="1967.46" dur="5.76">uh a chance to write the the social</text><text start="1970.82" dur="6.079">contracts together</text><text start="1973.22" dur="6.36">um uh uh in a way that that you know</text><text start="1976.899" dur="4.66">begins the process of building democracy</text><text start="1979.58" dur="3.959">there and and to do that we need to</text><text start="1981.559" dur="5.821">recognize the need to have a much</text><text start="1983.539" dur="6.721">broader uh uh conversation than for</text><text start="1987.38" dur="6.179">instance happen in 70 1776 where</text><text start="1990.26" dur="5.58">democracy excluded uh enslaved people</text><text start="1993.559"

dur="3.98">it&apos;s a place to build it&apos;s a place where</text><text start="2275.619" dur="3.72">we can build new infrastructures</text><text start="2277.44" dur="3.46">hyperstructures is a meme that&apos;s been</text><text start="2279.339" dur="3.24">been thrown around the web three space</text><text start="2280.9" dur="3.78">basically like an institution in The</text><text start="2282.579"

a</text><text start="2297.82" dur="3.84">public space and you can&apos;t have hardness</text><text start="2300.52" dur="3.66">and you can&apos;t have new institutions</text><text start="2301.66" dur="4.32">without building and I contrast that</text><text start="2304.18" dur="4.02">with the wider movement towards social</text><text start="2305.98" dur="4.56">media over the last 10 or 15 years</text><text start="2308.2" dur="3.78">basically kind of since occupy since we</text><text start="2310.54" dur="3.84">realized that the old institutions</text><text start="2311.98"

start="2344.079" dur="3.481">for for you to put it in the pot and</text><text start="2345.579" dur="4.26">stir it maybe yeah there&apos;s so you know</text><text start="2347.56" dur="4.22">we focus so much on what social media</text><text start="2349.839" dur="5.581">has enabled</text><text start="2351.78" dur="4.96">that we forget what it both the good and</text><text start="2355.42"

dur="3.18">recognition that was one of the things</text><text start="2418.839" dur="4.74">that made me really interested in</text><text start="2420.64" dur="7.26">ethereum hey this is a form of

and like you know someone like me who</text><text start="2895.0" dur="3.3">didn&apos;t have any student debt and has a</text><text start="2896.44" dur="6.78">computer science degree and like learned</text><text start="2898.3" dur="6.9">to play the VC game when I was 22. uh I</text><text start="2903.22" dur="5.22">think has like gotten to wiggle room to</text><text start="2905.2"

larger and or</text><text start="2913.24" dur="3.06">someone in this space there&apos;s a Venn</text><text start="2914.92" dur="3.06">diagram of like what&apos;s going to put food</text><text

at the intersection</text><text start="2922.54" dur="6.299">of that is the sliver of of of uh</text><text start="2925.66" dur="5.34">modules that that I&apos;m looking to deploy</text><text

dur="7.32">to me for me is like is citizen really</text><text start="2937.68" dur="7.3">compatible with wealth inequality</text><text start="2940.96" dur="6.48">um in a world where one percent of the</text><text start="2944.98" dur="4.68">population has somewhat like 50 of of</text><text start="2947.44" dur="5.639">all the wealth and you know for the</text><text start="2949.66" dur="4.98">median citizen uh uh that is just trying</text><text start="2953.079" dur="2.881">to put food on the table for their kids</text><text start="2954.64" dur="3.24">or get them through college or get</text><text start="2955.96" dur="4.08">through another day you don&apos;t have the</text><text start="2957.88" dur="4.38">long-termism to actually systemically</text><text start="2960.04" dur="5.1">change the forces of Oppression that</text><text start="2962.26" dur="4.559">have their boot on your neck and so</text><text start="2965.14" dur="4.14">um you know like what would you say to</text><text start="2966.819" dur="4.141">someone who wants to see these systems</text><text start="2969.28" dur="3.48">built but is just trying to put food on</text><text start="2970.96" dur="3.78">the table and like maybe they have to</text><text start="2972.76" dur="3.78">prioritize in their day working 12-hour</text><text start="2974.74" dur="3.839">shifts instead of voting instead of</text><text start="2976.54" dur="4.38">being involved in citizenry you know</text><text start="2978.579" dur="4.861">what would you say to someone like that</text><text start="2980.92" dur="5.1">well it it&apos;s not a question of what I</text><text start="2983.44" dur="4.919">say I mean for instance my lab right now</text><text start="2986.02" dur="4.26">is doing a project called sacred Stacks</text><text start="2988.359" dur="5.881">where we&apos;re working with and learning</text><text start="2990.28" dur="5.46">from a a group of of Grassroots</text><text start="2994.24" dur="4.44">communities that are exploring these</text><text start="2995.74" dur="4.98">Technologies and it is really you see</text><text start="2998.68" dur="4.26">that that question of privilege and</text><text start="3000.72" dur="3.72">possibility very clearly there you know</text><text start="3002.94" dur="3.54">people are putting out fires all day</text><text start="3004.44" dur="4.56">they do not have time to fuss around on</text><text start="3006.48" dur="4.98">metamask right and and we that&apos;s</text><text start="3009.0" dur="5.06">something that we&apos;re experiencing in</text><text start="3011.46" dur="4.98">these conversations very very directly</text><text start="3014.06" dur="6.22">at the same time I think it comes into</text><text start="3016.44" dur="5.639">questions of design for those who are</text><text start="3020.28" dur="4.68">you know who do find themselves in the</text><text start="3022.079" dur="6.181">positions of of building these tools</text><text start="3024.96" dur="6.72">right now what are you prioritizing what</text><text start="3028.26" dur="5.16">rights are you encoding into into these</text><text start="3031.68" dur="4.08">tools for instance if you look down the</text><text start="3033.42" dur="4.26">you know the list of the the UN</text><text start="3035.76" dur="3.9">Declaration of Human Rights well you</text><text start="3037.68" dur="4.679">know blockchains are building in a sense</text><text start="3039.66" dur="5.3">of in some cases is privacy that&apos;s</text><text start="3042.359" dur="5.46">that&apos;s a right on the UN declaration</text><text start="3044.96" dur="4.96">they&apos;re building in property rights are</text><text start="3047.819" dur="5.961">very very strong you know you get your</text><text start="3049.92" dur="6.72">thing it&apos;s yours but for instance are we</text><text start="3053.78" dur="6.16">encoding economic Justice you know</text><text start="3056.64" dur="5.64">making sure that uh you know that we&apos;re</text><text start="3059.94" dur="4.919">counteracting the power of the wealthy</text><text start="3062.28" dur="3.72">over the power of of the less wealthy</text><text start="3064.859" dur="3.301">you know</text><text start="3066.0" dur="4.079">we could also be programming those into</text><text start="3068.16" dur="4.02">blockchains you know what about the</text><text start="3070.079" dur="4.801">rights of Earth are we programming in</text><text start="3072.18" dur="6.419">you know we could be writing protocols</text><text start="3074.88" dur="6.179">that that uh do not permit carbon</text><text start="3078.599" dur="4.321">emissions to be fueling the um the</text><text start="3081.059" dur="3.721">confirmation of transactions you know</text><text start="3082.92" dur="4.32">you could have people who are able to</text><text start="3084.78" dur="4.38">confirm that oh I found that this minor</text><text start="3087.24" dur="3.96">is being fueled by carbon emissions and</text><text start="3089.16" dur="4.26">then the protocol just takes them off</text><text start="3091.2" dur="5.04">the system uh you know we could be</text><text start="3093.42" dur="4.62">building Technologies with those kinds</text><text start="3096.24" dur="4.379">of values in mind</text><text start="3098.04" dur="5.039">um and you know so far that has not been</text><text start="3100.619" dur="5.881">the priority so I think there there is</text><text start="3103.079" dur="5.701">uh we have to recognize that these these</text><text start="3106.5" dur="5.16">Technologies are actually encoding</text><text start="3108.78" dur="6.0">values already they&apos;re encoding you know</text><text start="3111.66" dur="4.56">economic hierarchies already</text><text start="3114.78" dur="3.299">um and that we could be doing these</text><text start="3116.22" dur="3.54">differently and and and those</text><text start="3118.079" dur="3.721">conversations I think our our</text><text start="3119.76" dur="4.38">conversations that we all need to be</text><text start="3121.8" dur="5.7">having and then we need to invite not</text><text start="3124.14" dur="4.86">just those who you know who who are have</text><text start="3127.5" dur="2.76">access to the kind of privileges you&apos;re</text><text start="3129.0" dur="2.88">talking about</text><text start="3130.26" dur="3.66">um but that it&apos;s a much wider public</text><text start="3131.88" dur="4.199">conversation about what kinds of</text><text start="3133.92" dur="4.02">protocols do we really want and do we</text><text start="3136.079" dur="4.98">really need yeah</text><text start="3137.94" dur="5.22">yeah I mean I know for me uh</text><text start="3141.059" dur="3.421">It&apos;s always important as an entrepreneur</text><text start="3143.16" dur="2.88">not to try to swallow the whole elephant</text><text start="3144.48" dur="3.359">at once and I view this whole thing as</text><text start="3146.04" dur="3.66">an iterative evolutionary game in which</text><text start="3147.839" dur="4.801">we&apos;re going between boom and bust fear</text><text start="3149.7" dur="5.82">and greed every three to four years and</text><text start="3152.64" dur="4.8">um every Capital rotation I I would love</text><text start="3155.52" dur="3.24">to see more talent and capital rotate</text><text start="3157.44" dur="3.899">towards things that are good for the</text><text start="3158.76" dur="4.92">world and good for the median citizenry</text><text start="3161.339" dur="4.681">of humanity in a way from like monkey</text><text start="3163.68" dur="4.98">jpegs and Ponzi schemes like if we can</text><text start="3166.02" dur="4.62">just turn the capital rotation scheme</text><text start="3168.66" dur="4.62">every boom bust cycle a little bit</text><text start="3170.64" dur="5.219">towards that I think eventually we can</text><text start="3173.28" dur="3.98">reach that median citizen let&apos;s call it</text><text start="3175.859" dur="4.881">in 10 years</text><text start="3177.26" dur="5.859">2032. what did jpegs have their place</text><text start="3180.74" dur="4.66">that&apos;s true I mean there is value and</text><text start="3183.119" dur="4.44">uselessness yeah</text><text start="3185.4" dur="4.439">um yeah I I mean I think that they do</text><text start="3187.559" dur="4.381">but uh you know in terms of the economic</text><text start="3189.839" dur="3.661">system that that I want to design there</text><text start="3191.94" dur="3.179">there may be seventh on the priority</text><text start="3193.5" dur="2.16">list</text><text start="3195.119"

dur="5.039">first one is one big criticism of dials</text><text start="3231.24" dur="4.8">is that they are trying to unnecessarily</text><text start="3233.579" dur="4.621">reinvent hundreds of years

dur="5.7">more effective and efficient than dogs</text><text start="3242.76" dur="6.0">can be uh what is your answer to that</text><text start="3245.88" dur="5.16">and my second question is what are some</text><text start="3248.76" dur="3.96">like real world examples of like</text><text start="3251.04" dur="3.539">governance short-term governance</text><text start="3252.72" dur="4.68">experiments

take</text><text start="3272.28" dur="4.16">a swing at that</text><text start="3273.78" dur="6.539">um I do think that in many places Dallas</text><text start="3276.44" dur="6.399">are Dows are a

dur="3.9">good</text><text start="3478.319" dur="4.861">another piece of it though too is where</text><text start="3481.2" dur="4.619">that I&apos;m interested in is where does</text><text

start="3527.76" dur="3.539">um I think maybe my question can be</text><text start="3529.74" dur="4.14">summarized and like</text><text start="3531.299" dur="6.841">three or four bullet points governance</text><text start="3533.88" dur="6.419">is hard and non-trivial governance is</text><text start="3538.14" dur="4.679">something that we definitely are</text><text start="3540.299" dur="4.081">severely out of practice with like our</text><text start="3542.819" dur="3.48">self-governance and participation into</text><text start="3544.38" dur="4.199">the process is something that we&apos;re out</text><text start="3546.299" dur="5.04">of practice with and therefore how can</text><text start="3548.579" dur="5.04">we kind of rebuild that knowledge of how</text><text start="3551.339" dur="4.74">to self-govern and what lessons can we</text><text start="3553.619" dur="5.341">take from traditional forms or like</text><text start="3556.079" dur="4.921">weather co-ops or</text><text start="3558.96" dur="3.06">um like neighborhood associations or</text><text start="3561.0" dur="3.9">otherwise</text><text start="3562.02" dur="5.88">I I love that so much because I you know</text><text start="3564.9" dur="5.64">that word experience has been in my mind</text><text start="3567.9" dur="5.459">a lot lately partly recognizing my own</text><text start="3570.54" dur="4.62">like why am I obsessed with this stuff I</text><text start="3573.359" dur="4.081">I&apos;ve been realizing more and more how</text><text start="3575.16" dur="5.699">much has to do with like when I was a</text><text start="3577.44" dur="5.22">teenager I had particular experiences of</text><text start="3580.859" dur="5.101">like Democratic governance working</text><text start="3582.66" dur="6.959">functionally in at my school like in my</text><text start="3585.96" dur="5.52">in very small spaces that gave me I</text><text start="3589.619" dur="4.561">think an outside sense of like yeah we</text><text start="3591.48" dur="5.46">can do this it&apos;s okay</text><text start="3594.18" dur="4.919">um but that sense of skills is I think</text><text start="3596.94" dur="4.08">really important it&apos;s something for</text><text start="3599.099" dur="3.301">instance you know one of the one of the</text><text start="3601.02" dur="3.24">people I&apos;ve been learning from in the</text><text start="3602.4" dur="3.899">transformative Justice movement um</text><text start="3604.26" dur="4.2">Adrian Marie Brown really centers is</text><text start="3606.299" dur="5.76">like we have lost our skills of</text><text start="3608.46" dur="5.879">democratic practice and so you know one</text><text start="3612.059" dur="3.481">thing I&apos;m really excited about in the</text><text start="3614.339" dur="3.96">work that we&apos;re doing in the meta</text><text start="3615.54" dur="5.22">governance project is like is how do we</text><text start="3618.299" dur="5.28">see those skills how do we create spaces</text><text start="3620.76" dur="5.28">and experiences that help people develop</text><text start="3623.579" dur="4.561">a sense of confidence again around our</text><text start="3626.04" dur="4.14">capacity to self-govern and I think that</text><text start="3628.14" dur="4.56">actually a lot of the decline of</text><text start="3630.18" dur="4.139">democracy around the world might have</text><text start="3632.7" dur="4.44">something to do with the fact that like</text><text start="3634.319" dur="4.861">in our daily online lives as so many of</text><text start="3637.14" dur="4.62">us are involved in like we&apos;re just</text><text start="3639.18" dur="4.439">forgetting that we could do this that</text><text start="3641.76" dur="6.599">yes governance is hard but it&apos;s not that</text><text start="3643.619" dur="5.821">hard you know and like a bunch of you</text><text start="3648.359" dur="3.661">know people are like how could you have</text><text start="3649.44" dur="5.1">a company that&apos;s owned by by zillions of</text><text start="3652.02" dur="4.14">workers or or users it&apos;s like we have</text><text start="3654.54" dur="3.36">companies owned by zillions of investors</text><text start="3656.16" dur="5.159">and that works out you know for them</text><text start="3657.9" dur="5.699">okay you know so is I think that</text><text start="3661.319" dur="6.0">question of skills is just so dead on</text><text start="3663.599" dur="6.121">and I think of it as as just like so</text><text start="3667.319" dur="4.201">front and center for the kinds of things</text><text start="3669.72" dur="4.02">that you know that we need to be</text><text start="3671.52" dur="3.839">building so thank you</text><text start="3673.74" dur="3.059">yeah I would I would just add really</text><text start="3675.359" dur="3.48">quick that like until we get to the</text><text start="3676.799" dur="2.881">place where we&apos;ve built the skills uh</text><text start="3678.839" dur="2.401">one of the things that I&apos;ve been</text><text start="3679.68" dur="3.06">thinking about is building governance</text><text start="3681.24" dur="3.42">systems that don&apos;t feel like governance</text><text start="3682.74" dur="3.18">so on get coin grants every quarter</text><text start="3684.66" dur="3.179">there&apos;s three million dollars worth of</text><text start="3685.92" dur="3.54">matching that&apos;s available for you to</text><text start="3687.839" dur="3.78">fund the public goods that you rely on</text><text start="3689.46" dur="4.68">open source software climate change</text><text start="3691.619" dur="5.281">diversity equity and inclusion and when</text><text start="3694.14" dur="4.38">you contribute a dollar your funds are</text><text start="3696.9" dur="3.06">basically it feels like you&apos;re funding</text><text start="3698.52" dur="3.299">something like an e-commerce experience</text><text start="3699.96" dur="3.54">but if you turn it on its side and you</text><text start="3701.819" dur="3.78">look at it it&apos;s actually governing where</text><text start="3703.5" dur="3.78">the matching pools are going to so you</text><text start="3705.599" dur="3.301">create like a cart checkout experience</text><text start="3707.28" dur="3.839">that feels like an e-commerce experience</text><text start="3708.9" dur="3.959">but it&apos;s actually governing like tricky</text><text start="3711.119" dur="3.96">you just govern something</text><text start="3712.859" dur="3.541">um and we&apos;ve got 700 000 data points of</text><text start="3715.079" dur="3.48">what the ethereum community cares about</text><text start="3716.4" dur="4.02">every every quarter which is just some</text><text start="3718.559" dur="4.621">higher resolution democracy web scale</text><text start="3720.42" dur="4.08">democracy so but but what I want to I</text><text start="3723.18" dur="3.54">think we should be building those skills</text><text start="3724.5" dur="3.839">uh in the meantime</text><text start="3726.72" dur="5.42">I think we have time for maybe one more</text><text start="3728.339" dur="3.801">question did I see a hand up over here</text><text start="3737.04" dur="3.66">I just wanted to come back to the piece</text><text start="3739.079" dur="3.121">of privilege that you&apos;re discussing</text><text start="3740.7" dur="4.8">earlier because something that I&apos;ve</text><text start="3742.2" dur="5.639">experienced is when there&apos;s not a clear</text><text start="3745.5" dur="4.92">pathway to you know like a business</text><text start="3747.839" dur="4.98">model or like a pathway for labor</text><text start="3750.42" dur="6.78">compensation in like an emergent space</text><text start="3752.819" dur="7.201">how do you ensure that the people who</text><text start="3757.2" dur="7.139">are building in that emergence even have</text><text start="3760.02" dur="5.819">the capacity to join or to participate</text><text start="3764.339" dur="4.341">um and I&apos;m interested in your</text><text start="3765.839" dur="2.841">perspective on the</text><text start="3768.839" dur="4.5">I promise we wouldn&apos;t say what we were</text><text start="3770.76" dur="4.92">talking about refer back to earlier</text><text start="3773.339" dur="5.101">conversations but it&apos;s something that we</text><text start="3775.68" dur="6.3">were just discussing was was what uh</text><text start="3778.44" dur="6.119">what should compensation and look like</text><text start="3781.98" dur="5.099">in these Global Dows what does what does</text><text start="3784.559" dur="5.941">pay equity and pay Justice look like</text><text start="3787.079" dur="5.401">when we really do have the capacity to</text><text start="3790.5" dur="3.599">involve people from around the world who</text><text start="3792.48" dur="4.02">are living in very different economic</text><text start="3794.099" dur="5.041">contexts or in one place that are living</text><text start="3796.5" dur="4.319">in very different economic contexts</text><text start="3799.14" dur="4.26">you know again I think that is a</text><text start="3800.819" dur="4.381">question that we just must not</text><text start="3803.4" dur="4.32">um allide you know it&apos;s a question that</text><text start="3805.2" dur="4.5">that is another opportunity for us to go</text><text start="3807.72" dur="6.66">deep and it&apos;s a reminder of the things</text><text start="3809.7" dur="6.72">that the existing Frameworks of the of</text><text start="3814.38" dur="4.32">the economy today kind of sometimes let</text><text start="3816.42" dur="5.04">us ignore you know they let us say okay</text><text start="3818.7" dur="5.7">we&apos;re a U.S corporation therefore we&apos;re</text><text start="3821.46" dur="5.76">going to follow this set of rules but if</text><text start="3824.4" dur="5.699">we&apos;re not under such a jurisdiction it</text><text start="3827.22" dur="4.92">invites us to ask those questions in in</text><text start="3830.099" dur="5.841">radical new ways</text><text start="3832.14" dur="6.659">um you know I I think part of the the</text><text start="3835.94" dur="5.679">critical appeal of something like Global</text><text start="3838.799" dur="6.441">jurisdictions is global Justice you know</text><text start="3841.619" dur="6.841">is is is redistribution is is is</text><text start="3845.24" dur="6.04">equalizing the capacity of people in</text><text start="3848.46" dur="6.599">many different kinds of contexts to uh</text><text start="3851.28" dur="7.92">to access you know the uh just rewards</text><text start="3855.059" dur="6.24">for what they contribute and again to me</text><text start="3859.2" dur="4.2">just this is this is a vital</text><text start="3861.299" dur="4.201">conversation something that you know</text><text start="3863.4" dur="3.719">that that we must not put off</text><text start="3865.5" dur="4.5">um when we to the extent that we put it</text><text start="3867.119" dur="4.98">off is the extent to which we ride on</text><text start="3870.0" dur="4.619">the privilege that you know that some of</text><text start="3872.099" dur="4.141">us might have uh While others are left</text><text start="3874.619" dur="2.641">out of the conversation</text><text start="3876.24" dur="1.74">yeah</text><text start="3877.26" dur="3.539">um</text><text start="3877.98" dur="5.4">a hard hard question to answer with only</text><text start="3880.799" dur="4.681">a few seconds left but um I just want to</text><text start="3883.38" dur="4.14">say directly that uh I think this is</text><text start="3885.48" dur="3.839">under explored space I don&apos;t think that</text><text start="3887.52" dur="4.079">the Legacy system explores it all that</text><text start="3889.319" dur="4.141">well my view is that we have to have uh</text><text start="3891.599" dur="4.441">funding for things that are public goods</text><text start="3893.46" dur="4.2">and for Community oriented I love that</text><text start="3896.04" dur="2.88">in quadratic funding you&apos;re funded based</text><text start="3897.66" dur="2.76">off of whether your peers believe what</text><text start="3898.92" dur="3.48">you&apos;re doing is important not whether</text><text start="3900.42" dur="3.78">you&apos;re going to have it
