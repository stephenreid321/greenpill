today we</text><text start="8.58" dur="6.36">have stani from Ave and lens protocol</text><text start="11.7" dur="6.12">talking about web3 social so basically</text><text start="14.94" dur="5.16">Sunny is the founder of lens protocol</text><text start="17.82" dur="3.959">which is a composable and decentralized</text><text start="20.1" dur="3.9">social graph it lets creators take their</text><text start="21.779" dur="3.961">content with them wherever they want to</text><text start="24.0" dur="4.8">go in the digital Garden of the</text><text start="25.74" dur="4.859">decentralized internet lens is a</text><text start="28.8" dur="3.9">protocol that allows you to have a</text><text start="30.599" dur="4.321">permissionless non-custodial social</text><text start="32.7" dur="3.78">media profile and with lens protocol the</text><text start="34.92" dur="3.18">idea is that you&apos;re in control you own</text><text start="36.48" dur="4.32">your profile where you use it how you</text><text start="38.1" dur="4.02">use it even how you monetize it so um</text><text start="40.8" dur="3.24">that means you have the power over your</text><text start="42.12" dur="4.92">content it&apos;s all right there as an nft</text><text start="44.04" dur="6.24">in your wallet and this is kind of a</text><text start="47.04" dur="5.519">reaction to web 2 and the idea is the</text><text start="50.28" dur="4.68">digital identity and your content should</text><text start="52.559" dur="4.68">be yours not Facebook&apos;s not twitters not</text><text start="54.96" dur="3.54">my spaces</text><text start="57.239" dur="2.881">um what would be true if you owned your</text><text start="58.5" dur="3.96">own content owned your own social graph</text><text start="60.12" dur="4.259">owned your own data the idea behind this</text><text start="62.46" dur="3.78">episode and the really I think</text><text start="64.379" dur="5.1">interesting and beautiful conversation</text><text start="66.24" dur="5.34">with with stani is the big implications</text><text start="69.479" dur="6.0">of this is that it allows us to</text><text start="71.58" dur="5.64">bootstrap identity in web 3 uh allows us</text><text start="75.479" dur="3.361">to create Financial assets out of our</text><text start="77.22" dur="4.02">posts and things that we&apos;re primarily</text><text start="78.84" dur="4.139">thought of as social in the web 2 boom</text><text start="81.24" dur="3.6">it&apos;s easier to build applications the</text><text start="82.979" dur="3.96">network effect of Facebook is not</text><text start="84.84" dur="4.319">massive everyone uses Facebook because</text><text start="86.939" dur="4.201">everyone else uses Facebook and it&apos;s</text><text start="89.159" dur="3.301">kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy what</text><text start="91.14" dur="3.479">would it what would have to be true for</text><text start="92.46" dur="4.14">web 3 projects to build a network effect</text><text start="94.619" dur="4.381">together where everyone uses lens</text><text start="96.6" dur="4.62">protocol and so therefore everyone uses</text><text start="99.0" dur="4.38">lens protocol and anyone can build on</text><text start="101.22" dur="3.66">top of that if you&apos;re a builder in web 2</text><text start="103.38" dur="3.66">starting a social network you have to</text><text start="104.88" dur="4.379">start at zero and compete with Facebook</text><text start="107.04" dur="5.1">which has billions of users but on lens</text><text start="109.259" dur="4.441">protocol in web 3 you could start with</text><text start="112.14" dur="2.88">the entire lens social graph as</text><text start="113.7" dur="3.3">something that you could build on top of</text><text start="115.02" dur="4.08">and I think that&apos;s pretty profound found</text><text start="117.0" dur="3.78">if you&apos;ve studied how Network affects</text><text start="119.1" dur="4.68">her foundational to building</text><text start="120.78" dur="5.159">applications in the network page and how</text><text start="123.78" dur="3.96">web3 social could bring new users to the</text><text start="125.939" dur="3.18">space so I think the big implications</text><text start="127.74" dur="4.26">here are identity bootstrapping</text><text start="129.119" dur="4.921">financializing assets making it easier</text><text start="132.0" dur="3.66">to build things by starting with a</text><text start="134.04" dur="4.08">network effect and bringing new users to</text><text start="135.66" dur="5.34">the space for web 3 social vitalik</text><text start="138.12" dur="5.16">himself has identified web 3 social as a</text><text start="141.0" dur="5.879">thing

dur="3.599">projects that&apos;s making it happen so we</text><text start="153.42" dur="2.819">talk about the implications of that we</text><text start="154.739" dur="4.86">talk about Sony&apos;s

start="305.04" dur="3.0">working on lens protocol tell us what</text><text start="306.419" dur="3.56">lens protocol is tell us why you&apos;re</text><text start="308.04" dur="3.659">excited about lens protocol</text><text start="309.979" dur="4.061">yeah</text><text start="311.699" dur="5.881">um a lot of interesting questions and I</text><text start="314.04" dur="4.62">think um giving some background story so</text><text start="317.58" dur="2.58">with</text><text start="318.66" dur="4.56">um for the past years we&apos;ve been</text><text start="320.16" dur="6.72">creating a lot of accessibility with the</text><text start="323.22" dur="4.94">other protocol mainly access to uh Fair</text><text start="326.88" dur="3.9">financial</text><text start="328.16" dur="4.599">markets that are globally working and</text><text start="330.78" dur="4.32">transparent and</text><text start="332.759" dur="4.561">um I think that&apos;s what is has been the</text><text start="335.1" dur="4.5">benefit of defy that you can access from</text><text start="337.32" dur="5.099">anywhere and you don&apos;t have that kind of</text><text start="339.6" dur="5.52">a limitation into something where</text><text start="342.419" dur="5.821">everyone is part of in a permissionless</text><text start="345.12" dur="5.46">fashion with lens protocol we are</text><text start="348.24" dur="3.78">looking to actually give access to your</text><text start="350.58" dur="4.08">own</text><text start="352.02" dur="5.399">um social presence social identity and</text><text start="354.66" dur="5.039">your own social network so effectively</text><text start="357.419" dur="3.961">that&apos;s whatever you</text><text start="359.699" dur="3.72">um create</text><text start="361.38" dur="4.259">um in in Social presence should belong</text><text start="363.419" dur="4.861">to you your profile and it shouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="365.639" dur="5.34">locked in a particular platform but</text><text start="368.28" dur="6.18">everything you do in any Social Capital</text><text start="370.979" dur="5.461">you create on a platform or actually</text><text start="374.46" dur="4.38">protocol you should always own that and</text><text start="376.44" dur="4.5">be able to carry whatever applications</text><text start="378.84" dur="3.78">you&apos;re using and that is kind of like</text><text start="380.94" dur="3.72">the the vision that lens is trying to</text><text start="382.62" dur="4.26">solve</text><text start="384.66" dur="4.68">got it it kind of feels from the outside</text><text start="386.88" dur="3.9">like like your second act like you kind</text><text start="389.34" dur="4.199">of accomplished what you came to do with</text><text start="390.78" dur="5.28">Ave and now web3 social is the New</text><text start="393.539" dur="4.741">Frontier uh so it&apos;s it&apos;s neat to see you</text><text start="396.06" dur="4.38">to carry that momentum and and skills</text><text start="398.28" dur="4.68">into web3 social which I think vitalik</text><text start="400.44" dur="4.62">identified at ECC 2021 is one of the</text><text start="402.96" dur="4.26">next big opportunities in web 3 Beyond</text><text start="405.06" dur="3.66">defy so that literally traces your</text><text start="407.22" dur="4.319">career Arc</text><text start="408.72" dur="5.819">yeah I mean it&apos;s I I think with the work</text><text start="411.539" dur="5.94">with Ava we haven&apos;t been uh we haven&apos;t</text><text start="414.539" dur="5.1">finished where uh decentralized Finance</text><text start="417.479" dur="4.261">uh should be or where the other protocol</text><text start="419.639" dur="4.981">should be but it&apos;s in a healthy position</text><text start="421.74" dur="6.48">where the protocol itself is governed by</text><text start="424.62" dur="5.04">the community and not only there&apos;s uh</text><text start="428.22" dur="5.22">decentralized governance but there&apos;s</text><text start="429.66" dur="5.64">multiple Community contributors actually</text><text start="433.44" dur="2.819">um contributing to build the protocol as</text><text start="435.3" dur="2.58">well</text><text start="436.259" dur="4.201">um so it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of like an</text><text start="437.88" dur="4.56">interesting moment to take some of the</text><text start="440.46" dur="6.48">resources and actually build something</text><text start="442.44" dur="6.36">which brings uh more users into the web</text><text start="446.94" dur="4.979">trade space</text><text start="448.8" dur="6.119">yeah well I think the you know the the</text><text start="451.919" dur="4.56">the problems with web 2 social media are</text><text start="454.919" dur="3.601">kind of well stated in many other places</text><text start="456.479" dur="4.56">but I&apos;m wondering if we can just talk</text><text start="458.52" dur="4.5">really quickly about what you see as the</text><text start="461.039" dur="5.401">problem with web 2 social and how web3</text><text start="463.02" dur="7.019">social can solve some of that stuff</text><text start="466.44" dur="6.12">yeah I think most importantly uh uh when</text><text start="470.039" dur="4.681">we look into the history of how uh</text><text start="472.56" dur="5.34">social media was born is that you know</text><text start="474.72" dur="5.52">we got this very big accessibility uh</text><text start="477.9" dur="3.96">through internet so I was um you know</text><text start="480.24" dur="3.62">born and raised</text><text start="481.86" dur="5.04">um with the technology and with the</text><text start="483.86" dur="5.619">internet you know playing games</text><text start="486.9" dur="4.739">um online such as Counter-Strike</text><text start="489.479" dur="4.641">um just reading information across</text><text start="491.639" dur="6.96">globally by someone else that has</text><text start="494.12" dur="6.16">created uh that content in what uh web 2</text><text start="498.599" dur="4.981">social media</text><text start="500.28" dur="6.0">um actually did it made it very easy to</text><text start="503.58" dur="5.22">anyone to to create content and to</text><text start="506.28" dur="5.879">distribute and connect across the globe</text><text start="508.8" dur="6.9">and what happened in later in this part</text><text start="512.159" dur="5.641">is that because of the efficiencies many</text><text start="515.7" dur="3.899">of these platforms became uh very</text><text start="517.8" dur="5.099">centralized</text><text start="519.599" dur="5.881">um and meaning that effectively we</text><text start="522.899" dur="6.12">created networks uh which upon we&apos;re</text><text start="525.48" dur="6.72">relying uh for at the moment and with</text><text start="529.019" dur="6.241">web 360 social what happens is that</text><text start="532.2" dur="5.759">actually you really aren&apos;t creating uh</text><text start="535.26" dur="5.579">the benefit only for uh for these</text><text start="537.959" dur="6.961">applications but uh the whole identity</text><text start="540.839" dur="6.56">is built um upon uh your own social</text><text start="544.92" dur="5.4">graph and just taking an example when</text><text start="547.399" dur="6.401">anyone is creating content let&apos;s say in</text><text start="550.32" dur="4.86">tiktok or uh you&apos;re tweeting on in in</text><text start="553.8" dur="4.44">Twitter</text><text start="555.18" dur="6.18">um the the biggest benefit is that you</text><text start="558.24" dur="6.42">know Twitter gets content liquidity and</text><text start="561.36" dur="5.64">at the same time uh uses this as a</text><text start="564.66" dur="4.98">network effect to then data points to</text><text start="567.0" dur="5.22">know what they can actually sell or</text><text start="569.64" dur="5.52">advertise to the user so the users are</text><text start="572.22" dur="5.16">the product in web 3 social what we&apos;re</text><text start="575.16" dur="4.56">trying to solve is that</text><text start="577.38" dur="6.54">um you know actually whatever you create</text><text start="579.72" dur="6.9">you should be able to affect for example</text><text start="583.92" dur="4.859">and and have the control over your</text><text start="586.62" dur="4.68">social presence so for example you are</text><text start="588.779" dur="5.821">not locked into one particular platform</text><text start="591.3" dur="6.42">but you can actually have portability in</text><text start="594.6" dur="5.76">changing the Dynamics in a way where uh</text><text start="597.72" dur="5.34">first time ever it&apos;s the applications</text><text start="600.36" dur="4.74">and the algorithms that need to work uh</text><text start="603.06" dur="4.2">for your benefit and and actually</text><text start="605.1" dur="4.919">compete for your attention and making</text><text start="607.26" dur="5.4">better uh outcomes because otherwise you</text><text start="610.019" dur="5.101">would choose an algorithm that is uh</text><text start="612.66" dur="4.739">aligned with your principles and what</text><text start="615.12" dur="4.98">you&apos;re looking for and that&apos;s hard to do</text><text start="617.399" dur="4.801">in web 2 social because you&apos;re logged in</text><text start="620.1" dur="4.44">for example in Twitter&apos;s user experience</text><text start="622.2" dur="5.16">their algorithm</text><text start="624.54" dur="5.88">um and also their policies so it&apos;s about</text><text start="627.36" dur="5.159">actually making that accessibility and</text><text start="630.42" dur="3.3">freedom for the users and also freedom</text><text start="632.519" dur="4.32">for the developers to come and</text><text start="633.72" dur="3.96">contribute and build those experiences</text><text start="636.839" dur="2.521">um</text><text start="637.68" dur="3.659">so it seems like there&apos;s a network</text><text

dur="4.199">that&apos;s really exciting to me to me is</text><text start="655.62" dur="4.62">that with lens protocol it feels like if</text><text start="657.839" dur="5.101">I&apos;m building a web 3 Social Network I</text><text start="660.24" dur="5.099">can just tap into the lens protocol</text><text start="662.94" dur="4.56">social network and I can start on first</text><text start="665.339"

a powerful</text><text start="671.279" dur="5.461">thing that takes away the vendor lock-in</text><text start="673.62" dur="5.04">that a web 2 social network would have I</text><text start="676.74" dur="4.98">mean you know and lens is kind of taking</text><text start="678.66" dur="5.16">on the burden of of bootstrapping its</text><text start="681.72" dur="3.96">own network effect so that I as someone</text><text start="683.82" dur="3.06">who&apos;s building in web3 Social don&apos;t have</text><text start="685.68" dur="2.82">to and I think that that&apos;s a really</text><text

let&apos;s say uh</text><text start="694.2" dur="4.199">profile but actually these different</text><text start="696.24" dur="5.7">applications that are uh building</text><text start="698.399" dur="5.761">experiences they can curate uh the the</text><text start="701.94" dur="4.86">content and and affect the way that</text><text start="704.16" dur="5.16">content is submitted uh into the</text><text start="706.8" dur="3.599">protocol and how peers are finding each</text><text start="709.32" dur="3.36">other</text><text start="710.399" dur="3.901">um and connecting so for example you</text><text start="712.68" dur="4.92">could use the same</text><text start="714.3" dur="5.039">um the same handle uh with uh one</text><text start="717.6" dur="2.82">application that is focusing on let&apos;s</text><text start="719.339" dur="3.601">say</text><text start="720.42" dur="5.099">um microboking and you find most</text><text start="722.94" dur="4.68">interesting things there uh but with the</text><text start="725.519" dur="5.461">same actual profile you could use</text><text start="727.62" dur="5.52">another application that actually is</text><text start="730.98" dur="5.82">um curating you the music that you might</text><text start="733.14" dur="6.62">like and focusing on audio uh content</text><text start="736.8" dur="5.88">and actually cross using those different</text><text start="739.76" dur="5.199">data points for your behalf and you as a</text><text start="742.68" dur="6.18">user can choose what you want to use so</text><text start="744.959" dur="5.641">it&apos;s it&apos;s really uh it removes just is</text><text start="748.86" dur="3.539">that the fact that it removes the vendor</text><text start="750.6" dur="3.479">locking it just brings a lot of</text><text start="752.399" dur="3.841">opportunities like what you can actually</text><text start="754.079" dur="5.461">build and what the users can have</text><text start="756.24" dur="5.58">because it&apos;s not any more about these</text><text start="759.54" dur="4.14">platforms it&apos;s about like what</text><text start="761.82" dur="3.48">opportunities we now have and what we</text><text start="763.68" dur="3.3">could actually build that couldn&apos;t be</text><text start="765.3" dur="3.06">done before</text><text start="766.98" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="768.36" dur="4.08">activities the two platforms they can</text><text start="770.1" dur="5.4">keep they can be open right so let&apos;s say</text><text start="772.44" dur="5.1">Twitter could have an open API but the</text><text start="775.5" dur="3.66">risk is always that</text><text start="777.54" dur="4.68">um you know there&apos;s applications that</text><text start="779.16" dur="4.919">become bigger and might not be aligned</text><text start="782.22" dur="4.559">with their business model that&apos;s why</text><text start="784.079" dur="6.481">it&apos;s important to build uh social media</text><text start="786.779" dur="6.36">upon open source and and open protocols</text><text start="790.56" dur="4.38">like lens protocol hmm you know I forget</text><text start="793.139" dur="5.161">where I heard this but I had heard that</text><text start="794.94" dur="5.699">Jack dorsey&apos;s vision for Twitter was to</text><text start="798.3" dur="4.38">make it into a protocol but by the time</text><text start="800.639" dur="3.901">they got around to making that pivot</text><text start="802.68" dur="3.54">they were already a public corporation</text><text start="804.54" dur="4.08">that had all these reporting</text><text start="806.22" dur="5.16">requirements that had to do for their</text><text start="808.62" dur="5.339">fiduciary duty what was best for</text><text start="811.38" dur="4.44">investors and when they did the analysis</text><text start="813.959" dur="3.421">it wasn&apos;t best for investors for Twitter</text><text start="815.82" dur="3.84">to become a decentralized protocol</text><text start="817.38" dur="4.079">because they got so much ads out of</text><text start="819.66" dur="3.78">having the centralized protocol and so</text><text start="821.459" dur="3.961">it&apos;s interesting that there&apos;s a certain</text><text start="823.44" dur="3.899">lock-in for a web 2 company when you get</text><text start="825.42" dur="4.919">to a certain scale and so the innovation</text><text start="827.339" dur="4.5">of building a web 3 protocol almost by</text><text start="830.339" dur="3.541">definition would have to come from</text><text start="831.839" dur="3.421">someone who&apos;s more web 3 native than</text><text start="833.88" dur="2.88">Jack Dorsey</text><text start="835.26" dur="3.72">um or at least the Jack Dorsey that was</text><text start="836.76" dur="3.54">the CEO of the public corporation of</text><text start="838.98" dur="3.359">Twitter so</text><text start="840.3" dur="3.36">um this is I think it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s cool</text><text start="842.339" dur="2.641">and I&apos;ll just put a point on it by</text><text start="843.66" dur="3.54">saying that you&apos;re kind of front-running</text><text start="844.98" dur="3.24">Jack Dorsey on his own Vision with leads</text><text start="847.2" dur="4.62">here</text><text start="848.22" dur="5.82">yeah I think also like it&apos;s also it&apos;s</text><text start="851.82" dur="5.519">not only me building because like the</text><text start="854.04" dur="5.46">power of open protocols is that you</text><text start="857.339" dur="5.161">actually have a large group of people</text><text start="859.5" dur="7.38">that are contributing actively with with</text><text start="862.5" dur="7.26">IPS uh with with content and and making</text><text start="866.88" dur="3.899">sure that uh the the protocol is</text><text start="869.76" dur="2.579">something</text><text start="870.779" dur="4.441">that is aligned with the Community</text><text start="872.339" dur="4.981">Values and where they want to see the</text><text start="875.22" dur="3.96">web tree social going towards and I</text><text start="877.32" dur="4.8">think that&apos;s a key difference between a</text><text start="879.18" dur="5.399">business where you know you have uh</text><text start="882.12" dur="4.019">investor pressure and you have to</text><text start="884.579" dur="3.841">basically make profit at some point</text><text start="886.139" dur="5.041">versus you know you&apos;re building a public</text><text start="888.42" dur="4.859">good that uh the end goal is actually</text><text start="891.18" dur="6.54">creating something that is scalable</text><text start="893.279" dur="6.781">usable unopened opinion unopinionated</text><text start="897.72" dur="4.859">um and valuable for uh the whole</text><text start="900.06" dur="4.8">community so I think that&apos;s</text><text start="902.579" dur="5.341">um a very big difference and and power</text><text start="904.86" dur="6.419">that you get from uh these networks but</text><text start="907.92" dur="7.02">also like I&apos;ve I&apos;ve been looking into</text><text start="911.279" dur="6.06">um the the the idea of um Elon Musk</text><text start="914.94" dur="4.44">playing Twitter also there was uh</text><text start="917.339" dur="5.521">mentions about potential using</text><text start="919.38" dur="4.079">blockchain as a way of uh empowering</text><text start="922.86" dur="3.419">um</text><text start="923.459" dur="6.0">the application as well and I think</text><text start="926.279" dur="5.221">something that we haven&apos;t I would say</text><text start="929.459" dur="4.801">maybe like mainstream doesn&apos;t see is</text><text start="931.5" dur="5.459">that like how we&apos;re going towards</text><text start="934.26" dur="4.439">scalability at the moment so</text><text start="936.959" dur="4.44">um obviously recently with the ethereum</text><text start="938.699" dur="3.481">having merged that uh affected quite a</text><text start="941.399" dur="2.581">lot</text><text start="942.18" dur="3.599">um in the technical perspective but</text><text start="943.98" dur="3.719">there&apos;s a lot of innovation happening at</text><text start="945.779" dur="5.341">the moment on layer twos</text><text start="947.699" dur="6.061">which allows actually a very interesting</text><text start="951.12" dur="5.459">scalability which is quite interesting</text><text start="953.76" dur="4.98">for non-financial applications so I</text><text start="956.579" dur="5.161">think when people are looking from more</text><text start="958.74" dur="5.88">of a corporate perspective into the</text><text start="961.74" dur="5.159">blockchain and how to utilize it they</text><text start="964.62" dur="4.2">really are looking for the old stuff and</text><text start="966.899" dur="4.321">they don&apos;t really see that we&apos;re</text><text start="968.82" dur="6.36">actually working our way towards uh</text><text start="971.22" dur="6.479">scaling as a whole uh community so I</text><text start="975.18" dur="4.62">think that&apos;s like a kind of like a big</text><text start="977.699" dur="4.44">observation I made recently</text><text start="979.8" dur="5.399">hmm yeah it&apos;s interesting I mean the</text><text start="982.139" dur="4.681">upside for this is quite High uh a lot</text><text start="985.199" dur="4.32">of humanity spends a lot of their time</text><text start="986.82" dur="4.259">on and attention on social networks and</text><text start="989.519" dur="4.44">you think if you think about what is</text><text start="991.079" dur="5.461">their value of that routing algorithm on</text><text start="993.959" dur="4.8">social media is it is the optimization</text><text start="996.54" dur="4.02">function just sell them or ads get them</text><text start="998.759" dur="4.561">to buy more stuff</text><text start="1000.56" dur="5.76">um or could the optimization function in</text><text start="1003.32" dur="5.459">their feeds be forked and be used for</text><text start="1006.32" dur="5.28">any number of means whether it&apos;s selling</text><text start="1008.779" dur="4.92">more stuff or maybe using crypto to be</text><text start="1011.6" dur="4.5">good for the world maybe creating more</text><text start="1013.699" dur="4.08">public good for the world and so I just</text><text start="1016.1" dur="3.72">see a ton of upside as you&apos;re starting</text><text start="1017.779" dur="4.381">to think about scale for what lens</text><text start="1019.82" dur="4.2">protocol could be to the world because</text><text start="1022.16" dur="3.419">so much of Humanity&apos;s attention is</text><text start="1024.02" dur="3.899">routed in social media and I think that</text><text start="1025.579" dur="4.26">that number is really increasing</text><text start="1027.919" dur="4.38">and I think</text><text start="1029.839" dur="5.521">um the social media itself</text><text start="1032.299" dur="5.221">um being able to connect with your peers</text><text start="1035.36" dur="4.979">um is is very valuable for for the</text><text start="1037.52" dur="4.679">network itself right so that you have a</text><text start="1040.339" dur="5.34">means to distribute content and make the</text><text start="1042.199" dur="6.061">platform uh exciting place to spend time</text><text start="1045.679" dur="5.101">uh sharing ideas</text><text start="1048.26" dur="4.26">um or look for entertainment but also I</text><text start="1050.78" dur="3.42">think what&apos;s valuable</text><text start="1052.52" dur="5.159">um is actually then</text><text start="1054.2" dur="5.52">being able to use this uh data and and</text><text start="1057.679" dur="5.521">this particular building block in other</text><text start="1059.72" dur="5.579">parts of our lives so for example</text><text start="1063.2" dur="4.14">um Finance is a good example because we</text><text start="1065.299" dur="4.38">we&apos;ve always been talking about under</text><text start="1067.34" dur="5.699">collateralized loans and you know how we</text><text start="1069.679" dur="4.981">keep working on on China environment</text><text start="1073.039" dur="3.781">um and something that is interesting in</text><text start="1074.66" dur="4.379">real world is that when you move from</text><text start="1076.82" dur="5.16">one country to another you really don&apos;t</text><text start="1079.039" dur="6.421">Port your credit ratings with you or</text><text start="1081.98" dur="6.12">your credit history uh but using</text><text start="1085.46" dur="5.099">something like the uh data that you have</text><text start="1088.1" dur="5.34">on chain so so the power of the</text><text start="1090.559" dur="5.641">blockchain is that we have verified data</text><text start="1093.44" dur="4.68">uh verified actions so what what it</text><text start="1096.2" dur="4.04">means is that you can actually prove</text><text start="1098.12" dur="4.799">going from one place to another</text><text start="1100.24" dur="5.74">that you have certain data sets that are</text><text start="1102.919" dur="5.821">verified and that&apos;s very valuable</text><text start="1105.98" dur="3.36">um utility for using</text><text start="1108.74" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="1109.34" dur="5.28">something like a social graph</text><text start="1111.74" dur="5.4">um as a means of other use cases than</text><text start="1114.62" dur="4.98">social itself and I think that&apos;s where</text><text start="1117.14" dur="3.72">the bigger impact comes I I believe that</text><text start="1119.6" dur="2.88">there&apos;s going to be like you know</text><text start="1120.86" dur="4.439">there&apos;s there&apos;s billions of users in</text><text start="1122.48" dur="4.92">Social at the moment and I think uh</text><text start="1125.299" dur="4.74">that&apos;s the way to get more users into</text><text start="1127.4" dur="4.68">web3 uh through this non-financial</text><text start="1130.039" dur="5.281">applications but the bigger impact is</text><text start="1132.08" dur="5.4">that with D5 we created Global liquidity</text><text start="1135.32" dur="5.58">markets and with social we can create</text><text start="1137.48" dur="6.42">this kind of like a more Global uh data</text><text start="1140.9" dur="5.22">market and and use it for the users</text><text start="1143.9" dur="3.96">yeah I mean you know the second season</text><text start="1146.12" dur="3.72">of the Greenfield podcast is all about</text><text start="1147.86" dur="4.439">digital identity and reputation and</text><text start="1149.84" dur="4.74">that&apos;s because uh you know the internet</text><text start="1152.299" dur="4.62">of Finance is all about transacting with</text><text start="1154.58" dur="4.26">counterparties and in the real world</text><text start="1156.919" dur="3.841">when we transact with counterparties a</text><text start="1158.84" dur="4.02">lot of that depends on reputation you</text><text start="1160.76" dur="3.779">know when I get an Uber I only want to</text><text start="1162.86" dur="3.84">go with an Uber driver who&apos;s doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1164.539" dur="4.38">have a reputation for being dangerous</text><text start="1166.7" dur="5.099">who isn&apos;t creepy and will get me from A</text><text start="1168.919" dur="5.581">to B relatively quickly and um you know</text><text start="1171.799" dur="5.521">so uh if we can build this network</text><text start="1174.5" dur="4.98">effect of reputation in web 3 and it</text><text start="1177.32" dur="4.56">allows us to decide a little bit more</text><text start="1179.48" dur="4.439">freely who we transact with then it just</text><text start="1181.88" dur="4.32">opens up a whole lot more use cases for</text><text start="1183.919" dur="4.38">web 3 and I think what&apos;s cool about lens</text><text start="1186.2" dur="3.9">protocol is it can be this this kind of</text><text start="1188.299" dur="5.221">light in the darkness that is spinning</text><text start="1190.1" dur="5.819">off reputational data about its its</text><text start="1193.52" dur="3.36">users hopefully in a privacy preserving</text><text start="1195.919" dur="2.341">way</text><text start="1196.88" dur="3.9">um and in the intersection of social</text><text start="1198.26" dur="5.58">media and finance I think becomes really</text><text start="1200.78" dur="4.5">exciting at that point because the um</text><text start="1203.84" dur="2.94">there&apos;s a lot of things that you can do</text><text start="1205.28" dur="3.12">when you combine those things I think</text><text start="1206.78" dur="4.08">that in web 2 those things aren&apos;t</text><text start="1208.4" dur="4.08">combined so there&apos;s a lot of upside</text><text start="1210.86" dur="3.78">there</text><text start="1212.48" dur="5.1">yeah I think also that</text><text start="1214.64" dur="5.039">um the the beauty of the lens protocol</text><text start="1217.58" dur="3.599">is it&apos;s that you know once you create</text><text start="1219.679" dur="3.421">your profile</text><text start="1221.179" dur="4.88">um you have a lot of choices right so</text><text start="1223.1" dur="5.16">you could uh effectively</text><text start="1226.059" dur="6.701">reflect content through your own chain</text><text start="1228.26" dur="7.919">transaction store it on ipfs RV or store</text><text start="1232.76" dur="5.7">it completely privately in cloud or you</text><text start="1236.179" dur="4.62">can just like create a profile have that</text><text start="1238.46" dur="4.86">social graph but all content happens</text><text start="1240.799" dur="4.681">completely off chain so like it gives</text><text start="1243.32" dur="4.2">gives that flexibility</text><text start="1245.48" dur="4.92">um for the users and developers to</text><text start="1247.52" dur="5.58">decide how much of data for example they</text><text start="1250.4" dur="4.86">want to have on on chain what kind of</text><text start="1253.1" dur="4.68">data points might be valuable for you</text><text start="1255.26" dur="4.919">and the Uber example is very cool</text><text start="1257.78" dur="5.279">because normally when you look at human</text><text start="1260.179" dur="5.221">ratings you know you have like you might</text><text start="1263.059" dur="4.86">have drivers with</text><text start="1265.4" dur="4.74">um a few thousand of stars you know but</text><text start="1267.919" dur="3.901">it really doesn&apos;t tell you anything uh</text><text start="1270.14" dur="4.8">knowing that your friend used something</text><text start="1271.82" dur="6.719">or their friend use a

dur="4.86">example and it&apos;s a way also to you know</text><text start="1309.5" dur="4.799">think about like</text><text start="1311.539" dur="5.341">um creating like a strong social

interesting use</text><text start="1320.12" dur="3.78">cases</text><text start="1321.62" dur="4.26">yeah I think what&apos;s interesting is that</text><text start="1323.9" dur="4.08">through that six degrees of</text><text start="1325.88" dur="6.06">relationships that you can almost view</text><text start="1327.98" dur="5.46">that as a a a trust Network that&apos;s</text><text start="1331.94" dur="3.0">growing out when you have one degree of</text><text start="1333.44" dur="3.06">connection with someone you have more</text><text start="1334.94" dur="4.38">trust than if you have two than if you</text><text start="1336.5" dur="4.98">have three and what are the implications</text><text start="1339.32" dur="4.2">of that I think you gave the example of</text><text start="1341.48" dur="4.559">civil resistance which obviously matters</text><text start="1343.52" dur="4.5">a lot for quadratic funding and the work</text><text start="1346.039" dur="2.941">that I&apos;ve done at Bitcoin but you know</text><text start="1348.02" dur="3.12">we also talked about under</text><text start="1348.98" dur="4.86">collateralized loans earlier maybe I&apos;d</text><text start="1351.14"

really close</text><text start="1356.539" dur="5.161">relationship with on lens protocol or</text><text start="1358.7" dur="5.16">lenster uh and so I think that the the</text><text start="1361.7" dur="4.5">possibilities of that degree of</text><text start="1363.86" dur="4.799">connection in that relationship kind of</text><text start="1366.2" dur="5.4">become very very interesting</text><text start="1368.659" dur="6.301">yeah exactly it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s really</text><text start="1371.6" dur="5.579">valuable because we&apos;re able to do that</text><text start="1374.96" dur="5.219">um and start to use it very first time</text><text start="1377.179" dur="5.641">and lens protocol is just one part of</text><text start="1380.179" dur="5.88">identity and social graph also whatever</text><text start="1382.82" dur="6.18">you do and donate in git coin that&apos;s one</text><text start="1386.059" dur="6.12">part of the uh identity it&apos;s also a</text><text

dur="5.341">case so I really uh think it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="1418.7" dur="3.3">more about</text><text start="1420.26" dur="3.0">um creating creating interesting

about the example that</text><text start="1434.12" dur="5.4">you just gave of your lens profile and</text><text start="1436.7" dur="6.0">your git coin uh grants contributions</text><text

start="1451.1" dur="5.34">profile and identity and and in that</text><text start="1454.58" dur="3.78">plurality the base layer I think is is</text><text start="1456.44" dur="4.619">how you can come up with a diversity of</text><text start="1458.36" dur="4.38">lenses pun intended for how you view</text><text start="1461.059" dur="3.721">someone but also the fact that you can</text><text

in</text><text start="1472.82" dur="4.62">your social graph in one place and I</text><text start="1474.74" dur="5.34">think that the possibilities of this are</text><text start="1477.44" dur="5.3">it would be easy to understate them and</text><text start="1480.08" dur="5.4">I don&apos;t think we know exactly what the</text><text start="1482.74" dur="4.78">where this is all snowballing towards</text><text start="1485.48" dur="4.38">but it feels like it&apos;s something that&apos;s</text><text start="1487.52" dur="5.159">really important given how big web 2</text><text start="1489.86" dur="4.02">social has got gotten to be</text><text start="1492.679" dur="2.88">um you know if we can all climb this</text><text start="1493.88" dur="4.98">network effect of building web3 social</text><text start="1495.559" dur="5.701">together then there&apos;s there&apos;s just going</text><text start="1498.86" dur="4.92">to be this beautiful blossoming of use</text><text start="1501.26" dur="4.38">cases in the next Market cycle that that</text><text start="1503.78" dur="4.019">come out of that and I&apos;m really excited</text><text start="1505.64" dur="4.86">for I&apos;m just here for it</text><text start="1507.799" dur="5.76">I also think about the whole kind of</text><text start="1510.5" dur="6.12">like the two web three social concept</text><text start="1513.559" dur="5.161">and I I believe what we have here is</text><text start="1516.62" dur="4.86">that a lot of the users are actually</text><text start="1518.72" dur="4.62">creating a lot of Social Capital</text><text start="1521.48" dur="4.14">um into the bigger platforms and</text><text start="1523.34" dur="5.339">whenever you&apos;re locked in your your</text><text start="1525.62" dur="5.22">Capital has some value obviously like</text><text start="1528.679" dur="4.38">you can monetize already</text><text start="1530.84" dur="3.36">um from that value so let&apos;s say that if</text><text start="1533.059" dur="4.081">you have</text><text start="1534.2" dur="5.52">um you know 100 000 followers in in</text><text start="1537.14" dur="4.98">Twitter or somewhere else you can</text><text start="1539.72" dur="3.72">capitalize that traffic one way or</text><text start="1542.12" dur="3.48">another</text><text start="1543.44" dur="4.92">um you can do collaborations</text><text start="1545.6" dur="5.699">um and and so forth indirectly but you</text><text start="1548.36" dur="5.22">can&apos;t actually like fake that value uh</text><text start="1551.299" dur="5.941">with you because it&apos;s it&apos;s part of your</text><text start="1553.58" dur="6.0">Social Capital and your prisons and what</text><text start="1557.24" dur="5.16">we want to do is that we want to</text><text start="1559.58" dur="6.12">actually change the idea of that that</text><text start="1562.4" dur="6.06">actually the social capital is is part</text><text start="1565.7" dur="4.979">of you and you should be able to have</text><text start="1568.46" dur="4.14">full control over it and according to</text><text start="1570.679" dur="3.781">also to the</text><text start="1572.6" dur="4.34">um including the monetization so for</text><text start="1574.46" dur="4.98">example that you should be able to</text><text start="1576.94" dur="6.04">decide what you can share to your</text><text start="1579.44" dur="6.119">audience and and monetize it directly</text><text start="1582.98" dur="4.5">um and and having that kind of like a</text><text start="1585.559" dur="4.62">direct relationship with your audience</text><text start="1587.48" dur="4.86">so in lens protocol what&apos;s fascinating</text><text start="1590.179" dur="4.021">is that all the content that you</text><text start="1592.34" dur="5.4">actually create the user generated</text><text start="1594.2" dur="7.14">content can be an asset class so for</text><text start="1597.74" dur="8.52">example that if I really like a post</text><text start="1601.34" dur="8.819">from let&apos;s say Kevin your profile let&apos;s</text><text start="1606.26" dur="6.48">say you have an interesting idea of refi</text><text start="1610.159" dur="4.681">and and basically how to make D5 more</text><text start="1612.74" dur="4.02">Greener for example I can collect that</text><text start="1614.84" dur="4.62">of course because it&apos;s culturally</text><text start="1616.76" dur="5.22">relevant to me or it can be some art for</text><text start="1619.46" dur="6.0">example or music or or whatever is the</text><text start="1621.98" dur="6.299">the content type and I can take it and I</text><text start="1625.46" dur="5.28">can collect it as an nft either as a</text><text start="1628.279" dur="4.801">free or you can set a fee for the</text><text start="1630.74" dur="6.38">collection so it&apos;s a way to directly to</text><text start="1633.08" dur="6.36">monetize and using user generated assets</text><text start="1637.12" dur="4.659">user generated content as an asset class</text><text start="1639.44" dur="5.04">on on lens</text><text start="1641.779" dur="4.441">right uh well since you used me as an</text><text start="1644.48" dur="5.64">example I&apos;ve got to show my lens profile</text><text start="1646.22" dur="3.9">so follow me milwaukee.lens</text><text start="1650.179" dur="3.6">um and then uh yeah I mean you&apos;re kind</text><text start="1652.34" dur="3.6">of breaking my brain in which you talk</text><text start="1653.779" dur="4.801">about content as an asset class I know</text><text start="1655.94" dur="5.4">that you come from Ave uh and you know</text><text start="1658.58" dur="5.579">the language of capital it feels like in</text><text start="1661.34" dur="4.14">the language of information and objects</text><text start="1664.159" dur="3.481">you&apos;re kind of blending here and it&apos;s</text><text start="1665.48" dur="3.54">it&apos;s breaking my brains my brain in a</text><text start="1667.64" dur="3.539">couple ways and I&apos;m not sure the exact</text><text start="1669.02" dur="5.58">implications of it but</text><text start="1671.179" dur="5.701">um the ability to monetize posts and</text><text start="1674.6" dur="4.02">monetize your work your your Social</text><text start="1676.88" dur="3.36">Capital</text><text start="1678.62" dur="4.74">um feels like something that follows</text><text start="1680.24" dur="4.799">naturally in a way in web in web 3 just</text><text start="1683.36" dur="4.08">given the open source Financial nature</text><text start="1685.039" dur="4.38">of it and given how much value Facebook</text><text start="1687.44" dur="3.96">captures from all of our this is like</text><text start="1689.419" dur="3.541">ten dollars per active user per quarter</text><text start="1691.4" dur="3.36">or something like that what would it</text><text start="1692.96" dur="4.26">look like if the users were routed that</text><text start="1694.76" dur="3.539">that capital and what would be possible</text><text start="1697.22" dur="2.52">there</text><text start="1698.299" dur="4.561">um and I&apos;ll also connect this with this</text><text start="1699.74" dur="4.439">idea from as you know I I found a git</text><text start="1702.86" dur="2.64">coin which is built on bitcoin grants</text><text start="1704.179" dur="3.841">which is built on quadratic funding it&apos;s</text><text start="1705.5" dur="4.62">one of Glenn Wiles ideas and</text><text start="1708.02" dur="4.98">um another idea in radical Market that</text><text start="1710.12" dur="5.58">Glenn Weil put out was uh data as labor</text><text start="1713.0" dur="5.94">so this idea that um you know as we&apos;re</text><text start="1715.7" dur="5.88">trying to figure out how to fund a uh a</text><text start="1718.94" dur="4.32">more digital economy and if AI is</text><text start="1721.58" dur="4.199">replacing work what if we viewed</text><text start="1723.26" dur="5.1">everyone&apos;s data emissions online as</text><text start="1725.779" dur="4.561">their labor and started monetizing that</text><text start="1728.36" dur="4.679">work and it to me that connects back to</text><text start="1730.34" dur="4.8">what you said about nfts and</text><text start="1733.039" dur="3.541">um and and monetizing your content is</text><text start="1735.14" dur="3.3">that is that there&apos;s maybe an</text><text start="1736.58" dur="3.54">opportunity to provide an income for</text><text start="1738.44" dur="4.38">people through the thing the things that</text><text start="1740.12" dur="4.98">they do in their web 3 their web3 social</text><text start="1742.82" dur="4.8">so that that gets really exciting for me</text><text start="1745.1" dur="4.079">and it&apos;s it&apos;s neat that</text><text start="1747.62" dur="2.939">um you know if that happens then I think</text><text start="1749.179" dur="4.681">that we&apos;ll be in the same sister</text><text start="1750.559" dur="4.74">portfolio of Glenn Weil ideas uh of of</text><text start="1753.86" dur="3.54">helping the world out in green pilling</text><text start="1755.299" dur="5.281">the world just from different angles</text><text start="1757.4" dur="5.759">I definitely think because like the um</text><text start="1760.58" dur="4.5">you know the the current state is in</text><text start="1763.159" dur="4.62">social media that we produce a lot of</text><text start="1765.08" dur="4.88">data we produce a lot of content uh</text><text start="1767.779" dur="4.5">which is value it might be informative</text><text start="1769.96" dur="4.42">educative it might be entertaining</text><text start="1772.279" dur="5.101">there&apos;s some sort of a Content that</text><text start="1774.38" dur="6.419">we&apos;re producing uh on a daily</text><text start="1777.38" dur="5.1">uh basis and it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s extremely</text><text start="1780.799" dur="4.021">actually like it&apos;s relatively hard to</text><text start="1782.48" dur="5.46">monetize it because you know you&apos;re not</text><text start="1784.82" dur="4.32">really uh paid for the data that you</text><text start="1787.94" dur="4.14">provide</text><text start="1789.14" dur="5.399">um in social media platforms so the idea</text><text start="1792.08" dur="4.74">of we never when we were building lens</text><text start="1794.539" dur="5.701">protocol we never kind of like</text><text start="1796.82" dur="5.82">um like monetization wasn&apos;t our like one</text><text start="1800.24" dur="4.679">of the main things we&apos;re trying to solve</text><text start="1802.64" dur="4.74">so monetization is something that we</text><text start="1804.919" dur="4.441">started to think about like what if we</text><text start="1807.38" dur="4.679">actually created a couple of ways to</text><text start="1809.36" dur="4.38">monetize for the for the users</text><text start="1812.059" dur="3.72">um and the creators directly on the</text><text start="1813.74" dur="4.319">protocol level and that&apos;s where we added</text><text start="1815.779" dur="5.76">the idea of what if everything you</text><text start="1818.059" dur="6.541">produce today as content</text><text start="1821.539" dur="6.961">um can be an nft for example and and</text><text start="1824.6" dur="7.38">users can collect it and why it&apos;s uh</text><text start="1828.5" dur="7.14">interesting is that today what what nft</text><text start="1831.98" dur="7.98">is proved is that creators especially</text><text start="1835.64" dur="7.8">digital artists they have direct uh way</text><text start="1839.96" dur="6.06">to go to their communities with nfts and</text><text start="1843.44" dur="5.88">to their audiences and and create create</text><text start="1846.02" dur="5.7">a community around their work and now</text><text start="1849.32" dur="4.5">the same is happening a bit with music</text><text start="1851.72" dur="4.14">and fds</text><text start="1853.82" dur="4.92">um that you see music NXT is being</text><text start="1855.86" dur="5.88">collected and for me this isn&apos;t that new</text><text start="1858.74" dur="5.88">idea because I collect vinyls so I</text><text start="1861.74" dur="5.4">collect physical copies of music that I</text><text start="1864.62" dur="6.24">can hear pretty much anywhere where I</text><text start="1867.14" dur="6.779">you know want so like I&apos;m actually when</text><text start="1870.86" dur="5.4">it comes to Art music</text><text start="1873.919" dur="6.12">um or even expanding the idea to content</text><text start="1876.26" dur="6.12">I&apos;m not actually paying for the the</text><text start="1880.039" dur="5.041">digital good I&apos;m

dur="5.7">um and also a reward for that creativity</text><text start="1890.74" dur="5.74">that that affects my mind and I think</text><text start="1893.96" dur="5.339">that&apos;s where the groundbreaking</text><text start="1896.48" dur="5.76">uh thinking happens that you know maybe</text><text start="1899.299" dur="5.88">we don&apos;t need IP anymore maybe we</text><text start="1902.24" dur="6.36">actually have on-chain verified data</text><text start="1905.179" dur="6.901">on-chain commercial rights a new ways to</text><text start="1908.6" dur="6.059">to create monetization and Empower these</text><text start="1912.08" dur="5.819">um creators and not just only musicians</text><text start="1914.659" dur="5.461">but anyone who creates even memes</text><text start="1917.899" dur="5.88">um could monetize and we already have</text><text start="1920.12" dur="5.88">examples where retroactively we as a</text><text start="1923.779" dur="5.341">community have both</text><text

this some</text><text start="2691.599" dur="3.901">of the stuff we&apos;re doing is is</text><text start="2693.4" dur="3.48">definitely really hard it&apos;s probably the</text><text start="2695.5" dur="3.96">most hardest</text><text start="2696.88" dur="6.54">um exercise we&apos;ve we&apos;ve had for a while</text><text start="2699.46" dur="5.46">I I think building Defy is difficult in</text><text start="2703.42" dur="3.899">the sense that you know you have a lot</text><text start="2704.92" dur="4.199">of value to stake so like it&apos;s hard to</text><text start="2707.319" dur="5.821">say but now it&apos;s when you know you have</text><text start="2709.119" dur="6.48">billions uh billions in for the value in</text><text start="2713.14" dur="4.5">the smartphone checks but here is like</text><text start="2715.599" dur="4.74">here the kind of like a challenge if</text><text start="2717.64" dur="4.26">that what if you don&apos;t get you know the</text><text start="2720.339" dur="4.561">the people you want or the developers</text><text start="2721.9" dur="6.179">you want and and yeah what if what if</text><text start="2724.9" dur="5.28">you you take the wrong strategy so it</text><text start="2728.079" dur="4.861">really is the hardest game I ever played</text><text start="2730.18" dur="5.1">uh but it the the interesting part is</text><text start="2732.94" dur="5.04">that it feels different when there&apos;s a</text><text start="2735.28" dur="4.62">community it feels different when you&apos;re</text><text start="2737.98" dur="3.66">not really doing it by yourself and</text><text start="2739.9" dur="4.98">there&apos;s so many people</text><text start="2741.64" dur="5.52">um helping and I think um I I think we</text><text start="2744.88" dur="5.4">don&apos;t need to beat Facebook and Twitter</text><text start="2747.16" dur="5.76">I think we need to build new venues and</text><text start="2750.28" dur="4.74">new interest graphs and and basically</text><text start="2752.92" dur="5.22">new experiences where people want to go</text><text start="2755.02" dur="5.64">that&apos;s the only way to you know take the</text><text start="2758.14" dur="5.1">traction out of centralized uh social</text><text start="2760.66" dur="4.26">media platforms because those networks</text><text start="2763.24" dur="4.379">are the hardest to compete not only</text><text start="2764.92" dur="4.98">because of the ban awareness but because</text><text start="2767.619" dur="4.2">of the fact that the users can&apos;t take</text><text start="2769.9" dur="4.199">their existing Social Capital out of</text><text start="2771.819" dur="4.921">there so you need to actually you know</text><text start="2774.099" dur="6.0">build for new audiences and new</text><text start="2776.74" dur="6.06">experiences and and and combine those</text><text start="2780.099" dur="4.141">together and have that Network effect uh</text><text start="2782.8" dur="3.6">and doing it together with all these</text><text start="2784.24" dur="3.9">applications it&apos;s actually very cool to</text><text start="2786.4" dur="4.32">see like those applications that are</text><text start="2788.14" dur="5.479">built on top of lens they interact with</text><text start="2790.72" dur="6.3">each other ongoing bases and we share</text><text start="2793.619" dur="6.761">resources how to build and it&apos;s really</text><text start="2797.02" dur="5.819">Let&apos;s Build Together uh momentum that is</text><text start="2800.38" dur="5.219">taking it uh further now</text><text start="2802.839" dur="5.581">yeah yeah I feel that</text><text start="2805.599" dur="3.601">um and it&apos;s really neat to see</text><text start="2808.42" dur="2.46">um</text><text start="2809.2" dur="3.18">I I think you&apos;re humble to say that we</text><text start="2810.88" dur="4.02">want to build a Facebook or a Twitter</text><text start="2812.38" dur="4.02">killer but but I&apos;ll say it I that I hope</text><text start="2814.9" dur="2.82">that the lens Community gets there and I</text><text start="2816.4" dur="3.12">know that that&apos;s an intent that a lot of</text><text start="2817.72" dur="3.24">people have out there</text><text start="2819.52" dur="4.799">um</text><text start="2820.96" dur="4.92">uh I think that we have we have uh about</text><text start="2824.319" dur="4.881">10 10 more minutes left on the episode</text><text start="2825.88" dur="4.86">how should we spend it Sonny</text><text start="2829.2" dur="4.96">[Music]</text><text start="2830.74" dur="8.16">talk about maybe more of public goods</text><text start="2834.16" dur="6.24">and and that perspective as well sure um</text><text start="2838.9" dur="4.5">and maybe how</text><text start="2840.4" dur="5.82">the space has evolved and then ended</text><text start="2843.4" dur="5.52">like for where it&apos;s going towards</text><text start="2846.22" dur="4.139">well I mean I have I I have a sort of</text><text start="2848.92" dur="3.12">prompt on public goods that&apos;s maybe a</text><text start="2850.359" dur="4.381">blending of get coin and lens that it</text><text start="2852.04" dur="4.92">might be interesting uh thread to pull</text><text start="2854.74" dur="3.9">um and that&apos;s the uh so so git coin is</text><text start="2856.96" dur="3.119">known for Bitcoin grants which is built</text><text start="2858.64" dur="5.939">on this thing called quadratic funding</text><text start="2860.079" dur="7.081">basically a matching campaign that that</text><text start="2864.579" dur="4.681">funds grants according to their</text><text start="2867.16" dur="4.74">crowdfunding results but it funds grants</text><text start="2869.26" dur="5.339">that have a broader base of support as</text><text start="2871.9" dur="4.74">opposed to one-to-one matching so Sani</text><text start="2874.599" dur="3.601">if you have a grant that has ten dollars</text><text start="2876.64" dur="3.24">from 10 contributors and I have a grant</text><text start="2878.2" dur="3.48">that has ten dollars from one</text><text start="2879.88" dur="4.14">contributor then you&apos;ll get like 90 of</text><text start="2881.68" dur="4.919">the matching pool and so one of the</text><text start="2884.02" dur="3.9">things that I&apos;ve just experimented with</text><text start="2886.599" dur="3.181">through with my experience of doing</text><text start="2887.92" dur="3.659">quadratic funding on bitcoin is that</text><text start="2889.78" dur="3.9">Bitcoin has a news feed basically</text><text start="2891.579" dur="3.901">Bitcoin became a social network during</text><text start="2893.68" dur="3.54">the grants rounds when all this activity</text><text start="2895.48" dur="3.96">is happening and people are showing each</text><text start="2897.22" dur="4.02">other uh grants to each other and one of</text><text start="2899.44" dur="4.02">the things we experimented was was ex</text><text start="2901.24" dur="3.54">was replacing the like button which</text><text start="2903.46" dur="3.359">everyone&apos;s familiar with on Twitter and</text><text start="2904.78" dur="3.9">on Facebook with a micro tip button</text><text start="2906.819" dur="3.481">where stani if you do something that I</text><text start="2908.68" dur="4.38">think is great I can send you 30 cents</text><text start="2910.3" dur="3.96">and and you know what happened was no</text><text start="2913.06" dur="3.299">one really used it because who cares</text><text start="2914.26" dur="3.66">about 30 cents but what we did was we</text><text start="2916.359" dur="3.361">took the quadratic funding matching</text><text start="2917.92" dur="3.12">engine that we were using on bitcoin</text><text start="2919.72" dur="4.8">grants and we pointed it at the news</text><text start="2921.04" dur="6.24">feed and ran a I think it was a 200 quad</text><text start="2924.52" dur="4.92">funding matching round every week on the</text><text start="2927.28" dur="4.799">I called it mini quadratic funding and</text><text start="2929.44" dur="4.08">what that meant was that uh the same</text><text start="2932.079" dur="3.061">logic that applies to get coin grants</text><text start="2933.52" dur="4.5">applied to the Social Network on git</text><text start="2935.14" dur="4.26">coin and uh I could send you 30 cents</text><text start="2938.02" dur="3.12">and you would actually get nine dollars</text><text start="2939.4" dur="3.719">because of the quadratic matching that</text><text start="2941.14" dur="4.02">would come and what this did was I saw</text><text start="2943.119" dur="4.381">the behavior shift on bitcoin from</text><text start="2945.16" dur="5.1">people liking stuff which is just like</text><text start="2947.5" dur="5.099">oh this elicits a dopamine response from</text><text start="2950.26" dur="4.559">me to if the news feed was based off of</text><text start="2952.599" dur="5.161">how many micro tips you got it almost</text><text start="2954.819" dur="4.5">shifts the the this the data generation</text><text start="2957.76" dur="4.2">goes from</text><text start="2959.319" dur="4.981">um does this elicit a dopamine response</text><text start="2961.96" dur="4.02">in me to uh is this person actually</text><text start="2964.3" dur="2.94">helpful or me because I&apos;m spending you</text><text start="2965.98" dur="3.359">know likes are like the ultimate</text><text start="2967.24" dur="3.78">coin there&apos;s infinite of them but I can</text><text start="2969.339" dur="3.601">only give a certain amount of of money</text><text start="2971.02" dur="4.86">to you and so we built this quadratic</text><text start="2972.94" dur="5.159">funding social network but um and and</text><text start="2975.88" dur="4.62">and sent I I think on the order of</text><text start="2978.099" dur="3.961">thousands of micro tips using it and it</text><text start="2980.5" dur="3.839">was also a way of me speedrunning like</text><text start="2982.06" dur="4.62">finding civil attackers on the get coin</text><text start="2984.339" dur="4.141">thing and um anyway eventually gas</text><text start="2986.68" dur="3.659">prices went up and I got too busy with</text><text start="2988.48" dur="4.139">Bitcoin other Bitcoin stuff and this</text><text start="2990.339" dur="4.201">experiment fell by the wayside but if</text><text start="2992.619" dur="3.421">anyone is out there uh that is</text><text start="2994.54" dur="3.48">interested in rebuilding this with me</text><text start="2996.04" dur="3.96">please get in touch I would love to Fork</text><text start="2998.02" dur="3.9">Leinster and build a quadratic lenser</text><text start="3000.0" dur="4.26">that is a combination of Bitcoin</text><text start="3001.92" dur="4.56">grants&apos;s quadratic matching engine and</text><text start="3004.26" dur="4.62">the lenser UI and I think that there&apos;s</text><text start="3006.48" dur="4.619">maybe an interesting signal generation</text><text start="3008.88" dur="3.9">mechanism that&apos;s a combination public</text><text start="3011.099" dur="4.561">goods and people helping each other out</text><text start="3012.78" dur="6.0">and web3 social that that we can put in</text><text start="3015.66" dur="5.04">the pot and stir it so uh yeah I&apos;m</text><text start="3018.78" dur="5.28">curious what your reaction is is to that</text><text start="3020.7" dur="5.52">I I I I think that that is exactly where</text><text start="3024.06" dur="4.32">like the nobility is and and The</text><text start="3026.22" dur="5.16">Innovation and using something like that</text><text start="3028.38" dur="5.28">has been like that&apos;s an experience that</text><text start="3031.38" dur="4.62">is very exciting and you know it it</text><text start="3033.66" dur="5.939">creates this interesting fairness and</text><text start="3036.0" dur="6.06">also balance with the uh donations and</text><text start="3039.599" dur="4.801">the in the funding so what&apos;s interesting</text><text start="3042.06" dur="6.299">for me is from the lens perspective</text><text start="3044.4" dur="6.24">going back to the idea of you know you</text><text start="3048.359" dur="6.361">know all the people in the world by six</text><text start="3050.64" dur="6.84">degrees taking a lens social graph and</text><text start="3054.72" dur="5.04">and actually pointing to two two degrees</text><text start="3057.48" dur="4.5">so let&apos;s say that</text><text start="3059.76" dur="3.0">um because I follow you you follow</text><text start="3061.98" dur="2.579">um</text><text start="3062.76" dur="4.46">uh someone else you know that someone</text><text start="3064.559" dur="5.76">else can actually uh vote on that</text><text start="3067.22" dur="6.099">quadratic funding and we</text><text start="3070.319" dur="5.52">we ensure that there is more civil</text><text start="3073.319" dur="3.901">resistance uh there and you can actually</text><text start="3075.839" dur="3.541">like you can you can make it even</text><text start="3077.22" dur="4.32">further like it can be three degrees so</text><text start="3079.38" dur="4.86">if I follow you you follow Scott and</text><text start="3081.54" dur="4.38">Scott follows let&apos;s say</text><text start="3084.24" dur="4.74">um David Hoffman</text><text start="3085.92" dur="5.639">and and and and and basically David</text><text start="3088.98" dur="4.8">Hoffman can actually then vote to you</text><text start="3091.559" dur="4.861">can like the tools are there today to</text><text start="3093.78" dur="4.86">actually make it more civil resistant by</text><text start="3096.42" dur="5.58">using your social graph and and this</text><text start="3098.64" dur="5.699">kind of like a degree of separation we</text><text start="3102.0" dur="5.7">are using it in commenting so you know</text><text start="3104.339" dur="5.941">in typically in Twitter you see uh the</text><text start="3107.7" dur="5.28">the fake scammy unit swap comments</text><text start="3110.28" dur="4.68">whenever you post you know that&apos;s hard</text><text start="3112.98" dur="5.16">to do when you select this module on</text><text start="3114.96" dur="6.18">Lancer for example because it basically</text><text start="3118.14" dur="4.199">removes the idea reduces the boats uh</text><text start="3121.14" dur="3.0">pretty much to the minimum because</text><text start="3122.339" dur="4.141">someone needs to actually follow that</text><text start="3124.14" dur="5.16">boat in your social network that being</text><text start="3126.48" dur="5.4">able to comment and I think putting</text><text start="3129.3" dur="5.279">these two things together you actually</text><text start="3131.88" dur="5.52">create a use case for social graph</text><text start="3134.579" dur="5.581">outside the social media and you make</text><text start="3137.4" dur="5.28">that quadratic funding possible on a</text><text start="3140.16" dur="4.5">scale and that&apos;s a big game changer and</text><text start="3142.68" dur="4.7">for sure this is something that we would</text><text start="3144.66" dur="5.459">love to give a grant if someone wants to</text><text start="3147.38" dur="5.26">build and all the guidance I think this</text><text start="3150.119" dur="5.101">is powerful use cases and Kevin this is</text><text start="3152.64" dur="4.26">what I was talking about why it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="3155.22" dur="4.92">make sense to go after Twitter and</text><text start="3156.9" dur="6.0">Facebook it&apos;s way more actually fun</text><text start="3160.14" dur="4.56">easier uh productive to build those</text><text start="3162.9" dur="3.48">novel use cases that are actually</text><text start="3164.7" dur="4.44">helping</text><text start="3166.38" dur="5.459">um and one simple example there is there</text><text start="3169.14" dur="4.979">there is um one project built</text><text start="3171.839" dur="4.861">um by Newt Newt is an experiment and</text><text start="3174.119" dur="4.561">experimentational unit and other that</text><text start="3176.7" dur="4.8">basically has free hands to build</text><text start="3178.68" dur="6.24">anything so they decided to build a meme</text><text start="3181.5" dur="6.72">mixer on top of the lens protocol so you</text><text start="3184.92" dur="5.46">can create a completely new Meme and</text><text start="3188.22" dur="4.44">someone else can come and remix it and</text><text start="3190.38" dur="3.66">then you share the the collect fees that</text><text start="3192.66" dur="4.62">you&apos;re generating with the original</text><text start="3194.04" dur="4.44">Trader and whoever remix it remixes the</text><text start="3197.28" dur="3.0">chain</text><text start="3198.48" dur="5.099">um so it&apos;s basically taking something</text><text start="3200.28" dur="5.88">that exists and it just improving it and</text><text start="3203.579" dur="5.821">I think novel use cases and solving new</text><text start="3206.16" dur="4.62">problems is the way way to actually win</text><text start="3209.4" dur="3.06">Netflix</text><text start="3210.78" dur="3.42">it&apos;s beautiful I mean you know it</text><text start="3212.46" dur="3.119">reminds me of being a web 2 entrepreneur</text><text start="3214.2" dur="3.18">and there was this big there&apos;s this kind</text><text start="3215.579" dur="3.901">of meme back then where it was like the</text><text start="3217.38" dur="3.84">developing world is not gonna come on to</text><text start="3219.48" dur="4.44">desktop computers they&apos;re gonna LeapFrog</text><text start="3221.22" dur="4.379">that by doing everything mobile first</text><text start="3223.92" dur="4.679">um and as a result there was a huge</text><text start="3225.599" dur="4.201">freaking market for mobile uh apps that</text><text start="3228.599" dur="3.181">was powered by the development</text><text start="3229.8" dur="4.62">developing world and I almost see a</text><text start="3231.78" dur="4.62">symmetry here with web 2 social where</text><text start="3234.42" dur="4.38">you&apos;re not trying to go to where</text><text start="3236.4" dur="4.439">Facebook and Twitter are you&apos;re kind of</text><text start="3238.8" dur="5.519">building something new that leapfrog&apos;s</text><text start="3240.839" dur="5.341">what web2 social is with web3 and you</text><text start="3244.319" dur="3.54">know users won&apos;t switch for 10 more</text><text start="3246.18" dur="3.899">utility but they&apos;ll switch for 10x more</text><text start="3247.859" dur="4.141">utility and when those 10x use cases</text><text start="3250.079" dur="3.78">start appearing then I think that that&apos;s</text><text start="3252.0" dur="3.54">when it gets really cool and you know</text><text start="3253.859" dur="3.781">for a lot of people maybe maybe earning</text><text start="3255.54" dur="4.079">from your data if you can earn 10 to 50</text><text start="3257.64" dur="3.9">per day from posting on lens and</text><text start="3259.619" dur="4.141">building your social network that&apos;s the</text><text start="3261.54" dur="4.019">equivalent of a job uh like you&apos;re</text><text start="3263.76" dur="3.96">you&apos;re 10x better than Facebook at that</text><text start="3265.559" dur="4.861">point yeah and and so I&apos;m really really</text><text start="3267.72" dur="5.7">curious to see uh where this is all</text><text start="3270.42" dur="5.28">going as the momentum continues to build</text><text start="3273.42" dur="4.919">yeah definitely I mean there&apos;s 80 000</text><text start="3275.7" dur="4.68">profiles at the moment in in lens</text><text start="3278.339" dur="4.081">protocol it&apos;s still</text><text start="3280.38" dur="4.8">um closed beta so it&apos;s the the white</text><text start="3282.42" dur="5.639">listing goes if you donate it to to git</text><text start="3285.18" dur="6.12">coin crons or let&apos;s say you are part of</text><text start="3288.059" dur="5.52">a developer Dao or or</text><text start="3291.3" dur="5.22">um boys clubs or any any of the kind of</text><text start="3293.579" dur="4.621">like a white listed dials um which is</text><text start="3296.52" dur="5.22">kind of like an experimentational way of</text><text start="3298.2" dur="6.419">using web3 footprint in uh getting folks</text><text start="3301.74" dur="4.079">into the social graph and curating it a</text><text start="3304.619" dur="4.98">bit</text><text start="3305.819" dur="6.54">um what I think is that</text><text start="3309.599" dur="5.341">um over time what happens now for</text><text start="3312.359" dur="6.24">example now per single profile is</text><text start="3314.94" dur="6.3">earning roughly two two and a half uh</text><text start="3318.599" dur="4.441">dollars per profile obviously the more</text><text start="3321.24" dur="4.5">the social graph grows it the number</text><text start="3323.04" dur="4.319">goes lower yeah but there there&apos;s</text><text start="3325.74" dur="3.599">already creators that are posting</text><text start="3327.359" dur="5.7">content with</text><text start="3329.339" dur="7.141">um piece like uh one two dollars Alpha</text><text start="3333.059" dur="6.121">Matic 0.1 Matic and like small amounts</text><text start="3336.48" dur="5.16">and just like small content</text><text start="3339.18" dur="4.2">um and over a long period of time like</text><text start="3341.64" dur="3.9">it might make a difference but we will</text><text start="3343.38" dur="4.739">probably see there&apos;s going to be a range</text><text start="3345.54" dur="6.059">for that and this is just monetization</text><text start="3348.119" dur="6.021">models we built based on nfts you can</text><text start="3351.599" dur="5.76">add various kind of uh monetization</text><text start="3354.14" dur="4.179">mechanisms that that could be very cool</text><text start="3357.359" dur="3.601">um yeah</text><text start="3358.319" dur="5.04">this is the part of building web3</text><text start="3360.96" dur="4.139">um way where you don&apos;t try to solve</text><text start="3363.359" dur="3.901">everything just focusing on one</text><text start="3365.099" dur="3.841">particular building block and let the</text><text start="3367.26" dur="3.66">rest of the community to to figure out</text><text start="3368.94" dur="3.78">the the rest of the pieces</text><text start="3370.92" dur="4.5">yeah you know what I think is cool here</text><text start="3372.72" dur="4.26">is the super modularity of this in which</text><text start="3375.42" dur="4.919">you&apos;ve got profiles and you&apos;ve got</text><text start="3376.98" dur="5.16">follows and you&apos;ve got likes and um and</text><text start="3380.339" dur="2.581">within within</text><text start="3382.14" dur="2.699">um</text><text start="3382.92" dur="3.78">lens and there&apos;s this idea of super</text><text start="3384.839" dur="3.48">modularity where like the sum is greater</text><text start="3386.7" dur="3.48">than the whole of its parts like it&apos;s</text><text start="3388.319" dur="3.421">literally super modular</text><text start="3390.18" dur="3.96">um in which the just salt of all these</text><text start="3391.74" dur="3.78">things together uh all these little</text><text start="3394.14" dur="4.439">modules that do one thing and do them</text><text start="3395.52" dur="4.62">well uh together sort of exponentially</text><text start="3398.579" dur="3.361">grows into something that&apos;s really big</text><text start="3400.14" dur="4.08">and powerful and I not only see that</text><text start="3401.94" dur="3.659">within lens but also within your work uh</text><text start="3404.22" dur="3.839">stani because I know that you&apos;re</text><text start="3405.599" dur="4.46">associated with Ave and I have taken</text><text start="3408.059" dur="5.101">that momentum to lens and then there&apos;s</text><text start="3410.059" dur="4.78">Rave like this party that you all host</text><text start="3413.16" dur="3.0">every every event and it&apos;s like it&apos;s</text><text start="3414.839" dur="3.601">almost like you have this like ecosystem</text><text start="3416.16" dur="4.679">of modules and sort of projects that</text><text start="3418.44" dur="4.5">kind of share Social Capital</text><text start="3420.839" dur="3.661">um and in the momentum the energy</text><text start="3422.94" dur="2.94">scaffolds between them and I just think</text><text start="3424.5" dur="3.96">it&apos;s really cool to see the momentum I</text><text start="3425.88" dur="5.28">can&apos;t wait to see uh how big the the Ave</text><text start="3428.46" dur="4.68">Empire is by by 2025 or the lens</text><text start="3431.16" dur="3.84">protocol is by then because it all seems</text><text start="3433.14" dur="4.62">like it&apos;s growing together</text><text start="3435.0" dur="4.98">yeah I mean hopefully it creates new new</text><text start="3437.76" dur="4.62">opportunities for Builders to to to</text><text start="3439.98" dur="5.4">build fascinating pro products and</text><text start="3442.38" dur="5.04">onboard more Talent into the space so um</text><text start="3445.38" dur="5.1">I&apos;m super super</text><text start="3447.42" dur="5.76">um optimistic in the state of um uh web3</text><text start="3450.48"
