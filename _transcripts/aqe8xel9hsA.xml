start="206.959" dur="4.081">your work as an imagination activist so</text><text start="208.879" dur="3.841">can you tell me what that is</text><text start="211.04" dur="2.559">yes for sure so</text><text start="212.72" dur="2.64">um</text><text start="213.599" dur="4.321">imagination activists are basically</text><text start="215.36" dur="3.84">activists powered by the imagination so</text><text start="217.92" dur="3.28">i believe like one of the biggest</text><text start="219.2" dur="4.0">problems of our time at the moment is</text><text start="221.2" dur="4.56">the narrowing and the boxing in of</text><text start="223.2" dur="4.8">imagination so that folks don&apos;t even</text><text start="225.76" dur="4.72">have a sense of what&apos;s not on the table</text><text start="228.0" dur="4.56">in terms of what kind of lives we need</text><text start="230.48" dur="4.64">what kind of society we live in</text><text start="232.56" dur="5.2">um who it&apos;s possible to be so it&apos;s that</text><text start="235.12" dur="5.28">realm of the unimaginable that i think</text><text start="237.76" dur="5.039">is getting smaller and smaller um</text><text start="240.4" dur="4.399">and it&apos;s kind of driven by having been</text><text start="242.799" dur="4.481">part of extinction rebellion and feeling</text><text start="244.799" dur="4.08">like part of the reason extinction</text><text start="247.28" dur="3.599">rebellion petered out was because there</text><text start="248.879" dur="4.08">was a movement based on despair</text><text start="250.879" dur="3.92">so a lot of people who are solar punks</text><text start="252.959" dur="4.081">understand this that we need movements</text><text start="254.799" dur="4.0">that are also driven by hope and active</text><text start="257.04" dur="3.36">hope and imagination</text><text start="258.799" dur="2.96">got it can you see more about extinction</text><text start="260.4" dur="3.12">rebellion for those of us who aren&apos;t</text><text start="261.759" dur="5.041">familiar with it</text><text start="263.52" dur="5.36">yes so extinction rebellion was a</text><text start="266.8" dur="6.0">movement of hundreds of thousands of</text><text start="268.88" dur="7.039">people um most active i&apos;d say between</text><text start="272.8" dur="4.0">2019 and 2020 of like around about that</text><text start="275.919" dur="4.0">time</text><text start="276.8" dur="6.959">um founded by a group of founders uh</text><text start="279.919" dur="5.761">largely in the uk so gail bradbroke um</text><text start="283.759" dur="4.16">roger hallam a couple others and it was</text><text start="285.68" dur="4.56">a it was an environmental movement um</text><text start="287.919" dur="3.84">and had greta as one of the figureheads</text><text start="290.24" dur="3.519">and um</text><text start="291.759" dur="4.88">yeah they organized these large-scale</text><text start="293.759" dur="4.561">rebellions so taking over like trafalgar</text><text start="296.639" dur="3.84">square and and</text><text start="298.32" dur="4.96">yeah orchestrating like large</text><text start="300.479" dur="5.041">um direct actions and so extinction</text><text start="303.28" dur="4.4">rebellion was kind of a reaction to the</text><text start="305.52" dur="4.959">negative and your work as an imagination</text><text start="307.68" dur="4.4">activist is trying to chart a positive</text><text start="310.479" dur="4.72">path forward and break away from the</text><text start="312.08" dur="5.76">status quo is that more or less correct</text><text start="315.199" dur="6.081">i&apos;d say so yeah and it&apos;s also driven by</text><text start="317.84" dur="5.68">the belief that that um</text><text start="321.28" dur="4.56">the solutions that we are trying to</text><text start="323.52" dur="4.959">create for for the global problems that</text><text start="325.84" dur="4.0">we face are being created by a certain</text><text start="328.479" dur="3.521">way of thinking</text><text start="329.84" dur="3.52">um so there&apos;s almost like a layer</text><text start="332.0" dur="4.08">underneath of everything that we&apos;re</text><text start="333.36" dur="4.88">doing as activists as innovators as you</text><text start="336.08" dur="4.48">know technology builders like there are</text><text start="338.24" dur="3.36">there are scripts that run our ways of</text><text start="340.56" dur="3.12">thinking</text><text start="341.6" dur="3.76">which in themselves create the problems</text><text start="343.68" dur="3.44">so the solutions we create actually end</text><text start="345.36" dur="4.08">up being the new problems which is</text><text start="347.12" dur="4.16">especially apparent in technology like</text><text start="349.44" dur="3.44">new technologies are created and then</text><text start="351.28" dur="3.199">they create a whole bunch of new</text><text start="352.88" dur="4.08">problems as well so i&apos;m really</text><text start="354.479" dur="4.56">interested in how do we shift perception</text><text start="356.96" dur="3.84">and the way that we think and imagine in</text><text start="359.039" dur="3.761">that deeper level</text><text start="360.8" dur="4.08">right and i know that you&apos;re the founder</text><text start="362.8" dur="3.679">of moral imagining can you say more</text><text start="364.88" dur="3.2">about your work that you that you&apos;re</text><text start="366.479" dur="3.521">doing there</text><text start="368.08" dur="4.72">yeah so and that that actually uh</text><text start="370.0" dur="3.919">directly relates to i&apos;d say web three</text><text start="372.8" dur="3.119">and distributed governance and</text><text start="373.919" dur="3.12">decentralized organizing so</text><text start="375.919" dur="4.321">for</text><text start="377.039" dur="5.041">about uh six years i was really working</text><text start="380.24" dur="4.48">in the realm of distributed governance</text><text start="382.08" dur="5.36">that started off by uh running an</text><text start="384.72" dur="5.28">education company when i was 22 with a</text><text start="387.44" dur="4.479">couple other folks which we tried to run</text><text start="390.0" dur="3.199">as a non-hierarchical or decentralized</text><text start="391.919" dur="4.161">organization</text><text start="393.199" dur="4.881">um which ended up being a massive mess</text><text start="396.08" dur="3.839">and way more difficult than i could have</text><text start="398.08" dur="3.52">imagined which would basically spark my</text><text start="399.919" dur="2.72">interest in like how do you actually do</text><text start="401.6" dur="3.039">that like</text><text start="402.639" dur="3.441">i&apos;d never thought about the fact that</text><text start="404.639" dur="2.881">there are these different blueprints for</text><text start="406.08" dur="3.2">the ways that you can run organizations</text><text start="407.52" dur="4.239">and suddenly that opened up this sense</text><text start="409.28" dur="4.16">of like oh this is like a sandbox where</text><text start="411.759" dur="4.481">you know the corporation and the top</text><text start="413.44" dur="4.319">down pyramid is not the only way and</text><text start="416.24" dur="3.12">we&apos;ve got all of this new technology</text><text start="417.759" dur="4.56">where we can actually run</text><text start="419.36" dur="6.08">um you know organizations on software so</text><text start="422.319" dur="6.16">that kind of opened up um</text><text start="425.44" dur="5.28">a whole bunch of work and getting</text><text start="428.479" dur="4.401">organized getting involved in something</text><text start="430.72" dur="5.52">called in spiral which is basically like</text><text start="432.88" dur="4.719">an organization that uses web 2 software</text><text start="436.24" dur="4.32">to organize so collective decision</text><text start="437.599" dur="6.0">making participatory budgeting</text><text start="440.56" dur="5.039">and so that was a really big part of my</text><text start="443.599" dur="5.44">last 10 years was working in distributed</text><text start="445.599" dur="6.0">governance but while i was in that</text><text start="449.039" dur="4.801">realm i realize that the core thing i&apos;m</text><text start="451.599" dur="4.561">interested in is how we make decisions</text><text start="453.84" dur="3.84">and even if we get all of these new</text><text start="456.16" dur="3.12">mechanisms for making decisions in</text><text start="457.68" dur="5.359">different ways and making decisions in</text><text start="459.28" dur="5.759">collective ways if we can&apos;t imagine the</text><text start="463.039" dur="3.521">kinds of futures in the kind of world</text><text start="465.039" dur="4.401">that we want to live in and if our</text><text start="466.56" dur="5.199">imaginations are actually narrowed down</text><text start="469.44" dur="4.24">then it doesn&apos;t matter how</text><text start="471.759" dur="3.44">collective or yeah how many different</text><text start="473.68" dur="3.68">ways we have to make decisions we won&apos;t</text><text start="475.199" dur="5.201">make decisions that are for the benefit</text><text start="477.36" dur="4.8">of the planet and the benefit of people</text><text start="480.4" dur="4.96">yeah your experience there kind of</text><text start="482.16" dur="4.4">reminds me of oh building a dow and the</text><text start="485.36" dur="2.72">work that we&apos;ve done with get coined out</text><text start="486.56" dur="3.44">i always feel like i&apos;m toggling back and</text><text start="488.08" dur="4.48">forth between my aperture of awareness</text><text start="490.0" dur="4.96">being do we build bitcoin grants or do</text><text start="492.56" dur="4.4">we build the machine that builds bitcoin</text><text start="494.96" dur="3.44">grants and i always feel like i&apos;m</text><text start="496.96" dur="3.28">getting gummed up</text><text start="498.4" dur="3.68">with building the dow when i really want</text><text start="500.24" dur="2.72">to focus on building bitcoin grants</text><text start="502.08" dur="2.64">because</text><text start="502.96" dur="4.079">you don&apos;t realize how much you get out</text><text start="504.72" dur="4.64">of the box with a company you get you</text><text start="507.039" dur="4.16">get payroll from china you get you get</text><text start="509.36" dur="3.679">benefits you get</text><text start="511.199" dur="3.921">all these different sas products and by</text><text start="513.039" dur="3.36">trying to reinv but by trying to build a</text><text start="515.12" dur="2.64">dow you have to build all those things</text><text start="516.399" dur="2.961">from scratch or at least they&apos;re service</text><text start="517.76" dur="3.68">providers that are not as advanced and</text><text start="519.36" dur="4.0">i&apos;m always stuck between inventing a new</text><text start="521.44" dur="4.24">way of doing work so that we can do the</text><text start="523.36" dur="3.919">work versus just kind of yolo doing the</text><text start="525.68" dur="3.52">work yourself and i&apos;m seeing a parallel</text><text start="527.279" dur="3.441">there with your work in trying to create</text><text start="529.2" dur="3.44">imagination but also trying to create a</text><text start="530.72" dur="4.32">non-hierarchical organization that&apos;s</text><text start="532.64" dur="4.4">doing that you built a non-hierarchical</text><text start="535.04" dur="4.4">organization</text><text start="537.04" dur="4.32">in web 2 in the inspiral network can you</text><text start="539.44" dur="4.88">say what you learned from doing that and</text><text start="541.36" dur="6.32">and how you&apos;re kind of approaching web3</text><text start="544.32" dur="6.0">yeah for sure um so i was in spiral</text><text start="547.68" dur="6.32">already existed when i joined um it was</text><text start="550.32" dur="5.92">founded in 2010 and i was was also the</text><text start="554.0" dur="4.72">creator of the software lumio and the</text><text start="556.24" dur="4.08">the software co-budget as well</text><text start="558.72" dur="4.08">um so it was interesting because it was</text><text start="560.32" dur="5.12">sort of like a web 2 experience of a dao</text><text start="562.8" dur="5.12">so i was already trained in a kind of</text><text start="565.44" dur="5.519">web 2 dao before i moved into working in</text><text start="567.92" dur="6.08">web 3 daos and arriving into</text><text start="570.959" dur="6.481">the web 3 scene and around 20 like late</text><text start="574.0" dur="5.12">2017 2018 it became really apparent to</text><text start="577.44" dur="4.16">me that a lot of the skills and the</text><text start="579.12" dur="5.44">capacities that this group of humans can</text><text start="581.6" dur="4.88">inspire about 160 people</text><text start="584.56" dur="4.0">many of them based in new zealand but</text><text start="586.48" dur="4.08">essentially a global

start="592.959" dur="4.0">and i have to remind myself that before</text><text start="594.399" dur="4.321">the pandemic like working on zoom and</text><text start="596.959" dur="3.601">like working in this distributed way was</text><text start="598.72" dur="4.32">actually really quite rare like for most</text><text start="600.56" dur="4.24">people their everyday jobs like most</text><text start="603.04" dur="4.56">people had never tried zoom had never</text><text start="604.8" dur="5.76">used uh digital software to coordinate</text><text start="607.6" dur="4.96">in in a way um so we were you know that</text><text start="610.56" dur="4.0">experience i felt like</text><text start="612.56" dur="4.16">at the time i was one of the only people</text><text start="614.56" dur="4.719">in

around 2018</text><text start="634.0" dur="3.839">was that a lot of the skills and the</text><text start="635.519" dur="4.401">capacities in terms of the soft skills</text><text start="637.839" dur="3.601">like decentralized leadership and</text><text start="639.92" dur="3.2">collective decision making and the fact</text><text start="641.44" dur="3.68">that there are these menus of different</text><text start="643.12" dur="3.92">ways of making decisions a lot of that</text><text start="645.12" dur="3.52">seemed to be very absent in the web 3</text><text start="647.04" dur="3.68">scene so</text><text start="648.64" dur="4.56">um i could see a massive need for that i</text><text start="650.72" dur="4.16">feel like that&apos;s being um kind of met</text><text start="653.2" dur="3.52">quite a lot more now like a lot of like</text><text start="654.88" dur="4.16">sociocracy and holacracy folks are</text><text start="656.72" dur="3.76">starting to stream into the web 3 scene</text><text start="659.04" dur="4.64">which is great and the other thing i</text><text start="660.48" dur="5.2">felt was massively missing in both the</text><text start="663.68"

scene</text><text start="671.6" dur="5.359">was the the planet like ecology and and</text><text start="674.56" dur="4.64">like where is that so i love absolutely</text><text start="676.959" dur="4.481">love as you know the whole green pill</text><text start="679.2" dur="5.44">meme i love that this is about like</text><text start="681.44" dur="5.6">bringing that solo punk green regen</text><text start="684.64" dur="3.92">um topic into web 3 because i felt like</text><text start="687.04" dur="2.479">it&apos;s really really been missing not just</text><text start="688.56" dur="2.719">in this</text><text start="689.519" dur="4.081">area but also in like all of the other</text><text start="691.279" dur="4.081">distributed horizontal governance worlds</text><text start="693.6" dur="5.359">as well</text><text start="695.36" dur="5.52">right yeah absolutely i i&apos;m curious what</text><text start="698.959" dur="3.44">what you learned it feels like you&apos;ve</text><text start="700.88" dur="3.28">kind of been front running this whole</text><text start="702.399" dur="4.241">decentralized organization thing by</text><text start="704.16" dur="4.56">doing it in web 2 before web 3 existed</text><text start="706.64" dur="4.48">what did you learn from lumio and in</text><text start="708.72" dur="4.48">spiral and and all those years that</text><text start="711.12" dur="4.399">could possibly be taken forward</text><text start="713.2" dur="4.8">into web3</text><text start="715.519" dur="4.32">such a great question i think my like</text><text start="718.0" dur="3.839">one of the key learnings was that</text><text start="719.839" dur="2.8">hierarchy isn&apos;t the problem like when</text><text start="721.839" dur="2.161">you</text><text start="722.639" dur="2.88">and my</text><text start="724.0" dur="3.519">friend rich bartlett has written a great</text><text start="725.519" dur="3.841">article on this which i can dig out and</text><text start="727.519" dur="3.841">we can include in the show notes so it</text><text start="729.36" dur="4.4">was really the sense of like hierarchy</text><text start="731.36" dur="4.719">is being you know is the the demon that</text><text start="733.76" dur="4.0">needs to be like slayed and actually we</text><text start="736.079" dur="3.361">need to move to a fully decentralized</text><text start="737.76" dur="3.12">system and then everything will be fair</text><text start="739.44" dur="4.399">and like as long as we can just like</text><text start="740.88" dur="4.399">learn the skills like within the web 2</text><text start="743.839" dur="3.041">distributed governance world it was like</text><text start="745.279" dur="4.881">if we can just learn the skills and the</text><text start="746.88" dur="5.28">decision making protocols um well enough</text><text start="750.16" dur="3.84">then we&apos;ll be able to like have this</text><text start="752.16" dur="3.84">harmonic organizing where everything is</text><text start="754.0" dur="4.079">fair and just and i see the kind of</text><text start="756.0" dur="4.399">parallel in the web 3c and is like if we</text><text start="758.079" dur="3.841">could just like solve uh coordination or</text><text start="760.399" dur="3.44">like decision you know like all of these</text><text start="761.92" dur="4.32">like protocols if we could get like the</text><text start="763.839" dur="4.881">perfect voting system and the perfect</text><text start="766.24" dur="4.399">like ways to solve like the free rider</text><text start="768.72" dur="4.16">problem like all of this coordination</text><text start="770.639" dur="4.161">stuff like then we&apos;ll we&apos;ll have harmony</text><text start="772.88" dur="3.199">but what became really clear was like</text><text start="774.8" dur="3.92">actually</text><text start="776.079" dur="4.641">the problem is not at the level of uh</text><text start="778.72" dur="3.52">necessarily at the level of organizing</text><text start="780.72" dur="4.16">and structures and that&apos;s what really</text><text start="782.24" dur="4.32">drove me into working in imagination</text><text start="784.88" dur="3.759">because what i saw i think there&apos;s two</text><text start="786.56" dur="3.92">ways to approach the same problem like</text><text start="788.639" dur="4.401">one of them is coordination like</text><text start="790.48" dur="4.64">decision making structures or encoded</text><text start="793.04" dur="4.32">um you know basically encoded ways of</text><text start="795.12" dur="3.76">coordinating on a blockchain or you go</text><text start="797.36" dur="3.279">and start working at the level of</text><text start="798.88" dur="3.68">culture and at the level of like human</text><text start="800.639" dur="2.801">development and so moral imagination is</text><text start="802.56" dur="3.04">about</text><text start="803.44" dur="4.0">uh helping build the capacity of</text><text start="805.6" dur="3.44">building ethics and values and</text><text start="807.44" dur="2.639">imagination so bringing those two</text><text start="809.04" dur="2.72">together</text><text start="810.079" dur="2.76">um but to go back to your original</text><text start="811.76" dur="4.0">question</text><text start="812.839" dur="5.161">um what i felt was was the big learning</text><text start="815.76" dur="3.84">from in spiral was that it&apos;s not that</text><text start="818.0" dur="2.32">hierarchy is the problem it&apos;s actually</text><text start="819.6" dur="2.479">the</text><text start="820.32" dur="3.759">kind of that&apos;s almost like a category</text><text start="822.079" dur="5.12">error like the issue issue is at the</text><text start="824.079" dur="4.961">level of what kind of leadership and</text><text start="827.199" dur="3.281">what kind of organizing you have like is</text><text start="829.04" dur="3.919">there accountability is there</text><text start="830.48" dur="4.88">transparency in the system is there a</text><text start="832.959" dur="4.721">flow of power and you can have</text><text start="835.36" dur="3.839">really unhealthy decentralized systems</text><text start="837.68" dur="2.959">where it looks like it&apos;s decentralized</text><text start="839.199" dur="3.841">but actually the power dynamics are</text><text start="840.639" dur="4.32">really unhealthy and you don&apos;t have this</text><text start="843.04" dur="3.52">cycling of power you don&apos;t have</text><text start="844.959" dur="4.081">transparency i mean within blockchains</text><text start="846.56" dur="4.079">that&apos;s that&apos;s less of a problem um but</text><text start="849.04" dur="4.72">you know you could have like apparent</text><text start="850.639" dur="5.841">transparency by having a bunch of data</text><text start="853.76" dur="3.68">that is um available for people to see</text><text start="856.48" dur="2.96">like</text><text start="857.44" dur="3.519">you know like in a dao but actually a</text><text start="859.44" dur="3.36">lot of the really key information of</text><text start="860.959" dur="4.24">like who who actually makes the</text><text start="862.8" dur="4.24">decisions who has that like soft</text><text start="865.199" dur="4.0">influence is hidden so you get this</text><text start="867.04" dur="3.52">tyranny of structurelessness and there&apos;s</text><text start="869.199" dur="3.361">a great essay like the tyranny of</text><text start="870.56" dur="3.76">structurelessness is like a probably one</text><text start="872.56" dur="3.36">of the best things that i</text><text start="874.32" dur="3.6">ended up um</text><text start="875.92" dur="3.279">yeah finding within that time it&apos;s a</text><text start="877.92" dur="2.96">it&apos;s an essay that</text><text start="879.199" dur="4.481">lays out that problem</text><text start="880.88" dur="4.079">um i think i actually you tweeted at one</text><text start="883.68" dur="2.64">point saying like</text><text start="884.959" dur="3.841">i&apos;m trying to like learn from</text><text start="886.32" dur="4.48">decentralized organizations and that was</text><text start="888.8" dur="4.08">like one of the key things and i think</text><text start="890.8" dur="4.64">like for anybody who&apos;s interested like</text><text start="892.88" dur="4.16">interviewing like 10 people from</text><text start="895.44" dur="3.12">distributed organizations about their</text><text start="897.04" dur="3.76">experiences and their hardships is</text><text start="898.56" dur="4.48">probably one of the best ways to get um</text><text start="900.8" dur="3.36">the learning of of how to organize in</text><text start="903.04" dur="3.039">that way</text><text start="904.16" dur="3.76">right turning of the structurelessness</text><text start="906.079" dur="3.921">is canon i think</text><text start="907.92" dur="3.68">in this space and hopefully those of us</text><text start="910.0" dur="3.519">who have read it have come across it as</text><text start="911.6" dur="3.679">a purely intellectual exercise not</text><text start="913.519" dur="3.921">because we&apos;re stuck in a tyranny of the</text><text start="915.279" dur="4.24">structurelessness somewhere and we&apos;re</text><text start="917.44" dur="4.24">looking to to name it</text><text start="919.519" dur="4.641">yeah yeah exactly</text><text start="921.68" dur="4.0">yeah it&apos;s humans trying to organize it</text><text start="924.16" dur="3.039">it seems to be yeah pretty much</text><text start="925.68" dur="2.48">unavoidable</text><text start="927.199" dur="2.721">yeah</text><text start="928.16" dur="4.4">well i&apos;m wondering if you can if we can</text><text start="929.92" dur="4.0">pull that thread of moral imagining and</text><text start="932.56" dur="3.12">i wonder if you can take us away from</text><text start="933.92" dur="4.56">the status quo what kind of worlds could</text><text start="935.68" dur="4.959">be possible and what tools can our</text><text start="938.48" dur="3.68">audience out there use in order to</text><text start="940.639" dur="4.0">imagine what possible futures are</text><text start="942.16" dur="5.2">plausible or desirable and</text><text start="944.639" dur="3.681">and and lead us there tell us about</text><text start="947.36" dur="2.719">moral</text><text start="948.32" dur="4.56">imagining</text><text start="950.079" dur="5.601">yeah certainly thank you um so i&apos;d say</text><text start="952.88" dur="5.12">the two there are many different ways of</text><text start="955.68" dur="4.32">using imagination and and moral</text><text start="958.0" dur="4.72">imaginations is a research and design</text><text start="960.0" dur="4.88">studio to develop those tools especially</text><text start="962.72" dur="4.96">around collective imagination</text><text start="964.88" dur="4.8">um i&apos;d say like the two main areas of</text><text start="967.68" dur="4.079">imagining that that we&apos;re developing and</text><text start="969.68" dur="3.2">have developed to this point are like</text><text start="971.759" dur="3.52">the first</text><text start="972.88" dur="5.04">tool is around using imagination to</text><text start="975.279" dur="3.761">expand the moral circle of concern</text><text start="977.92" dur="2.24">so</text><text start="979.04" dur="4.4">when you&apos;re thinking about how do we</text><text start="980.16" dur="5.44">make decisions or who or what is</text><text start="983.44" dur="5.199">considered in a decision</text><text start="985.6" dur="5.12">using imagination to actually um</text><text start="988.639" dur="4.401">expand your perception to look through</text><text start="990.72" dur="4.64">the eyes of a future generation human</text><text start="993.04" dur="4.0">like seven generations into the future</text><text start="995.36" dur="4.479">and actually use that like really</text><text start="997.04" dur="4.799">radical shift in perception to then make</text><text start="999.839" dur="3.44">decisions that that look completely</text><text start="1001.839" dur="3.92">different to the ones you would make if</text><text start="1003.279" dur="4.8">you were just in your default mode</text><text start="1005.759" dur="4.161">perception of like you as a human with</text><text start="1008.079" dur="4.801">your family with your friends with your</text><text start="1009.92" dur="5.039">like political ideology so that&apos;s like</text><text start="1012.88" dur="4.959">really one of the the vectors that we</text><text start="1014.959" dur="4.081">use imagination to stretch the mind so</text><text start="1017.839" dur="2.401">um</text><text start="1019.04" dur="2.56">looking through the eyes of a future</text><text start="1020.24" dur="4.48">generation human looking through the</text><text start="1021.6" dur="5.52">eyes of a non-human actor so really</text><text start="1024.72" dur="3.359">trying to make that like invisible</text><text start="1027.12" dur="2.719">um</text><text start="1028.079" dur="2.72">the invisible actors who are currently</text><text start="1029.839" dur="2.881">not</text><text start="1030.799" dur="3.921">accounted for within the system like</text><text start="1032.72" dur="5.119">helping those become visible</text><text start="1034.72" dur="5.28">um and helping people also embed within</text><text start="1037.839" dur="3.921">their context and history so using</text><text start="1040.0" dur="4.559">imagination to</text><text start="1041.76" dur="4.88">um bring alive this like very cosmic</text><text start="1044.559" dur="6.081">sense of being a human being that is the</text><text start="1046.64" dur="5.6">result of a long chain of evolution with</text><text start="1050.64" dur="4.32">you know with many different chapters</text><text start="1052.24" dur="4.48">and many different um creatures that</text><text start="1054.96" dur="4.32">have given rise to you being here today</text><text start="1056.72" dur="4.8">so it&apos;s also in a sense like religion</text><text start="1059.28" dur="4.48">and like paganism and animism used to do</text><text start="1061.52" dur="5.519">that for us it used to take the atomized</text><text start="1063.76" dur="5.12">human and give us ways of expanding our</text><text start="1067.039" dur="3.281">perception so that the decisions we&apos;d</text><text start="1068.88" dur="2.799">make you know love thy neighbor like</text><text start="1070.32" dur="3.76">these very basic</text><text start="1071.679" dur="4.24">rules were helping like bolster our</text><text start="1074.08" dur="3.68">decision-making and and you know and the</text><text start="1075.919" dur="3.921">weights that we organized as a society</text><text start="1077.76" dur="3.52">so that&apos;s one of the major areas that</text><text start="1079.84" dur="3.199">we&apos;re really interested in developing</text><text start="1081.28" dur="4.88">imagination that could eventually be</text><text start="1083.039" dur="4.961">part of governance so part of the way we</text><text start="1086.16" dur="3.04">run organizations</text><text start="1088.0" dur="3.44">or part of the way that we make</text><text start="1089.2" dur="4.4">democratic decisions and actually there</text><text start="1091.44" dur="4.4">are a couple of friends of mine who are</text><text start="1093.6" dur="4.079">we&apos;re collaborating around like how do</text><text start="1095.84" dur="4.16">you embed this kind of perception into</text><text start="1097.679" dur="4.801">organizations so like how do you</text><text start="1100.0" dur="4.64">bring a river onto the board of an</text><text start="1102.48" dur="4.16">organization and how could that river be</text><text start="1104.64" dur="4.48">given a voice and how could that also be</text><text start="1106.64" dur="4.399">connected with then let&apos;s say dividends</text><text start="1109.12" dur="4.16">from the organization going to that</text><text start="1111.039" dur="4.161">river and humans then also coordinating</text><text start="1113.28" dur="4.48">to protect and regenerate the river so</text><text start="1115.2" dur="4.719">these really interesting ways of</text><text start="1117.76" dur="4.88">reconnecting human beings and</text><text start="1119.919" dur="4.88">organizations with the natural world and</text><text start="1122.64" dur="4.08">also bringing that perception in super</text><text start="1124.799" dur="4.561">interesting so that&apos;s like a whole</text><text start="1126.72" dur="4.72">bucket of of the imagination world and</text><text start="1129.36" dur="4.4">how that connects to governance</text><text start="1131.44" dur="5.119">and then on the other side um</text><text start="1133.76" dur="5.12">you&apos;ve got the more uh let&apos;s say like</text><text start="1136.559" dur="3.761">default like temporal imagination so how</text><text start="1138.88" dur="2.56">can we expand</text><text start="1140.32" dur="3.359">um</text><text start="1141.44" dur="4.479">our time perceptions like getting this</text><text start="1143.679" dur="4.561">sense of deep time and long term long</text><text start="1145.919" dur="3.921">termism how can we</text><text start="1148.24" dur="3.12">uh you know do that like futures</text><text start="1149.84" dur="3.6">thinking work which can be like</text><text start="1151.36" dur="4.0">strategic foresight or like strategic</text><text start="1153.44" dur="5.2">futures where you actually like you know</text><text start="1155.36" dur="5.36">take um it&apos;s almost like expanding</text><text start="1158.64" dur="4.64">trends from the current day so you you</text><text start="1160.72" dur="5.199">pick like key trends or key things that</text><text start="1163.28" dur="4.0">are uh visible in the world today and</text><text start="1165.919" dur="2.88">then you iterate them out like what</text><text start="1167.28" dur="3.68">could that look like in five years and</text><text start="1168.799" dur="3.841">what if you take like 10 of those trends</text><text start="1170.96" dur="3.36">and you iterate all of them out into</text><text start="1172.64" dur="5.12">like 10 years into the future and then</text><text start="1174.32" dur="4.08">you almost like um cross-pollinate them</text><text start="1177.76" dur="3.039">like</text><text start="1178.4" dur="4.88">okay what if organizations you know can</text><text start="1180.799" dur="5.041">have uh</text><text start="1183.28" dur="4.16">rivers or like other illegal persons of</text><text start="1185.84" dur="3.6">nature on the board so that&apos;s like

super</text><text start="1221.039" dur="3.681">interesting and then there are many</text><text start="1222.559" dur="4.401">different like tools and approaches like</text><text start="1224.72" dur="4.8">narrative work or storytelling or</text><text start="1226.96" dur="4.16">working with artists and and bringing</text><text start="1229.52" dur="3.84">like i&apos;m super interested in the

dur="3.6">really that point about the second order</text><text start="1290.0" dur="2.159">um</text><text start="1291.12" dur="2.88">yeah like it&apos;s almost like the</text><text start="1292.159"

dur="4.079">of the impacts of those decisions or</text><text start="1298.96" dur="4.16">like yeah thinking in a more systematic</text><text start="1301.039" dur="3.76">way i think that&apos;s a great way yeah um</text><text start="1303.12" dur="3.919">summarizing it yeah it&apos;s a really</text><text start="1304.799" dur="3.601">interesting exercise because i know that</text><text

people and you</text><text start="1327.039" dur="3.52">imagine how you love them and then the</text><text start="1328.88" dur="4.159">whole exercise is to</text><text start="1330.559" dur="4.321">expand that circle outwards of your love</text><text start="1333.039" dur="4.081">and even include people that you have</text><text start="1334.88" dur="3.039">conflict with and it&apos;s sort of a useful</text><text start="1337.12" dur="2.72">tool</text><text start="1337.919" dur="3.361">i&apos;ve found on many different levels for</text><text start="1339.84" dur="3.52">creating

you&apos;ve ever</text><text start="1355.919" dur="4.0">played with with meta or lovingkindness</text><text start="1358.24" dur="3.2">meditation but that&apos;s been my experience</text><text start="1359.919" dur="3.281">that i&apos;m coming at this with and i found</text><text start="1361.44" dur="3.52">it to be an interesting exercise in</text><text start="1363.2" dur="4.0">expanding awareness</text><text start="1364.96" dur="3.839">yeah i think that&apos;s a great um great</text><text start="1367.2" dur="4.16">example and obviously buddhism has got</text><text start="1368.799" dur="6.0">like you know 2000 years of developing</text><text start="1371.36" dur="4.96">these psycho spiritual technologies um</text><text start="1374.799" dur="3.201">and and you know you can imagine like</text><text start="1376.32" dur="3.839">governance systems in the future where</text><text start="1378.0" dur="4.32">it&apos;s necessary to do like a meta</text><text start="1380.159" dur="4.161">exercise before entering yeah</text><text start="1382.32" dur="3.92">decision-making process yeah yeah and</text><text start="1384.32" dur="4.8">i&apos;m basically just saying that the</text><text start="1386.24" dur="4.559">imagination is is a really powerful tool</text><text start="1389.12" dur="3.84">to do that kind of perception shift and</text><text start="1390.799" dur="4.0">that if we can decide like what kind of</text><text start="1392.96" dur="4.079">world do we want to live in and i guess</text><text start="1394.799" dur="4.561">this touches on solar punk as

dur="3.04">actually account for that and i think</text><text start="1407.28" dur="3.6">it&apos;s interesting as well the way that</text><text start="1408.64" dur="4.399">you can start to imagine like you know a</text><text start="1410.88" dur="4.4">piece of land or a river owning itself</text><text start="1413.039" dur="3.921">like there&apos;s this intersection as well</text><text start="1415.28"

dur="4.639">agriculture and like there&apos;s also</text><text start="1725.679" dur="4.561">um yeah like regenerative like</text><text start="1728.159" dur="4.4">cooperative organizations or like all of</text><text start="1730.24" dur="4.96">these different ways that there are to</text><text start="1732.559" dur="6.161">join the region movement um and also</text><text start="1735.2" dur="5.28">like how convinced are you that web 3 is</text><text start="1738.72" dur="3.28">the solution to</text><text start="1740.48" dur="3.04">all of our problems that&apos;s my that&apos;s</text><text start="1742.0" dur="2.48">like that the question that&apos;s really on</text><text start="1743.52" dur="2.96">my mind</text><text start="1744.48" dur="3.919">yeah well it&apos;s fun to have someone as a</text><text start="1746.48" dur="3.679">guest on the podcast who flips the</text><text start="1748.399" dur="5.361">script back on me i&apos;ll take a swing at</text><text start="1750.159" dur="5.281">that um and that&apos;s it uh</text><text start="1753.76" dur="3.279">so i believe that there are many</text><text start="1755.44" dur="3.52">different forms of capital we just had</text><text start="1757.039" dur="3.601">greg landa on the on the podcast he</text><text start="1758.96" dur="4.719">talked about the eight forms of capital</text><text start="1760.64" dur="4.72">intellectual material living spiritual</text><text start="1763.679" dur="3.681">social</text><text start="1765.36" dur="4.72">wish i could name them all but i think i</text><text start="1767.36" dur="5.439">got close and and the the opportunity</text><text start="1770.08" dur="5.36">that i see is that web3 which is the</text><text start="1772.799" dur="5.201">internet of money is</text><text start="1775.44" dur="4.16">uh the biggest lever that we have or one</text><text start="1778.0" dur="4.159">of the biggest levers that we have</text><text start="1779.6" dur="4.48">because there&apos;s a two trillion dollar</text><text start="1782.159" dur="3.281">financial system and finance</text><text start="1784.08" dur="3.44">interoperates with all of those</text><text start="1785.44" dur="3.28">different types of capital and so what</text><text start="1787.52" dur="3.2">we&apos;re doing here with the green pill</text><text start="1788.72" dur="3.76">podcast for those of us who are skilled</text><text start="1790.72" dur="2.959">at reading between the lines is trying</text><text start="1792.48" dur="2.72">to create a shelling point for the</text><text start="1793.679" dur="4.0">people who want to use web3 to create</text><text start="1795.2" dur="3.839">more regenerative systems and i see it</text><text start="1797.679" dur="2.401">as one of the biggest leverage points in</text><text start="1799.039" dur="3.12">the world</text><text start="1800.08" dur="3.92">and this is maybe one of my beliefs that</text><text start="1802.159" dur="3.841">could be unpacked because i believe that</text><text start="1804.0" dur="4.24">the old financial system is not serving</text><text start="1806.0" dur="4.0">us in a world in which we&apos;ve got global</text><text start="1808.24" dur="3.84">coordination problems and we&apos;ve got</text><text start="1810.0" dur="4.96">global existential risk we need a global</text><text start="1812.08" dur="4.719">coordination substrate that actually can</text><text start="1814.96" dur="4.319">be that lever through which the more</text><text start="1816.799" dur="5.921">regenerative system is built and so i</text><text start="1819.279" dur="5.601">think for me it the tldr of me answering</text><text start="1822.72" dur="6.319">your question is that it&apos;s a yes and we</text><text start="1824.88" dur="6.56">need to build a financial system that uh</text><text start="1829.039" dur="5.041">is aware of the global commons of</text><text start="1831.44" dur="5.119">imagined worlds your words uh and is</text><text start="1834.08" dur="5.12">able to manage the externalities to</text><text start="1836.559" dur="4.081">uh future generations to</text><text start="1839.2" dur="4.64">all of these different</text><text start="1840.64" dur="4.8">different living systems and to humanity</text><text start="1843.84" dur="4.0">to expand out</text><text start="1845.44" dur="4.08">it&apos;s to expand out and able to to</text><text start="1847.84" dur="4.0">regenerate those things and i don&apos;t</text><text start="1849.52" dur="5.759">think the existing system is doing it so</text><text start="1851.84" dur="6.079">um i think that it&apos;s a yes and with with</text><text start="1855.279" dur="4.321">the other systems that that you that you</text><text start="1857.919" dur="3.841">mentioned is that fair</text><text start="1859.6" dur="3.679">yeah i i think that that is fair i think</text><text start="1861.76" dur="3.519">we&apos;re yeah what you&apos;re saying is like it</text><text start="1863.279" dur="4.0">currently it&apos;s the best</text><text start="1865.279" dur="4.161">lever that that you can see to do that</text><text start="1867.279" dur="3.76">on a global scale like that global level</text><text start="1869.44" dur="3.92">coordination and i guess</text><text start="1871.039" dur="4.48">yeah what i&apos;m hearing as well is like</text><text start="1873.36" dur="4.799">there might be folks especially like gen</text><text start="1875.519" dur="4.4">z folks like entering web 3 and getting</text><text start="1878.159" dur="3.841">like super excited and what the green</text><text start="1879.919" dur="4.161">pill is about it&apos;s like yes it&apos;s really</text><text start="1882.0" dur="3.519">exciting but it&apos;s not enough like on its</text><text start="1884.08" dur="3.599">own it&apos;s like what do we do what are we</text><text start="1885.519" dur="3.28">using it for which i love and i think is</text><text start="1887.679" dur="2.081">is really</text><text start="1888.799" dur="1.76">yeah</text><text start="1889.76" dur="2.72">great</text><text start="1890.559" dur="3.761">i&apos;ve seen an arc in this space where</text><text start="1892.48" dur="4.24">people get in the space because they</text><text start="1894.32" dur="4.079">want to get rich or they want to be able</text><text start="1896.72" dur="2.959">to quit their jobs and work on what they</text><text start="1898.399" dur="2.961">actually care about</text><text start="1899.679" dur="2.88">and</text><text start="1901.36" dur="2.48">you know the money is the first thing</text><text start="1902.559" dur="2.801">that captures them it brings them in the</text><text start="1903.84" dur="3.679">space but then they realize all the web</text><text start="1905.36" dur="4.319">3 values in the community and it&apos;s at</text><text start="1907.519" dur="3.921">that point like the phase two where</text><text start="1909.679" dur="3.441">i think dropping the green pill is the</text><text start="1911.44" dur="3.04">most poignant because they understand</text><text start="1913.12" dur="3.039">the tech and now they&apos;re like oh wait i</text><text start="1914.48" dur="3.6">can use this for creating a better world</text><text start="1916.159" dur="3.921">instead of having to escape the world</text><text start="1918.08" dur="3.199">and create my own little private utopia</text><text start="1920.08" dur="3.839">and so that&apos;s the point in which we&apos;re</text><text start="1921.279" dur="4.24">trying to hit hit the listeners and and</text><text start="1923.919" dur="3.36">again it&apos;s it&apos;s not my agenda that i&apos;m</text><text start="1925.519" dur="3.04">hitting with them with i&apos;m trying to</text><text start="1927.279" dur="2.801">create a</text><text start="1928.559" dur="2.72">channel for greater combinations of</text><text start="1930.08" dur="2.8">strength and intelligence to come</text><text start="1931.279" dur="2.801">together so what would you say to</text><text start="1932.88" dur="2.96">someone who&apos;s been through that phase</text><text start="1934.08" dur="3.28">two okay they&apos;ve been green pilled what</text><text start="1935.84" dur="3.679">are the causes that they should get</text><text start="1937.36" dur="4.08">involved with uh what is the imagination</text><text start="1939.519" dur="2.961">technology that they should hit up in</text><text start="1941.44" dur="2.8">order to</text><text start="1942.48" dur="3.36">uh in order to scale up to build this</text><text start="1944.24" dur="4.319">new world</text><text start="1945.84" dur="4.48">i love that i love that question so i&apos;m</text><text start="1948.559" dur="3.281">biased but i think you should you know</text><text start="1950.32" dur="3.92">you should join</text><text start="1951.84" dur="4.0">a imagination circle like a circle of</text><text start="1954.24" dur="3.439">people that you actually regularly do</text><text start="1955.84" dur="5.52">these collective imagination practices</text><text start="1957.679" dur="5.84">and um i am doing my very best to create</text><text start="1961.36" dur="4.0">yeah and with others like a team of</text><text start="1963.519" dur="4.561">others to create the resources and like</text><text start="1965.36" dur="4.319">open source blueprints and practices for</text><text start="1968.08" dur="5.199">folks to be able to do that stuff and i</text><text start="1969.679" dur="5.921">think like seeing you know dows and and</text><text start="1973.279" dur="4.161">communities and collectives bubble up</text><text start="1975.6" dur="3.6">where people are doing that imagination</text><text start="1977.44" dur="3.52">work together because imagination is a</text><text start="1979.2" dur="5.28">muscle and collective imagination is a</text><text start="1980.96" dur="6.16">muscle that we&apos;re not used to flexing um</text><text start="1984.48" dur="6.24">and then i think like the other piece is</text><text start="1987.12" dur="6.24">there is so much like exciting uh work</text><text start="1990.72" dur="5.12">to be done around like local</text><text start="1993.36" dur="4.319">um local regenerative action like</text><text start="1995.84" dur="3.679">connect to the place that you live or</text><text start="1997.679" dur="3.201">place you know fi wherever you care</text><text start="1999.519" dur="2.64">about like wherever you live wherever</text><text start="2000.88" dur="3.519">you&apos;re based like i think one of the</text><text start="2002.159" dur="4.88">dangers of the web 3 world is creating</text><text start="2004.399" dur="4.16">this like virtual layer of humans who go</text><text start="2007.039" dur="3.681">from like conference to conference and</text><text start="2008.559" dur="3.761">fly around the world and like i would</text><text start="2010.72" dur="4.4">you know i&apos;ve experienced that like back</text><text start="2012.32" dur="4.88">in 2018 that sense of like my community</text><text start="2015.12" dur="4.72">and my network is this like amorphous</text><text start="2017.2" dur="4.64">global virtual citizenship where we&apos;re</text><text start="2019.84" dur="3.92">like against nations and believe that</text><text start="2021.84" dur="3.28">we&apos;re going to create this like floating</text><text start="2023.76" dur="3.84">non-nation</text><text start="2025.12" dur="4.88">like citizenship situation i just think</text><text start="2027.6" dur="3.84">like we need to root into the places</text><text start="2030.0" dur="3.6">that you know that actually need that</text><text start="2031.44" dur="4.479">regeneration and you know for as many</text><text start="2033.6" dur="3.679">hours that you spend on like slack and</text><text start="2035.919" dur="3.6">discord in these communities and</text><text start="2037.279" dur="3.601">organizing like go and spend an hour out</text><text start="2039.519" dur="4.0">out on the land and like do that</text><text start="2040.88" dur="4.72">regeneration like learn about also like</text><text start="2043.519" dur="4.0">where where um you know learn about your</text><text start="2045.6" dur="3.84">local csa like community supported</text><text start="2047.519" dur="4.801">agriculture like there are so many</text><text start="2049.44" dur="5.439">technologies and and like organizing</text><text start="2052.32" dur="5.039">patterns and like cooperatives and all</text><text start="2054.879" dur="4.161">these ways that people like us have been</text><text start="2057.359" dur="3.841">trying to create a better world like</text><text start="2059.04" dur="4.4">before the age of the internet before</text><text start="2061.2" dur="4.159">web 3 like it&apos;s all happening and there</text><text start="2063.44" dur="3.6">are all these different ways of being</text><text start="2065.359" dur="3.441">involved so i think it&apos;s like as you say</text><text start="2067.04" dur="3.599">yes and like</text><text start="2068.8" dur="3.76">i think it&apos;s super exciting like these</text><text start="2070.639" dur="3.921">you know the potential of these</text><text start="2072.56" dur="4.24">currencies and and like taos and</text><text start="2074.56" dur="4.48">different ways of coordinating globally</text><text start="2076.8" dur="3.839">but how do we balance that out with the</text><text start="2079.04" dur="2.96">local as well</text><text start="2080.639" dur="3.2">um i think that&apos;s really key and</text><text start="2082.0" dur="4.639">actually i&apos;m like part of a couple</text><text start="2083.839" dur="4.641">projects like a project with reiki uh</text><text start="2086.639" dur="4.24">cordon from seeds where we&apos;re creating</text><text start="2088.48" dur="5.679">what&apos;s called a regenerator a regen</text><text start="2090.879" dur="6.48">civics incubator like an incubator for</text><text start="2094.159" dur="5.68">um local community eco village</text><text start="2097.359" dur="5.441">uh like local regen civics projects that</text><text start="2099.839" dur="5.921">want to like upscale and build capacity</text><text start="2102.8" dur="5.039">to be able to multiply and and create</text><text start="2105.76" dur="6.079">these like blueprints and tools and</text><text start="2107.839" dur="6.0">education platform um capacities to to</text><text start="2111.839" dur="3.441">yeah to multiply around the world so i</text><text start="2113.839" dur="3.76">think we just need to</text><text start="2115.28" dur="4.88">balance out that global virtual layer</text><text start="2117.599" dur="6.321">with the local regenerative</text><text start="2120.16" dur="3.76">community building layer i would say</text><text start="2124.079" dur="3.28">yeah</text><text start="2124.88" dur="4.56">i think that that&apos;s that&apos;s a a really</text><text start="2127.359" dur="4.561">great way of staying grounded is being</text><text start="2129.44" dur="4.399">involved in your local community whereas</text><text start="2131.92" dur="3.6">you know there&apos;s so much global sort of</text><text start="2133.839" dur="2.881">disembodied game theory that happens</text><text start="2135.52" dur="3.36">with the</text><text start="2136.72" dur="4.08">in the global system and sometimes it&apos;s</text><text start="2138.88" dur="4.479">just nice to get outside and get in the</text><text start="2140.8" dur="4.88">sun and work in your local community</text><text start="2143.359" dur="4.0">uh so so i love that</text><text start="2145.68" dur="4.159">um</text><text start="2147.359" dur="3.76">i i guess you know i&apos;m wondering uh</text><text start="2149.839" dur="2.561">there&apos;s a there&apos;s a couple things in my</text><text start="2151.119" dur="3.681">notes here that they&apos;re just kind of</text><text start="2152.4" dur="5.36">like memes that stuck out at me as i was</text><text start="2154.8" dur="5.039">doing my research on you uh a couple a</text><text start="2157.76" dur="4.64">couple things that i wrote down here is</text><text start="2159.839" dur="3.601">uh people could tool up as as they wake</text><text start="2162.4" dur="3.679">up</text><text start="2163.44" dur="5.919">uh basically building uh</text><text start="2166.079" dur="5.441">global commons of imagined worlds</text><text start="2169.359" dur="4.641">a toolkit of collective imagination i&apos;m</text><text start="2171.52" dur="4.079">curious you know as i rattle off these</text><text start="2174.0" dur="3.44">memes to you what kind of sticks out to</text><text start="2175.599" dur="3.921">you as as the most important next thing</text><text start="2177.44" dur="3.919">to discuss</text><text start="2179.52" dur="3.599">um</text><text start="2181.359" dur="3.841">i think we&apos;ve already covered a lot of</text><text start="2183.119" dur="3.841">wake up wake up to tula those are like</text><text start="2185.2" dur="3.919">the two yeah like that&apos;s what i&apos;m</text><text start="2186.96" dur="3.68">working on at the moment i&apos;m building an</text><text start="2189.119" dur="3.521">organization that is going to really</text><text start="2190.64" dur="4.479">focus on those two buckets so like moral</text><text start="2192.64" dur="3.84">imaginations exist as its design and</text><text start="2195.119" dur="4.0">research studio but there&apos;s an</text><text start="2196.48" dur="4.4">organization now that will be focusing</text><text start="2199.119" dur="4.24">on that like scaling of the collective</text><text start="2200.88" dur="3.84">imagining and like the collectively</text><text start="2203.359" dur="3.76">waking up and the tooling up i think we</text><text start="2204.72" dur="4.24">kind of covered that um and if anyone&apos;s</text><text start="2207.119" dur="4.641">interested like please hit me up on</text><text start="2208.96" dur="4.159">twitter solarpunkgirl um so the</text><text start="2211.76" dur="3.68">underscore girl</text><text start="2213.119" dur="5.441">and yeah i mean we&apos;ve covered</text><text start="2215.44" dur="5.12">imagination commons imagination toolkit</text><text start="2218.56" dur="3.84">um i mean what what kind of questions do</text><text start="2220.56" dur="3.6">you have like i guess this is</text><text start="2222.4" dur="3.84">yeah is this imagination stuff like</text><text start="2224.16" dur="4.959">totally new are you like you know is</text><text start="2226.24" dur="4.72">this have you already been um</text><text start="2229.119" dur="4.081">i mean everybody obviously everybody is</text><text start="2230.96" dur="5.04">participating and imagining and if you</text><text start="2233.2" dur="4.56">read sci-fi or like yeah like creative</text><text start="2236.0" dur="3.44">there are many creative ways of being</text><text start="2237.76" dur="2.88">part of like a global imagination</text><text start="2239.44" dur="4.32">movement but</text><text start="2240.64" dur="6.4">um yeah what stands out to you</text><text start="2243.76" dur="4.96">yeah well i i do think that</text><text start="2247.04" dur="3.6">one of the things that i think that is</text><text start="2248.72" dur="4.879">so interesting about what you&apos;re doing</text><text start="2250.64" dur="4.16">is that it&apos;s sort of imagining</text><text start="2253.599" dur="2.961">new world i almost i almost feel like</text><text start="2254.8" dur="3.2">we&apos;re venturing out into the fog of war</text><text start="2256.56" dur="4.88">and i don&apos;t know what&apos;s out there until</text><text start="2258.0" dur="3.44">i kind of stumble upon it so</text><text start="2261.68" dur="3.12">kind of stumbling around in the darkness</text><text start="2263.2" dur="3.6">here but but maybe you could light my</text><text start="2264.8" dur="3.68">path and tell me</text><text start="2266.8" dur="4.0">what are the</text><text start="2268.48" dur="5.28">the neatest ideas that you&apos;ve landed</text><text start="2270.8" dur="4.72">upon about what the world could be that</text><text start="2273.76" dur="4.4">that people may not be aware of like i&apos;m</text><text start="2275.52" dur="5.12">looking for sort of tangible examples of</text><text start="2278.16" dur="3.76">of what the world could be that that</text><text start="2280.64" dur="3.36">sort of</text><text start="2281.92" dur="3.28">because they&apos;re visceral and they&apos;re</text><text start="2284.0" dur="3.68">they&apos;re examples of what you&apos;ve</text><text start="2285.2" dur="4.24">discovered might sort of uh wet people&apos;s</text><text start="2287.68" dur="4.08">appetites to get into imagination</text><text start="2289.44" dur="4.0">technology so what what are the what are</text><text start="2291.76" dur="4.4">sort of the neatest imaginations that</text><text start="2293.44" dur="4.639">you&apos;ve come up with in your time working</text><text start="2296.16" dur="3.84">on this</text><text start="2298.079" dur="3.841">interesting um</text><text start="2300.0" dur="4.48">i i&apos;m particularly interested in this</text><text start="2301.92" dur="4.159">kind of interspecies justice like i</text><text start="2304.48" dur="3.44">think it&apos;s always fascinating when</text><text start="2306.079" dur="4.481">people come up with like you know some</text><text start="2307.92" dur="4.72">really wacky wacky stuff around like a</text><text start="2310.56" dur="4.08">guild of pigeons who you know like</text><text start="2312.64" dur="4.479">revolt against like all of the like</text><text start="2314.64" dur="4.719">spikes that exist on our buildings that</text><text start="2317.119" dur="4.0">like you know kill pigeons or you know</text><text start="2319.359" dur="4.0">like some of it is pretty comical but i</text><text start="2321.119" dur="4.321">think like that&apos;s the point it&apos;s like to</text><text start="2323.359" dur="4.561">to be able to expand out that&apos;s that</text><text start="2325.44" dur="4.48">even just that perspective of like who</text><text start="2327.92" dur="4.4">has rights who has power who can who can</text><text start="2329.92" dur="4.08">make decisions i i always find that like</text><text start="2332.32" dur="4.24">super inspiring</text><text start="2334.0" dur="4.0">um because it&apos;s just so far from from</text><text start="2336.56" dur="4.0">where we&apos;re at now like we&apos;re existing</text><text start="2338.0" dur="4.56">in this like totally anthropomorphic</text><text start="2340.56" dur="4.24">world where actually like we&apos;ve spent</text><text start="2342.56" dur="3.84">thousands of years like killing off any</text><text start="2344.8" dur="4.319">species that doesn&apos;t either like</text><text start="2346.4" dur="4.959">directly feed us or directly feed the</text><text start="2349.119" dur="3.601">species that feed us and it&apos;s like kind</text><text start="2351.359" dur="3.76">of extraordinary when you think about it</text><text start="2352.72" dur="5.04">like i think in 100 years like i i&apos;m</text><text start="2355.119" dur="4.48">super interested in how we&apos;ll view the</text><text start="2357.76" dur="3.28">kind of species violence that we&apos;re</text><text start="2359.599" dur="4.401">we&apos;re doing right now like would it be</text><text start="2361.04" dur="5.12">the equivalent of like slavery 100 years</text><text start="2364.0" dur="3.52">ago so like thinking about</text><text start="2366.16" dur="2.88">the things that we look back to a</text><text start="2367.52" dur="3.36">hundred years ago and think like wow</text><text start="2369.04" dur="3.68">that is like so wrong like how could we</text><text start="2370.88" dur="3.6">ever do that what&apos;s the equivalent of</text><text start="2372.72" dur="4.16">those things now like i think that&apos;s a</text><text start="2374.48" dur="4.8">very interesting exercise to go through</text><text start="2376.88" dur="2.4">um</text><text start="2379.68" dur="3.679">like a lot of vegans will like will also</text><text start="2381.76" dur="3.599">say this like we&apos;ll look back on like</text><text start="2383.359" dur="4.72">the the violence against</text><text start="2385.359" dur="4.801">um against cows and like factory farming</text><text start="2388.079" dur="3.52">and yeah it&apos;s just it&apos;s seeing those</text><text start="2390.16" dur="3.36">things that are like right in front of</text><text start="2391.599" dur="3.681">our eyes but we&apos;ve just never seen it in</text><text start="2393.52" dur="3.28">that way i think that&apos;s the really</text><text start="2395.28" dur="3.12">interesting thing and i think i think a</text><text start="2396.8" dur="3.52">really key turning point was when i</text><text start="2398.4" dur="3.76">realized that i think this this is a</text><text start="2400.32" dur="4.08">very um</text><text start="2402.16" dur="4.88">just key pattern that that we have</text><text start="2404.4" dur="5.04">basically as human beings like attempted</text><text start="2407.04" dur="3.92">to destroy like every single species</text><text start="2409.44" dur="4.72">plant species</text><text start="2410.96" dur="5.359">um that doesn&apos;t directly feed our food</text><text start="2414.16" dur="4.08">so like grass like we&apos;ve</text><text start="2416.319" dur="4.401">basically like plastered the whole globe</text><text start="2418.24" dur="4.079">in grass because that&apos;s what our food</text><text start="2420.72" dur="3.68">eats and it&apos;s like that just having that</text><text start="2422.319" dur="5.04">perspective of like wow like it really</text><text start="2424.4" dur="4.08">shifts the sense of like human being&apos;s</text><text start="2427.359" dur="3.361">um</text><text start="2428.48" dur="3.92">role and and like what what kind of role</text><text start="2430.72" dur="3.76">and what kind of actor we we have like</text><text start="2432.4" dur="5.12">decided to be on this planet</text><text start="2434.48" dur="6.08">um going directly against like nature&apos;s</text><text start="2437.52" dur="5.52">most core um resilience pattern which is</text><text start="2440.56" dur="4.4">diversity like diversity and pluralism</text><text start="2443.04" dur="3.76">like we&apos;ve just completely</text><text start="2444.96" dur="3.44">uh you know it&apos;s kind of like the the</text><text start="2446.8" dur="3.68">equivalent of like the laws of physics</text><text start="2448.4" dur="4.48">but in terms of like nature and survival</text><text start="2450.48" dur="4.32">and like that&apos;s right part of why we&apos;re</text><text start="2452.88" dur="3.439">facing you know existential risk and</text><text start="2454.8" dur="4.08">like massive species destruction so i</text><text start="2456.319" dur="4.481">think like one that&apos;s been like a huge</text><text start="2458.88" dur="4.16">realization that&apos;s opened up to me from</text><text start="2460.8" dur="4.24">the imagination work so</text><text start="2463.04" dur="4.079">i think rather than like</text><text start="2465.04" dur="3.76">really specific worlds of the future</text><text start="2467.119" dur="3.121">like oh it&apos;ll you know you can come up</text><text start="2468.8" dur="3.76">with like all sorts of really like</text><text start="2470.24" dur="3.52">fantastical um</text><text start="2472.56" dur="3.6">yeah</text><text start="2473.76" dur="4.48">technology or like the way that we&apos;ll be</text><text start="2476.16" dur="3.919">work like working with data or like very</text><text start="2478.24" dur="3.52">dystopian futures like it&apos;s not just</text><text start="2480.079" dur="2.961">utopian i think a lot of this imagining</text><text start="2481.76" dur="2.72">work like comes up with like very</text><text start="2483.04" dur="3.52">dystopian</text><text start="2484.48" dur="4.56">uh situations like i think the really</text><text start="2486.56" dur="4.16">interesting thing is like what they open</text><text start="2489.04" dur="4.079">up in terms of like the way we see the</text><text start="2490.72" dur="4.0">world today like that&apos;s that&apos;s the</text><text start="2493.119" dur="3.601">interesting thing for me</text><text start="2494.72" dur="3.92">yeah that&apos;s so interesting i think that</text><text start="2496.72" dur="4.16">there&apos;s probably so many possible worlds</text><text start="2498.64" dur="4.08">out there both dystopian and utopian</text><text start="2500.88" dur="3.439">fragile and anti-fragile that can be</text><text start="2502.72" dur="2.96">imagined when you have imagination</text><text start="2504.319" dur="2.881">technology</text><text start="2505.68" dur="2.8">um is there anything</text><text start="2507.2" dur="2.8">oh good</text><text start="2508.48" dur="3.44">i was just going to add that like also</text><text start="2510.0" dur="3.04">there&apos;s many you know it also opens your</text><text start="2511.92" dur="3.6">eyes to the fact that there are many</text><text start="2513.04" dur="4.319">worlds existing today which is obvious</text><text start="2515.52" dur="4.48">like obvious to some people but really</text><text start="2517.359" dur="5.041">realizing that um you know we live in a</text><text start="2520.0" dur="4.0">world of many worlds like we think we</text><text start="2522.4" dur="3.919">think that there&apos;s just one world but</text><text start="2524.0" dur="3.92">actually like you know as william gibson</text><text start="2526.319" dur="3.52">says like you know the</text><text start="2527.92" dur="3.76">or it&apos;s like a play on that on the</text><text start="2529.839" dur="3.28">william gibson quote like the apocalypse</text><text start="2531.68" dur="3.04">is already here it&apos;s just not evenly</text><text start="2533.119" dur="3.921">distributed so when we say like oh my</text><text start="2534.72" dur="3.84">god apocalypse is coming like loads of</text><text start="2537.04" dur="3.36">people in the world today would say like</text><text start="2538.56" dur="3.92">oh that&apos;s been my reality for like the</text><text start="2540.4" dur="4.24">last 50 years but</text><text start="2542.48" dur="4.08">yeah that&apos;s what i was gonna add</text><text start="2544.64" dur="4.88">wow um is there anything that i didn&apos;t</text><text start="2546.56" dur="4.4">ask that you want to tell the audience</text><text start="2549.52" dur="3.52">before we wrap up i think one of the</text><text start="2550.96" dur="5.52">ways that we met was when i tweeted</text><text start="2553.04" dur="6.24">recently about running a web three</text><text start="2556.48" dur="5.92">um like a course on web3 and crypto for</text><text start="2559.28" dur="4.88">regen and culture folks like so that</text><text start="2562.4" dur="3.12">might yeah because i i live in this like</text><text start="2564.16" dur="2.959">interesting intersection of different</text><text start="2565.52" dur="3.76">networks where like one half of my</text><text start="2567.119" dur="3.681">twitter is like web three crypto people</text><text start="2569.28" dur="4.079">and the other half is like region</text><text start="2570.8" dur="4.24">culture people who have like no overlap</text><text start="2573.359" dur="4.321">with the other half so it feels like</text><text start="2575.04" dur="5.12">very schizophrenic so i&apos;m i&apos;m super</text><text start="2577.68" dur="4.32">excited about that developing a course</text><text start="2580.16" dur="3.919">that really really is for the people who</text><text start="2582.0" dur="3.68">have like zero experience zero</text><text start="2584.079" dur="4.641">understanding of web 3 and crypto</text><text start="2585.68" dur="5.919">because i i often get um approached by</text><text start="2588.72" dur="4.399">by people in in my network on that regen</text><text start="2591.599" dur="3.76">side where they&apos;re just like</text><text start="2593.119" dur="4.48">i get this sense that crypto is like</text><text start="2595.359" dur="4.321">really bad for the planet but like i</text><text start="2597.599" dur="3.841">don&apos;t fully like have the understanding</text><text start="2599.68" dur="3.6">of all of it and like dows and what are</text><text start="2601.44" dur="3.919">these things and i just think like even</text><text start="2603.28" dur="4.72">if the sole purpose of doing you know</text><text start="2605.359" dur="5.121">like running courses in education for</text><text start="2608.0" dur="4.0">folks in that in that sphere on web 3</text><text start="2610.48" dur="3.359">and crypto is just so that they can have</text><text start="2612.0" dur="3.52">better criticisms i feel like that&apos;s</text><text start="2613.839" dur="3.441">really good for us in the web 3 space</text><text start="2615.52" dur="3.2">because then you can actually have the</text><text start="2617.28" dur="4.0">critical conversations and like</text><text start="2618.72" dur="5.2">recognize as well that web 3 is like so</text><text start="2621.28" dur="4.24">in its infancy like right now</text><text start="2623.92" dur="3.439">like yeah i really believe that we&apos;re</text><text start="2625.52" dur="3.68">like right at the very beginning and</text><text start="2627.359" dur="4.161">like you know a lot of people will say</text><text start="2629.2" dur="4.0">like yeah like web 3 is here or like</text><text start="2631.52" dur="3.2">it&apos;s all it&apos;s all here now like i really</text><text start="2633.2" dur="2.879">think like a lot of it doesn&apos;t even</text><text start="2634.72" dur="3.04">fully work like we&apos;re just at the</text><text start="2636.079" dur="3.961">beginning</text><text start="2637.76" dur="5.04">so we really need like the cultural like</text><text start="2640.04" dur="4.12">sociologists like political science you</text><text start="2642.8" dur="2.96">know democracy</text><text start="2644.16" dur="3.439">activists like all of those folks who&apos;ve</text><text start="2645.76" dur="3.2">got all that experience like we need</text><text start="2647.599" dur="2.801">them in the space actually like</text><text start="2648.96" dur="3.52">understanding what</text><text start="2650.4" dur="4.48">what yeah the technicals the</text><text start="2652.48" dur="4.08">technicalities like all of that stuff so</text><text start="2654.88" dur="3.12">that we can actually like develop</text><text start="2656.56" dur="3.36">something that is better even if it&apos;s</text><text start="2658.0" dur="3.68">like a lot of criticism</text><text start="2659.92" dur="4.32">right yeah i just feel like there&apos;s this</text><text start="2661.68" dur="3.84">real when our powers combine moment with</text><text start="2664.24" dur="3.359">regen</text><text start="2665.52" dur="4.16">circles that you traffic in in the web 3</text><text start="2667.599" dur="4.321">circles that maybe this the audience of</text><text start="2669.68" dur="3.76">this podcast are a little bit more</text><text start="2671.92" dur="4.399">involved in and i&apos;m curious to see how</text><text start="2673.44" dur="4.96">those things clash but also what kind of</text><text start="2676.319" dur="4.961">synergies are created between those two</text><text start="2678.4" dur="4.16">communities as as we push forward and</text><text start="2681.28" dur="3.36">um i think you&apos;re really at the</text><text start="2682.56" dur="4.559">epicenter of both of those things</text><text start="2684.64" dur="4.16">so if people in in our audience want to</text><text start="2687.119" dur="2.641">get involved in imagination technology</text><text start="2688.8" dur="3.12">or any of the work that they&apos;re doing</text><text start="2689.76" dur="4.559">where can
