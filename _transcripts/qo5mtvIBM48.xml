wrote together this</text><text start="247.36" dur="5.04">episode um can you tell me what is an</text><text start="249.92" dur="4.959">impact owl yeah impact dials are mainly</text><text start="252.4" dur="5.2">just any doubt that&apos;s creating positive</text><text start="254.879" dur="4.88">personalities to the world and any doubt</text><text start="257.6" dur="4.479">that&apos;s actually leveraging what three</text><text start="259.759" dur="4.241">the tooling mechanisms but also just</text><text start="262.079" dur="3.68">like the mental models and shifts and</text><text start="264.0" dur="3.919">mindsets to</text><text start="265.759" dur="4.88">create a positive impact so leveraging</text><text start="267.919" dur="4.0">that for good got it so when you say</text><text start="270.639" dur="2.801">positive impact are you talking about</text><text start="271.919" dur="4.0">like financial impact are there other</text><text start="273.44" dur="5.759">types of impact that uh an impact out</text><text start="275.919" dur="5.681">can have also no no it&apos;s i think like</text><text start="279.199" dur="4.401">any layer of impact like for example for</text><text start="281.6" dur="4.24">me it&apos;s never been much about financial</text><text start="283.6" dur="5.12">impact it&apos;s more about like well yes</text><text start="285.84" dur="5.84">economic development but also like</text><text start="288.72" dur="6.56">inter regeneration like individual</text><text start="291.68" dur="6.0">growth um experiential spiritual natural</text><text start="295.28" dur="5.12">impact so anything that is like more</text><text start="297.68" dur="5.44">holistic and touching every point of</text><text start="300.4" dur="4.4">area of life and like how we operate as</text><text start="303.12" dur="3.76">a society and how we operate as</text><text start="304.8" dur="3.76">different cultures together as well got</text><text start="306.88" dur="3.12">it what got you into this work like how</text><text start="308.56" dur="3.28">did you get green-pilled what you what</text><text start="310.0" dur="2.88">got you into public goods uh well</text><text start="311.84" dur="3.6">honestly</text><text start="312.88" dur="4.56">that was my starting point so</text><text start="315.44" dur="4.0">previously i&apos;ve like i&apos;m from peru so</text><text start="317.44" dur="4.0">i&apos;ve always been like around a lot of</text><text start="319.44" dur="4.56">both party but also around a lot of</text><text start="321.44" dur="5.039">nature so my work has always been around</text><text start="324.0" dur="4.8">like positive impact probably goods um</text><text start="326.479" dur="4.961">first like volunteering making houses</text><text start="328.8" dur="4.64">their cases in the muslims then like</text><text start="331.44" dur="4.16">more of an educational nonprofit i</text><text start="333.44" dur="5.12">needed both and then it has always been</text><text start="335.6" dur="4.96">like more of um journey of like oh where</text><text start="338.56" dur="4.72">can i achieve more impact in the world</text><text start="340.56" dur="4.32">or achieve with others around me more</text><text start="343.28" dur="3.6">change um</text><text start="344.88" dur="4.48">towards those communities that i see in</text><text start="346.88" dur="4.56">peru and that&apos;s what led me more to like</text><text start="349.36" dur="3.679">the us searching for that like</text><text start="351.44" dur="4.56">entrepreneurial</text><text start="353.039" dur="4.081">more like yeah entrepreneurial and</text><text start="356.0" dur="3.759">just</text><text start="357.12" dur="4.88">faster quicker more technological</text><text start="359.759" dur="4.641">advances to achieve change and that&apos;s</text><text start="362.0" dur="4.639">where i started also working at 50 years</text><text start="364.4" dur="4.88">like helping founders solving world&apos;s</text><text start="366.639" dur="4.321">problems with technology and like</text><text start="369.28" dur="4.32">learning from that aspect because i was</text><text start="370.96" dur="5.04">kind of like oh non-profits that i used</text><text start="373.6" dur="4.64">to lead are very good and they have a</text><text start="376.0" dur="4.96">lot of good meaning people but sometimes</text><text start="378.24" dur="4.64">they&apos;re not as effective and slower so i</text><text start="380.96" dur="4.799">wanted to see the other side of things</text><text start="382.88" dur="5.28">and then through 50 years i kind of</text><text start="385.759" dur="4.961">discovered what three and</text><text start="388.16" dur="5.2">i really didn&apos;t dive into it</text><text start="390.72" dur="4.479">at first because i was only hearing like</text><text start="393.36" dur="4.08">all my friends and other people around</text><text start="395.199" dur="3.84">me like saying like oh the metaverse</text><text start="397.44" dur="3.84">gaming stuff like that i don&apos;t even</text><text start="399.039" dur="5.121">watch netflix so i was like oh why would</text><text start="401.28" dur="5.039">i get into this um and then i somehow</text><text start="404.16" dur="5.36">stumbled upon like these concepts of</text><text start="406.319" dur="5.201">like oh how can we embed our values into</text><text start="409.52" dur="3.679">our economic systems or</text><text start="411.52" dur="3.6">how do we actually create instead of</text><text start="413.199" dur="3.681">like creating products or services we&apos;re</text><text start="415.12" dur="4.32">actually re-engineering like</text><text start="416.88" dur="5.039">coordination designs or like the</text><text start="419.44" dur="5.52">railroads that will lead us to create</text><text start="421.919" dur="4.801">positive actions just naturally so i was</text><text start="424.96" dur="3.04">like super super excited about that</text><text start="426.72" dur="3.599">because we could kind of like</text><text start="428.0" dur="5.68">re-engineer how we coordinate as humans</text><text start="430.319" dur="5.841">and just like um value what is important</text><text start="433.68" dur="5.28">to us as like in the planner and also as</text><text start="436.16" dur="4.72">human beings right what i think is so</text><text start="438.96" dur="3.359">cool about your story is that you know</text><text start="440.88" dur="3.28">as a young person looking to have</text><text start="442.319" dur="3.681">positive impact you kind of</text><text start="444.16" dur="3.68">you kind of saw that</text><text start="446.0" dur="3.36">there was this whole world of charities</text><text start="447.84" dur="4.56">that you could go into and then there</text><text start="449.36" dur="5.44">was like web 3 impact and you chose to</text><text start="452.4" dur="4.639">move a little bit more towards the web</text><text start="454.8" dur="4.48">web 3 side of things like was there like</text><text start="457.039" dur="3.44">an instinct there or was there something</text><text start="459.28" dur="3.68">that you discovered that pushed you in</text><text start="460.479" dur="4.641">that direction yes it was as soon as i</text><text start="462.96" dur="4.639">read i think it was a paper by seats</text><text start="465.12" dur="6.72">saying how our economy is usually backed</text><text start="467.599" dur="6.241">by extractive methods and by oil gas and</text><text start="471.84" dur="4.479">all those industries and how we could</text><text start="473.84" dur="4.72">actually use these occurrences to</text><text start="476.319" dur="4.241">engineer digital economies that are</text><text start="478.56" dur="4.56">actually backed by nature and like as</text><text start="480.56" dur="4.639">the ecology grows the economy grows and</text><text start="483.12" dur="4.24">those concepts actually were so</text><text start="485.199" dur="5.28">interesting to me and to discover and</text><text start="487.36" dur="5.279">also the second leap into discovering</text><text start="490.479" dur="4.881">even more of what three was actually the</text><text start="492.639" dur="5.521">people so i&apos;ve always been very much</text><text start="495.36" dur="4.64">into not only impacts like business</text><text start="498.16" dur="4.879">entrepreneurship but also a lot into</text><text start="500.0" dur="5.12">health philosophy psychology like</text><text start="503.039" dur="3.921">fasting different technologies that are</text><text start="505.12" dur="3.6">also like technologies but in a</text><text start="506.96" dur="4.0">different way like how we eat how we</text><text start="508.72" dur="4.96">behave the sports we do and different</text><text start="510.96" dur="5.68">things and i&apos;ve always kind of like kept</text><text start="513.68" dur="4.96">separated both sides of me and now as i</text><text start="516.64" dur="4.56">go into a three like it&apos;s kind of like a</text><text start="518.64" dur="4.0">mesh of arts culture</text><text start="521.2" dur="3.84">um like</text><text start="522.64" dur="4.48">philosophy system thinkers and a lot of</text><text start="525.04" dur="4.4">people who are actually thinking deeply</text><text start="527.12" dur="4.48">in systems like not only just like</text><text start="529.44" dur="4.56">solving the most obvious symptoms but i</text><text start="531.6" dur="4.4">rather trying to find out like the</text><text start="534.0" dur="3.68">underlying issues that are causing</text><text start="536.0" dur="4.08">everything like all the problems in the</text><text start="537.68" dur="4.96">first place and i think that that</text><text start="540.08" dur="4.72">excited me like very much because i</text><text start="542.64" dur="6.0">could kind of like bring my whole self</text><text start="544.8" dur="6.64">to the table and like those solutions</text><text start="548.64" dur="4.96">that incorporate every curiosity i have</text><text start="551.44" dur="4.16">and do so with people who also have like</text><text start="553.6" dur="3.679">from very very different experiences</text><text start="555.6" dur="4.4">backgrounds and curiosity that also</text><text start="557.279" dur="5.841">bring all aspects of human life into the</text><text start="560.0" dur="4.32">table so that greenfield me like</text><text start="563.12" dur="3.6">twice</text><text start="564.32" dur="5.36">okay amazing yeah i mean i think that</text><text start="566.72" dur="4.32">you know um</text><text start="569.68" dur="4.08">it&apos;s kind of nice to hear the background</text><text start="571.04" dur="4.64">of of of what you&apos;ve been up to and and</text><text start="573.76" dur="4.16">i think that like the way our paths meet</text><text start="575.68" dur="3.92">is that in january when i was writing</text><text start="577.92" dur="4.16">this green pill book about how crypto</text><text start="579.6" dur="5.52">could regenerate the world we started to</text><text start="582.08" dur="5.52">talk about how impact owls were the</text><text start="585.12" dur="4.32">atomic building block of this movement</text><text start="587.6" dur="4.799">so you have an impact dial that creates</text><text start="589.44" dur="5.92">a positive externality for the world and</text><text start="592.399" dur="4.721">um around that time</text><text start="595.36" dur="5.12">i kept getting challenged like okay</text><text start="597.12" dur="5.52">kevin this is all nice in theory but</text><text start="600.48" dur="3.76">is are any projects actually doing this</text><text start="602.64" dur="3.199">um are there any projects that are</text><text start="604.24" dur="3.68">actually truly having impact these days</text><text start="605.839" dur="5.041">and then and um i think that was around</text><text start="607.92" dur="5.52">the time that you and i met uh i think</text><text start="610.88" dur="4.48">around like east denver and and i was</text><text start="613.44" dur="3.839">like man i kind of like feel like we</text><text start="615.36" dur="4.159">should do impact out cartography like we</text><text start="617.279" dur="4.56">should figure out what&apos;s out there and</text><text start="619.519" dur="5.201">like create a database of uh</text><text start="621.839" dur="4.321">of of impact dials so that i can you</text><text start="624.72" dur="3.52">know have an exhaustive resource to</text><text start="626.16" dur="3.28">answer that question of okay is green</text><text start="628.24" dur="2.8">pilling actually happening are we</text><text start="629.44" dur="3.6">actually creating uh</text><text start="631.04" dur="3.68">are we actually uh</text><text start="633.04" dur="3.44">creating positive impact for the world</text><text start="634.72" dur="5.04">in this space and so that&apos;s how you and</text><text start="636.48" dur="5.84">i got connected and uh we put together</text><text start="639.76" dur="4.96">an impact-dell book and a notion</text><text start="642.32" dur="5.04">database that is a registry of different</text><text start="644.72" dur="4.799">impact owls so can you tell me uh about</text><text start="647.36" dur="4.88">that um how many impact owls are in the</text><text start="649.519" dur="3.601">registry and tell me about tell me about</text><text start="652.24" dur="2.719">the book</text><text start="653.12" dur="4.08">yeah definitely it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of funny</text><text start="654.959" dur="4.32">because like at the time i was like i</text><text start="657.2" dur="6.0">had no idea i had never met you right so</text><text start="659.279" dur="6.401">it was very much of um oh like</text><text start="663.2" dur="5.52">i&apos;m i was i started building this list</text><text start="665.68" dur="5.279">of projects back in december like with</text><text start="668.72" dur="4.239">50 years we were trying to see do we</text><text start="670.959" dur="3.761">want to get involved with three or not</text><text start="672.959" dur="2.961">like it&apos;s like what are the projects</text><text start="674.72" dur="3.28">that are actually making something</text><text start="675.92" dur="4.159">meaningful because like 50 years as a</text><text start="678.0" dur="4.72">background is mostly just like investing</text><text start="680.079" dur="4.961">in f supporting founders like solving</text><text start="682.72" dur="4.16">problems with good impact so it was oh</text><text start="685.04" dur="4.08">what are the projects out there that are</text><text start="686.88" dur="4.639">actually achieving uh positive impact</text><text start="689.12" dur="4.56">and i was mapping them like for that</text><text start="691.519" dur="5.041">purpose kind of thing to like mentally</text><text start="693.68" dur="5.12">understand like like how are is crypto</text><text start="696.56" dur="3.839">or three being used in different ways</text><text start="698.8" dur="4.64">and it was so funny that you actually</text><text start="700.399" dur="5.041">made the call for the cartographers and</text><text start="703.44" dur="4.24">i had my notion with like a hundred</text><text start="705.44" dur="4.399">projects and the descriptions and</text><text start="707.68" dur="4.24">i was like oh like i have all this</text><text start="709.839" dur="4.321">information i have always data and i was</text><text start="711.92" dur="3.84">already a huge fan of git coin like it</text><text start="714.16" dur="3.76">was kind of like one of the main</text><text start="715.76" dur="4.4">organizations that greenfield me with</text><text start="717.92" dur="4.64">the grants and seeing how people were</text><text start="720.16" dur="4.32">actually excited about like donating to</text><text start="722.56" dur="3.839">projects and riding the community to</text><text start="724.48" dur="4.64">support party goods for me that was</text><text start="726.399" dur="4.24">super inspiring because it was not a oh</text><text start="729.12" dur="3.519">i&apos;ll give away some of my money as</text><text start="730.639" dur="2.961">donations it was kind of like a rally</text><text start="732.639" dur="2.721">and like</text><text start="733.6" dur="3.679">being very supportive and co-creating</text><text start="735.36" dur="4.479">with each other uh whenever people</text><text start="737.279" dur="4.56">participate in the grants so it was kind</text><text start="739.839" dur="3.68">of like a perfect matchup of like me</text><text start="741.839" dur="4.081">already having the projects and then</text><text start="743.519" dur="4.161">like that gives you bitcoin spirit and</text><text start="745.92" dur="3.44">community being kind of like an</text><text start="747.68" dur="4.56">inspiration and</text><text start="749.36" dur="4.44">and something i looked up for up to</text><text start="752.24" dur="2.96">so yeah um um</text><text start="753.8" dur="3.56">[Music]</text><text start="755.2" dur="5.04">where were we oh yeah on the impact our</text><text start="757.36" dur="5.2">book and the different the different</text><text start="760.24" dur="4.719">projects are out there i kind of like we</text><text start="762.56" dur="3.839">kind of see them as</text><text start="764.959" dur="3.44">so when i</text><text start="766.399" dur="4.161">paint the picture of the space it&apos;s</text><text start="768.399" dur="4.321">easier for me to paint in different kind</text><text start="770.56" dur="4.48">of like diagrams or</text><text start="772.72" dur="3.76">or different pictures and if i know</text><text start="775.04" dur="3.359">we&apos;re in a podcast we don&apos;t have</text><text start="776.48" dur="3.52">actually any diagram but</text><text start="778.399" dur="4.401">how i look at it is kind of like as a</text><text start="780.0" dur="4.72">tree um so if you think about it like in</text><text start="782.8" dur="3.68">the tree you have the roots so you have</text><text start="784.72" dur="4.0">the impact dials that are actually</text><text start="786.48" dur="4.159">building the infrastructure layer that</text><text start="788.72" dur="4.72">are allowing other impact house to build</text><text start="790.639" dur="6.0">on top of so that&apos;s like the layer ones</text><text start="793.44" dur="6.16">and and even like some tokenomic models</text><text start="796.639" dur="4.401">or some like ipnfts that people can use</text><text start="799.6" dur="3.52">in decentralized science different</text><text start="801.04" dur="3.599">things that people can use on top then</text><text start="803.12" dur="3.76">you have the</text><text start="804.639" dur="4.241">like you have the trunk of the tree on</text><text start="806.88" dur="5.12">top of the roots and those are the ones</text><text start="808.88" dur="5.199">doing research and then applying that to</text><text start="812.0" dur="4.16">actual use cases so you would think</text><text start="814.079" dur="3.841">about for example protocol labs that&apos;s</text><text start="816.16" dur="4.799">doing research right now in different</text><text start="817.92" dur="4.719">ways which we can find public goods like</text><text start="820.959" dur="3.841">interoperable ways such as like</text><text start="822.639" dur="5.361">retroactive funding or</text><text start="824.8" dur="5.039">or like the grants or</text><text start="828.0" dur="3.44">impact certificates in different ways</text><text start="829.839" dur="3.761">and then implementing that on different</text><text start="831.44" dur="4.639">projects and then you have like</text><text start="833.6" dur="6.16">of course the whole entire tree with all</text><text start="836.079" dur="5.041">the different areas of um impact</text><text start="839.76" dur="4.079">dials that</text><text start="841.12" dur="5.04">like of course many of them tend to vary</text><text start="843.839" dur="4.8">different areas of life and like a lot</text><text start="846.16" dur="4.479">of them like for example git contents to</text><text start="848.639" dur="4.081">financial but also social and</text><text start="850.639" dur="4.241">experiential but</text><text start="852.72" dur="5.04">like i try to map them on like the</text><text start="854.88" dur="5.44">primary area that they focus on such as</text><text start="857.76" dur="4.4">regenerative finance uh decentralized</text><text start="860.32" dur="4.24">science um</text><text start="862.16" dur="4.08">region communities that are this kind of</text><text start="864.56" dur="3.92">like eco villages</text><text start="866.24" dur="4.64">and restructuring how we operate as</text><text start="868.48" dur="3.919">little society their own economies and</text><text start="870.88" dur="3.12">their own tokens</text><text start="872.399" dur="4.161">and then finally</text><text start="874.0" dur="5.519">the last one will be common spools so i</text><text start="876.56" dur="5.04">refer to common spools as any new way of</text><text start="879.519" dur="4.081">like funding and</text><text start="881.6" dur="4.0">rewarding party goods and different</text><text start="883.6" dur="2.799">projects i&apos;m happy to go more on how</text><text start="885.6" dur="2.64">like</text><text start="886.399" dur="3.68">if they&apos;re within the tree it&apos;s because</text><text start="888.24" dur="4.159">like all of them are kind of like</text><text start="890.079" dur="4.081">interoperable symbiotic and work with</text><text start="892.399" dur="3.761">each other so they&apos;re part of the same</text><text start="894.16" dur="3.6">tree although they serve different</text><text start="896.16" dur="4.56">purposes and they tend to different</text><text start="897.76" dur="3.759">areas of social capital</text><text start="900.72" dur="3.359">right</text><text start="901.519" dur="4.161">yeah i mean i think that you know</text><text start="904.079" dur="4.241">there&apos;s there&apos;s a lot to dive in on</text><text start="905.68" dur="4.399">there i guess like the tldr is that uh</text><text start="908.32" dur="5.12">you and i have launched a book called</text><text start="910.079" dur="5.76">the impact dao uh registry and it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="913.44" dur="4.399">just the april 2292 edition i think</text><text start="915.839" dur="4.081">there&apos;s a hundred and something impact</text><text start="917.839" dur="4.401">owls that we discovered in carter</text><text start="919.92" dur="4.24">cartography in there and you can get it</text><text start="922.24" dur="3.36">at store.getcoin.com check the show</text><text start="924.16" dur="3.6">notes if you want to pick up a copy of</text><text start="925.6" dur="4.96">the book and it&apos;s worth it to see the</text><text start="927.76" dur="4.319">visual of that tree that you mentioned</text><text start="930.56" dur="3.12">right there with the trunk being the</text><text start="932.079" dur="4.241">tooling in the infrastructure and then</text><text start="933.68" dur="4.8">sort of the leaves being all of the</text><text start="936.32" dur="4.48">different projects that are impactiles</text><text start="938.48" dur="4.159">in the space um and i</text><text start="940.8" dur="4.159">you know what gets really interesting to</text><text start="942.639" dur="4.081">me about this impactile space is like</text><text start="944.959" dur="4.24">you said the</text><text start="946.72" dur="5.039">the fact that everything in this</text><text start="949.199" dur="4.721">space the impact l space by definition</text><text start="951.759" dur="4.32">is creating positive externalities means</text><text start="953.92" dur="3.839">that it&apos;s creating this ecosystem it&apos;s</text><text start="956.079" dur="2.961">not like a machine where all you have</text><text start="957.759" dur="2.801">all these parts that are just sort of</text><text start="959.04" dur="2.88">like transactionally interoperating with</text><text start="960.56" dur="4.079">each other you actually have this</text><text start="961.92" dur="4.4">infinite garden of this rich fauna and</text><text start="964.639" dur="3.041">plants that are all growing on top of</text><text start="966.32" dur="3.92">each other and nourishing a common</text><text start="967.68" dur="4.719">ecosystem through which the sum is</text><text start="970.24" dur="3.2">greater than each of its parts and i</text><text start="972.399" dur="4.0">think that that&apos;s what&apos;s really cool</text><text start="973.44" dur="5.199">about impact owls is how they stack and</text><text start="976.399" dur="4.0">you know i think of like git coin which</text><text start="978.639" dur="2.64">i&apos;m the founder of and i work on git</text><text start="980.399" dur="3.12">coin</text><text start="981.279" dur="4.56">works with quadratic funding which is a</text><text start="983.519" dur="3.68">way of democratically distributing funds</text><text start="985.839" dur="3.601">to the ethereum community that&apos;s a</text><text start="987.199" dur="4.88">positive externality that get coin has</text><text start="989.44" dur="4.959">um and we rely on proof of humanity</text><text start="992.079" dur="4.641">another impact dow for civil resistance</text><text start="994.399" dur="4.56">for quadratic funding and so git coin</text><text start="996.72" dur="4.239">derives civil resistance from proof of</text><text start="998.959" dur="4.0">humanity and proof of humanity actually</text><text start="1000.959" dur="4.88">raised money on git coin so there&apos;s this</text><text start="1002.959" dur="5.041">sort of like symbiosis that happens in</text><text start="1005.839" dur="5.12">that one-to-one relationship but also</text><text start="1008.0" dur="6.0">the one to many the many to many in this</text><text start="1010.959" dur="5.281">ecosystem and so if we can nurture this</text><text start="1014.0" dur="4.88">ecosystem of impact dials then i think</text><text start="1016.24" dur="4.24">it becomes really cool to think about</text><text start="1018.88" dur="4.48">what we&apos;re building towards is this sort</text><text start="1020.48" dur="5.04">of diverse fauna of different ways of</text><text start="1023.36" dur="4.479">creating pluralistic support for human</text><text start="1025.52" dur="4.0">communities and in shared needs so i&apos;m</text><text start="1027.839" dur="5.36">really excited about how impact al&apos;s</text><text start="1029.52" dur="6.799">stack is is um you know i guess where i</text><text start="1033.199" dur="4.161">was going with that but um yeah i mean</text><text start="1036.319" dur="2.801">what else do you want to say about the</text><text start="1037.36" dur="4.319">impact dial book what what&apos;s the highest</text><text start="1039.12" dur="4.48">order bit for you yeah i think there&apos;s</text><text start="1041.679" dur="4.0">two areas i&apos;m</text><text start="1043.6" dur="4.64">most excited about with the book uh</text><text start="1045.679" dur="4.24">happy to dive like in order actually</text><text start="1048.24" dur="3.76">there&apos;s three right there&apos;s the first</text><text start="1049.919" dur="4.561">that i talk about more the theoretical</text><text start="1052.0" dur="4.64">like shift in mental models mental</text><text start="1054.48" dur="3.92">frameworks and how we view impact which</text><text start="1056.64" dur="3.919">i think is the one that actually fires</text><text start="1058.4" dur="5.04">me up the most and then the second one</text><text start="1060.559" dur="5.601">will be this impactile stacks which is</text><text start="1063.44" dur="4.96">both cool i offer a perspective of like</text><text start="1066.16" dur="4.56">how i think six different impact dials</text><text start="1068.4" dur="4.48">including git coin proof of humanity</text><text start="1070.72" dur="5.04">collectivo astral</text><text start="1072.88" dur="4.72">and radical drapes can like operate with</text><text start="1075.76" dur="3.36">each other and then there&apos;s a final</text><text start="1077.6" dur="3.68">aspect of the book would be the</text><text start="1079.12" dur="2.96">different case studies and just trying</text><text start="1081.28" dur="2.96">to</text><text start="1082.08" dur="4.64">merge both the</text><text start="1084.24" dur="4.24">how do these impact house operate like</text><text start="1086.72" dur="3.839">their strategy their mechanisms how</text><text start="1088.48" dur="4.559">they&apos;re using web3 but also grounding</text><text start="1090.559" dur="5.36">that into how they&apos;re impacting like</text><text start="1093.039" dur="4.88">human lives so that actually almost any</text><text start="1095.919" dur="4.0">kind of reader can understand it they</text><text start="1097.919" dur="4.481">don&apos;t have to be like super super into</text><text start="1099.919" dur="4.561">web3 to be able to get a sense of that</text><text start="1102.4" dur="4.24">so it&apos;s a i&apos;m trying to achieve a good</text><text start="1104.48" dur="3.92">balance there between the human aspect</text><text start="1106.64" dur="4.399">and also the technical aspect</text><text start="1108.4" dur="5.12">so happy to dive in either of the three</text><text start="1111.039" dur="4.241">yeah i was actually thinking um</text><text start="1113.52" dur="3.68">that it might be good to just talk about</text><text start="1115.28" dur="3.92">a couple of the impact owls in the book</text><text start="1117.2" dur="3.92">just to ground the listener</text><text start="1119.2" dur="3.839">in what an impact dow actually looks</text><text start="1121.12" dur="3.679">like in practice so you mind if we get</text><text start="1123.039" dur="4.241">like real tangible and then we can</text><text start="1124.799" dur="4.24">escape into the theoretical from there</text><text start="1127.28" dur="4.08">yeah yeah absolutely do you want to go</text><text start="1129.039" dur="3.601">first and and tell us about uh a couple</text><text start="1131.36" dur="4.16">impact dials you&apos;re excited about and</text><text start="1132.64" dur="4.8">what they do yeah i think</text><text start="1135.52" dur="4.24">the well</text><text start="1137.44" dur="4.16">first like how we chose impact just for</text><text start="1139.76" dur="2.799">people to get a sense of that</text><text start="1141.6" dur="3.439">um</text><text start="1142.559" dur="4.321">it&apos;s mainly just like a few a few points</text><text start="1145.039" dur="4.561">there would be that there have been</text><text start="1146.88" dur="4.96">proven to have a strategy that&apos;s like</text><text start="1149.6" dur="5.04">sustainable in the long term or at least</text><text start="1151.84" dur="5.04">until now like a very sound strategy on</text><text start="1154.64" dur="4.32">achieving impact in the world and they</text><text start="1156.88" dur="3.919">don&apos;t only have positive externalities</text><text start="1158.96" dur="4.959">on their individual outcomes but they&apos;re</text><text start="1160.799" dur="4.801">also enabling better outcomes for those</text><text start="1163.919" dur="4.961">around them so like in this impact i&apos;ll</text><text start="1165.6" dur="6.079">stacks and finally there we try to in</text><text start="1168.88" dur="4.799">include all the ones that have like</text><text start="1171.679" dur="3.841">never like there are attacking leverage</text><text start="1173.679" dur="4.321">points in the system where like one</text><text start="1175.52" dur="5.6">small change has like rippling effects</text><text start="1178.0" dur="5.6">on the rest of the system um so like</text><text start="1181.12" dur="3.84">for like for example i can think of like</text><text start="1183.6" dur="4.24">it is not a</text><text start="1184.96" dur="5.44">completely serious dial but one example</text><text start="1187.84" dur="4.8">that i really really love um is like the</text><text start="1190.4" dur="6.08">cello ecosystem because they&apos;re like</text><text start="1192.64" dur="5.52">building for a inclusion first so what</text><text start="1196.48" dur="5.28">they do is take their mobile uh they&apos;re</text><text start="1198.16" dur="6.48">a layer one um like yeah proof of stake</text><text start="1201.76" dur="5.76">but in general like anyone with a cell</text><text start="1204.64" dur="4.96">phone can actually access um</text><text start="1207.52" dur="4.08">different ways to transact money with</text><text start="1209.6" dur="4.559">like valora app and different</text><text start="1211.6" dur="4.16">applications within cello and what what</text><text start="1214.159" dur="3.921">this enables is that people around the</text><text start="1215.76" dur="5.279">world like in the philippines in kenya</text><text start="1218.08" dur="5.2">in peru in everywhere around the world</text><text start="1221.039" dur="4.401">can actually um</text><text start="1223.28" dur="4.399">get rich these ways to transact money</text><text

out book and release</text><text start="1969.12" dur="3.12">it by youth amsterdam so it was like</text><text start="1970.64" dur="2.96">this whirlwind of like two months of</text><text start="1972.24" dur="3.2">doing cardography and putting it</text><text start="1973.6" dur="4.0">together in a book but where do we go</text><text start="1975.44" dur="3.52">from here um i know that you&apos;re starting</text><text start="1977.6" dur="3.04">to host calls with the impact dow</text><text start="1978.96" dur="3.199">cartographers where what else can we</text><text start="1980.64" dur="4.32">sort of expect from the impact l</text><text start="1982.159" dur="4.961">ecosystem yeah absolutely and i would</text><text start="1984.96" dur="4.719">say like getting stressed on me on</text><text start="1987.12" dur="4.399">writing a book together after meeting</text><text start="1989.679" dur="4.561">each other like one day that was that</text><text start="1991.519" dur="4.321">was huge it was very funny but</text><text start="1994.24" dur="3.76">i would say</text><text start="1995.84" dur="2.16">the</text><text start="1998.159" dur="5.201">some of the ideas um pointing up from</text><text start="2000.64" dur="5.039">the impact our cartography group are</text><text start="2003.36" dur="4.799">well in general like first of all better</text><text start="2005.679" dur="4.961">ways to just like collaborate with each</text><text start="2008.159" dur="5.041">other share learnings share what works</text><text start="2010.64" dur="4.879">what doesn&apos;t share like impact our</text><text start="2013.2" dur="5.199">primitives like even the book we share</text><text start="2015.519" dur="4.88">like a few primitives or like three</text><text start="2018.399" dur="3.76">strategies that are useful that other</text><text start="2020.399" dur="4.801">people can fork and implement in their</text><text start="2022.159" dur="5.041">projects so that we stop making the same</text><text start="2025.2" dur="3.68">mistakes and just start like moving</text><text start="2027.2" dur="3.92">forward and have increased feedback</text><text start="2028.88" dur="4.32">loops i i&apos;m</text><text start="2031.12" dur="4.72">very excited about projects as well such</text><text start="2033.2" dur="3.68">as like prime dial that has like this</text><text start="2035.84" dur="3.92">like</text><text start="2036.88" dur="5.12">shared venture so like if two projects</text><text start="2039.76" dur="5.279">or or three projects or ten have like</text><text start="2042.0" dur="4.799">the same problem and the same like block</text><text start="2045.039" dur="3.921">on the road they can actually fund like</text><text start="2046.799" dur="4.641">a search re shared research or product</text><text start="2048.96" dur="5.04">or venture to actually unlock that uh so</text><text start="2051.44" dur="4.479">projects like that um like really</text><text start="2054.0" dur="4.159">finding like how do we collaborate more</text><text start="2055.919" dur="4.48">as an ecosystem and grow together so</text><text start="2058.159" dur="3.841">there&apos;s that also we&apos;re working on like</text><text start="2060.399" dur="4.401">different ways to</text><text start="2062.0" dur="5.28">like prove impact or to create impact</text><text start="2064.8" dur="6.0">certificates to reward and</text><text start="2067.28" dur="5.359">uh to finance more impact projects and</text><text start="2070.8" dur="4.64">we want to create this in a way as well</text><text start="2072.639" dur="4.641">that is not as oh i&apos;m judging your input</text><text start="2075.44" dur="4.0">or i&apos;m trying to see if you&apos;re doing</text><text start="2077.28" dur="3.92">well or not it&apos;s just more from a way of</text><text start="2079.44" dur="4.399">like how do we</text><text start="2081.2" dur="4.719">make sure that the funding resources and</text><text start="2083.839" dur="3.76">energy and talent are going towards the</text><text start="2085.919" dur="3.281">solutions that are creating the most</text><text start="2087.599" dur="3.601">impact and the most</text><text start="2089.2" dur="4.32">positive change so we can continue to</text><text start="2091.2" dur="4.159">iterate on that so it&apos;s more of a</text><text start="2093.52" dur="3.839">feedback loop on</text><text start="2095.359" dur="4.72">improving our strategy it&apos;s not about</text><text start="2097.359" dur="4.48">like measuring and just like backlashing</text><text start="2100.079" dur="4.161">or or</text><text start="2101.839" dur="4.801">and then other types of thing i&apos;m really</text><text start="2104.24" dur="4.48">excited about actually the work that&apos;s</text><text start="2106.64" dur="4.88">being done in the impact cryptographer</text><text start="2108.72" dur="5.359">group but also more broadly within</text><text start="2111.52" dur="4.8">uh git coin as their grants 2.0 starts</text><text start="2114.079" dur="4.161">coming up or protocol dapps with their</text><text start="2116.32" dur="4.72">public um networked</text><text start="2118.24" dur="4.879">funding in which we discover different</text><text start="2121.04" dur="3.6">ways in which we can actually fund and</text><text start="2123.119" dur="5.521">reward public goods that are</text><text start="2124.64" dur="6.64">interoperable and also tend to different</text><text start="2128.64" dur="5.199">um like different pro different types of</text><text start="2131.28" dur="4.64">projects and different areas the project</text><text start="2133.839" dur="3.921">like different stages the project is in</text><text start="2135.92" dur="3.439">so we can continue to create and find</text><text start="2137.76" dur="3.68">these public goods and to make sure that</text><text start="2139.359" dur="3.921">people are working on them are fully</text><text start="2141.44" dur="4.0">rewarded for their work</text><text start="2143.28" dur="4.0">um so yeah those are some some of the</text><text start="2145.44" dur="4.159">strategies also</text><text start="2147.28" dur="4.559">always engaging in these broader</text><text start="2149.599" dur="4.801">uh theoretical mental models of like how</text><text start="2151.839" dur="5.601">do we incorporate that shifting mindsets</text><text start="2154.4" dur="5.439">into this whole entire work but feel art</text><text start="2157.44" dur="5.28">will be impact certificates proof of</text><text start="2159.839" dur="5.121">impact better ways to share learnings</text><text start="2162.72" dur="5.52">and coordinate and better ways to find</text><text start="2164.96" dur="5.68">out a talent to this impact that was and</text><text start="2168.24" dur="4.0">in general just how do we shift help</text><text start="2170.64" dur="4.16">grow the ecosystem in a more</text><text start="2172.24" dur="4.48">collaborative way yeah totally you know</text><text start="2174.8" dur="3.52">it&apos;s so rewarding to work on this impact</text><text start="2176.72" dur="4.16">owl space because</text><text start="2178.32" dur="4.08">when we articulate to the space how</text><text start="2180.88" dur="3.52">dials are actually having a positive</text><text start="2182.4" dur="4.0">impact on the world that creates more</text><text start="2184.4" dur="4.16">legitimacy for those dows it creates</text><text start="2186.4" dur="4.56">more legitimacy for the space it&apos;s not</text><text start="2188.56" dur="4.4">just decentralized casinos anymore we&apos;ll</text><text start="2190.96" dur="3.119">actually have proven examples of</text><text start="2192.96" dur="3.28">creating</text><text start="2194.079" dur="3.921">uh systems that solve for everyday human</text><text start="2196.24" dur="4.48">problems and i think that there&apos;s</text><text start="2198.0" dur="5.76">there&apos;s sort of a loop there where it&apos;s</text><text start="2200.72" dur="4.639">theory and then action and then learning</text><text start="2203.76" dur="3.839">into more theory and the more that we</text><text start="2205.359" dur="5.041">can spin that virtuous cycle as a</text><text start="2207.599" dur="5.52">flywheel as an ecosystem together the</text><text start="2210.4" dur="4.24">more we can shift the market cycles of</text><text start="2213.119" dur="3.281">crypto into things that are actually</text><text start="2214.64" dur="3.28">helping people and so i think that</text><text start="2216.4" dur="3.04">that&apos;s sort of the end game of the work</text><text start="2217.92" dur="4.159">with the impact dow book that we&apos;ve been</text><text start="2219.44" dur="4.56">doing together and um you and i will</text><text start="2222.079" dur="3.601">just be hanging out kind of</text><text start="2224.0" dur="3.68">holding space for the people who are</text><text start="2225.68" dur="3.6">working on this space creating social</text><text start="2227.68" dur="3.28">shelling points</text><text start="2229.28" dur="3.36">maybe we&apos;ll do a second iteration of the</text><text start="2230.96" dur="4.24">book like maybe once a year we update</text><text start="2232.64" dur="4.56">the registry and and talk about how the</text><text start="2235.2" dur="4.639">impact out space has changed year over</text><text start="2237.2" dur="3.919">year but um you know it takes a village</text><text start="2239.839" dur="3.681">it takes all of us to build this</text><text start="2241.119" dur="4.801">ecosystem so it&apos;s really</text><text start="2243.52" dur="4.0">uh i think the highest purpose the</text><text start="2245.92" dur="3.12">highest use of my time to be working on</text><text start="2247.52" dur="3.68">this but it&apos;s also a lot of fun i&apos;ve met</text><text start="2249.04" dur="3.76">so many great people that are working on</text><text start="2251.2" dur="3.04">impact dials like there&apos;s just like a</text><text start="2252.8" dur="3.6">mimetic filter where if you&apos;re working</text><text start="2254.24" dur="3.92">on an impact dial then your vibes are</text><text start="2256.4" dur="4.64">good and and that&apos;s one of the most</text><text start="2258.16" dur="4.56">rewarding things for me uh of of getting</text><text start="2261.04" dur="3.76">networked in the impact l space yeah</text><text start="2262.72" dur="4.16">absolutely since we&apos;re not surprised</text><text start="2264.8" dur="4.0">like the book i&apos;ve connected with so</text><text start="2266.88" dur="3.76">many amazing projects that weren&apos;t in</text><text start="2268.8" dur="3.2">the book just because they were like</text><text start="2270.64" dur="3.04">they&apos;re brand new and they&apos;re just</text><text start="2272.0" dur="4.48">coming up and they&apos;re like</text><text start="2273.68" dur="5.6">awesome and amazing and also i think for</text><text start="2276.48" dur="4.8">me in general what three</text><text start="2279.28" dur="4.0">for me what three is just like the tool</text><text start="2281.28" dur="3.92">and mechanism that will lead us to solve</text><text start="2283.28" dur="4.72">like what some of the world&apos;s biggest</text><text start="2285.2" dur="4.8">problems and impact dials</text><text start="2288.0" dur="4.24">like shaping the way forward for where</text><text start="2290.0" dur="4.32">three to just like almost completely in</text><text start="2292.24" dur="4.0">that sense and we&apos;re starting with like</text><text start="2294.32" dur="2.72">of course this holding the space for</text><text start="2296.24" dur="3.04">this</text><text start="2297.04" dur="4.64">small but growing ecosystem but if we</text><text start="2299.28" dur="4.72">want if we can see like most of like</text><text start="2301.68" dur="4.399">what three tooling and resources energy</text><text start="2304.0" dur="5.04">being funneled to this space i think</text><text start="2306.079" dur="5.601">that will be hugely hugely exciting and</text><text start="2309.04" dur="4.88">yeah with the amazing um change</text><text start="2311.68" dur="3.84">yeah totally and i feel like you know</text><text start="2313.92" dur="3.28">one of the the coolest things that i</text><text start="2315.52" dur="3.36">think that we could potentially create</text><text start="2317.2" dur="3.28">like the ultimate north star for me is</text><text start="2318.88" dur="3.76">kind of like what if we could create a</text><text start="2320.48" dur="4.32">world in which impact owls augment every</text><text start="2322.64" dur="5.12">income on the planet so basically you&apos;ve</text><text start="2324.8" dur="5.12">got a systemic incentive to</text><text start="2327.76" dur="3.68">uh work on the commons for everyday</text><text start="2329.92" dur="5.919">agents in the system whether those are</text><text start="2331.44" dur="6.56">humans or ais or daos uh to to work in</text><text start="2335.839" dur="4.481">on the commons to fund and build our</text><text start="2338.0" dur="3.76">shared needs and i</text><text start="2340.32" dur="3.039">i think that</text><text start="2341.76" dur="3.76">web 3 as the</text><text start="2343.359" dur="4.24">ultimate coordination mechanism for</text><text start="2345.52" dur="3.44">humanity has the ability it&apos;s like the</text><text start="2347.599" dur="3.361">substrate through which we could get</text><text start="2348.96" dur="3.84">impact owls into every corner of the</text><text start="2350.96" dur="3.44">world microsoft when they were starting</text><text start="2352.8" dur="2.799">out wanted to put a pc</text><text start="2354.4" dur="3.12">on every</text><text start="2355.599" dur="3.76">desk and we could have impact owls</text><text start="2357.52" dur="4.0">augmenting every income which creates a</text><text start="2359.359" dur="4.401">systemic incentive to</text><text start="2361.52" dur="4.88">fund public goods to work on the commons</text><text start="2363.76" dur="4.4">in everyday communities and so um i&apos;m</text><text start="2366.4" dur="3.6">really excited about this world and i&apos;m</text><text start="2368.16" dur="3.28">just so feel so happy that we met at</text><text start="2370.0" dur="3.52">east denver and that we&apos;re working on</text><text start="2371.44" dur="3.84">this together uh and we published a book</text><text start="2373.52" dur="4.24">together self-published a book but i</text><text start="2375.28" dur="5.559">think it still counts um anything i</text><text start="2377.76" dur="4.88">didn&apos;t ask you that you want to say ally</text><text start="2380.839" dur="4.28">um</text><text start="2382.64" dur="4.88">no i think
