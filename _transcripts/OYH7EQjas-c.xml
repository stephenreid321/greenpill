start="209.28" dur="4.8">really have been going deep on civil</text><text start="211.98" dur="4.38">resistance this season of the green pill</text><text start="214.08" dur="5.579">podcast and so really excited to talk</text><text start="216.36" dur="5.34">about Idina tell us about Idina and how</text><text start="219.659" dur="4.921">you think about civil resistance</text><text start="221.7" dur="4.619">yeah uh thanks for inviting us really</text><text start="224.58" dur="3.78">appreciate that I think the Civil</text><text start="226.319" dur="4.5">resistance very important topic and it&apos;s</text><text start="228.36" dur="5.58">getting even more and more uh attention</text><text start="230.819" dur="4.621">across different platform last time</text><text start="233.94" dur="6.859">so</text><text start="235.44" dur="5.359">uh yeah let me introduce myself first</text><text start="240.84" dur="4.259">um</text><text start="241.519" dur="6.481">yeah I&apos;m under I&apos;m a co-founder for Dina</text><text start="245.099" dur="5.581">I&apos;m software engineer and before crypto</text><text start="248.0" dur="4.299">I&apos;ve been uh for more than 10 years in</text><text start="250.68" dur="5.36">it and</text><text start="252.299" dur="7.22">uh I&apos;ve learned about Bitcoin in 2015</text><text start="256.04" dur="6.58">and I was really amazed about Bitcoin</text><text start="259.519" dur="5.501">uh because what I learned about this is</text><text start="262.62" dur="6.24">is not a digital currency it&apos;s not like</text><text start="265.02" dur="6.66">a PayPal but it&apos;s something new and it</text><text start="268.86" dur="5.46">has no underlying asset and it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="271.68" dur="5.16">a value itself which exists only on the</text><text start="274.32" dur="5.52">on the web which is really kind of</text><text start="276.84" dur="5.579">amazing idea and the most important part</text><text start="279.84" dur="5.28">for me was that that nobody solely</text><text start="282.419" dur="5.161">controls the Bitcoin so it&apos;s</text><text start="285.12" dur="4.98">what civil resistance is about</text><text start="287.58" dur="4.98">and in 2015 we started the</text><text start="290.1" dur="4.74">semi-decentralized crypto exchange it</text><text start="292.56" dur="3.66">was the first swiss-based crypto</text><text start="294.84" dur="4.859">Exchange in Europe</text><text start="296.22" dur="6.3">and uh it was a non-custodial</text><text start="299.699" dur="6.181">semi-decentralized setup where you could</text><text start="302.52" dur="5.34">control your money with a private key so</text><text start="305.88" dur="3.539">that exchange could not get your</text><text start="307.86" dur="3.24">deposited coins</text><text start="309.419" dur="3.361">but at the same time you could trade</text><text start="311.1" dur="3.96">back and forth with a speed of normal</text><text start="312.78" dur="4.02">centralized exchange so what we did is</text><text start="315.06" dur="5.46">we provided the premium channels for</text><text start="316.8" dur="5.899">trading for users and it was a you know</text><text start="320.52" dur="4.86">a building block for lighting network</text><text start="322.699" dur="5.401">but we we were live even before the</text><text start="325.38" dur="6.659">lightning network was launched that time</text><text start="328.1" dur="5.8">and we learned a lot about the layer 2</text><text start="332.039" dur="4.741">scalability Solutions</text><text start="333.9" dur="6.84">and there are lots of trade-offs you</text><text start="336.78" dur="7.68">know uh about the the about that and</text><text start="340.74" dur="6.36">it&apos;s a complexity liquidity problem and</text><text start="344.46" dur="5.519">ultimately all the layers to scalability</text><text start="347.1" dur="5.52">techniques are kind of constrained by</text><text start="349.979" dur="5.94">the limitations of the first layer of</text><text start="352.62" dur="5.82">the blockchain itself and uh and that</text><text start="355.919" dur="5.581">was the starting point for Idina we</text><text start="358.44" dur="4.38">actually decided to solve that problem</text><text start="361.5" dur="3.479">so</text><text start="362.82" dur="4.02">we we didn&apos;t want to make you know</text><text start="364.979" dur="5.761">identity protocol</text><text start="366.84" dur="5.4">and idea was that we just make a</text><text start="370.74" dur="3.72">scalable blockchain</text><text start="372.24" dur="4.08">that can perform a substantial number of</text><text start="374.46" dur="3.959">transactions without decreasing the</text><text start="376.32" dur="5.34">level of decentralization</text><text start="378.419" dur="5.4">and actually this is kind of a you know</text><text start="381.66" dur="3.72">we try to solve this scalability through</text><text start="383.819" dur="4.681">now</text><text start="385.38" dur="6.18">so that is that we just enabled parallel</text><text start="388.5" dur="5.88">on chain computation which which is a</text><text start="391.56" dur="5.4">sharding and instead of running one</text><text start="394.38" dur="5.22">blockchain we we run just many</text><text start="396.96" dur="4.739">interconnected chains and instead of</text><text start="399.6" dur="4.26">running just one state machine we run</text><text start="401.699" dur="4.141">multiple State machines which are</text><text start="403.86" dur="5.58">secured by independent set of validators</text><text start="405.84" dur="4.76">so cam how how can it you know make it</text><text start="409.44" dur="5.78">securely</text><text start="410.6" dur="4.62">uh we just you know</text><text start="415.259" dur="4.081">to make it to make that possible we just</text><text start="417.3" dur="4.86">needed to have as many independent</text><text start="419.34" dur="5.52">validators as possible to secure Every</text><text start="422.16" dur="5.099">Chain you know so we needed to have an</text><text start="424.86" dur="5.52">excessive decentralization</text><text start="427.259" dur="4.861">which is I think the key for uh solving</text><text start="430.38" dur="5.7">the scalability tutorial</text><text start="432.12" dur="6.9">and the silver resistant that I&apos;m was</text><text start="436.08" dur="5.28">really very very practical you know for</text><text start="439.02" dur="4.14">us it was it has a really practical</text><text start="441.36" dur="4.14">meaning for us</text><text start="443.16" dur="4.86">uh but the problem was that we couldn&apos;t</text><text start="445.5" dur="3.9">find you know the right basis for this</text><text start="448.02" dur="3.899">decentralization</text><text start="449.4" dur="5.28">what we understood that time that money</text><text start="451.919" dur="4.861">doesn&apos;t work staking doesn&apos;t work</text><text start="454.68" dur="4.079">because of the nature of capitals you</text><text start="456.78" dur="3.78">know it&apos;s it&apos;s a wealth is getting</text><text start="458.759" dur="6.421">productive distributed all the time so</text><text start="460.56" dur="6.84">we we go like we reach get richer so we</text><text start="465.18" dur="4.799">needed to find a better basis for civil</text><text start="467.4" dur="4.32">resistance which is kind of scars but</text><text start="469.979" dur="4.321">you know opposite to money</text><text start="471.72" dur="5.819">and the question was</text><text start="474.3" dur="5.64">so what is the you know the most evenly</text><text start="477.539" dur="4.981">distributed resource on the planet it&apos;s</text><text start="479.94" dur="5.52">not money it&apos;s not CPUs it&apos;s not</text><text start="482.52" dur="5.28">electricity so what&apos;s that and the</text><text start="485.46" dur="4.019">answer was it&apos;s us you know it&apos;s human</text><text start="487.8" dur="5.94">beings</text><text start="489.479" dur="5.94">so yeah this is how we started with this</text><text start="493.74" dur="6.299">civil resistance</text><text start="495.419" dur="6.96">and yeah and you know interesting uh</text><text start="500.039" dur="5.821">interesting part here is that</text><text start="502.379" dur="5.76">uh because we just came up with the idea</text><text start="505.86" dur="5.94">of of human beings</text><text start="508.139" dur="5.46">we we try to get a better understanding</text><text start="511.8" dur="4.2">of civil resistance problem</text><text start="513.599" dur="4.68">because initial definition of civil</text><text start="516.0" dur="4.26">resistant attack was telling us about</text><text start="518.279" dur="5.041">the large number of you know of</text><text start="520.26" dur="5.4">pseudonymous accounts which attacker can</text><text start="523.32" dur="4.019">you know create to get a</text><text start="525.66" dur="2.7">disproportionately large influence on</text><text start="527.339" dur="3.18">the system</text><text start="528.36" dur="4.8">but satosh actually changed that</text><text start="530.519" dur="5.82">definition so instead of using accounts</text><text start="533.16" dur="5.46">he used CPUs like to make a civil attack</text><text start="536.339" dur="4.801">on proof of work you need to buy lots of</text><text start="538.62" dur="4.56">CPUs to make a civil attack on profile</text><text start="541.14" dur="4.02">State system you need to buy lots of</text><text start="543.18" dur="4.86">coins like for example to attack</text><text start="545.16" dur="5.58">ethereum we need to have like many</text><text start="548.04" dur="5.58">accounts with 32 East ethers each you</text><text start="550.74" dur="5.099">know and a kind of joke you know to</text><text start="553.62" dur="4.14">attack a Twitter you need to to to make</text><text start="555.839" dur="2.901">many accounts with you know eight bucks</text><text start="557.76" dur="5.22">each</text><text start="558.74" dur="5.88">which is kind of a job but is it is it</text><text start="562.98" dur="3.84">going to be kind of civil resistance</text><text start="564.62" dur="3.42">resistance I think I don&apos;t think I don&apos;t</text><text start="566.82" dur="4.62">think so</text><text start="568.04" dur="6.76">and what we currently have in ethereum</text><text start="571.44" dur="6.6">uh you know that more than 70 of the</text><text start="574.8" dur="6.24">blocks are currently offer compliant</text><text start="578.04" dur="5.82">which means that 70 of validators</text><text start="581.04" dur="5.76">actually follow their their rules</text><text start="583.86" dur="5.34">and is it okay</text><text start="586.8" dur="5.34">um I don&apos;t think so and the problem is</text><text start="589.2" dur="5.28">that we are as a community we just</text><text start="592.14" dur="5.1">agreed that it&apos;s okay to have large</text><text start="594.48" dur="5.359">stakeholders dominating the network</text><text start="597.24" dur="4.98">if their intentions are good</text><text start="599.839" dur="4.241">so if they&apos;re not interested in</text><text start="602.22" dur="3.239">attacking the system because they&apos;ll</text><text start="604.08" dur="3.6">lock their Stakes</text><text start="605.459" dur="5.461">but I think it&apos;s not okay and the reason</text><text start="607.68" dur="5.76">is actually what we have in in ethereum</text><text start="610.92" dur="4.7">is a civil attack</text><text start="613.44" dur="4.56">I mean the Civil resistance is not about</text><text start="615.62" dur="3.88">intentions you know civil attack is</text><text start="618.0" dur="3.12">definition is telling us about an</text><text start="619.5" dur="3.42">attacker gaining disproportion of the</text><text start="621.12" dur="3.3">large influence of the system this this</text><text start="622.92" dur="4.859">is what we have</text><text start="624.42" dur="6.419">you see that this 70 of validators could</text><text start="627.779" dur="6.0">follow the of fact rules are just a few</text><text start="630.839" dur="3.721">guys and this is nothing but civil</text><text start="633.779" dur="3.661">attack</text><text start="634.56" dur="4.98">and we failed to handle it and we failed</text><text start="637.44" dur="4.98">the Civil resistance War already</text><text start="639.54" dur="6.66">and the problem is that we accepted that</text><text start="642.42" dur="5.7">and now we if you want to solve that we</text><text start="646.2" dur="3.96">just need to acknowledge that problem I</text><text start="648.12" dur="4.2">think we shouldn&apos;t welcome civil</text><text start="650.16" dur="4.919">attackers even if their intentions are</text><text start="652.32" dur="6.18">good even you know because Regulators</text><text start="655.079" dur="6.421">can can come in and all you know local</text><text start="658.5" dur="5.16">government May account or their</text><text start="661.5" dur="5.279">intentions may change</text><text start="663.66" dur="5.34">or you know what if they can short the</text><text start="666.779" dur="5.941">stake points</text><text start="669.0" dur="6.36">yeah yeah so I mean I I think that we&apos;ve</text><text start="672.72" dur="6.059">kind of trodden the ground on green pill</text><text start="675.36" dur="5.219">of why civil resistance matters a lot so</text><text start="678.779" dur="4.261">basically moving from one token one vote</text><text start="680.579" dur="6.481">Dallas to more one human one boat dials</text><text start="683.04" dur="6.02">creates more democracy in how tokens are</text><text start="687.06" dur="4.8">distributed and how decisions are made</text><text start="689.06" dur="4.24">and you know I&apos;d be curious if you sort</text><text start="691.86" dur="2.94">of you sort of agree with that summary</text><text start="693.3" dur="3.42">if there&apos;s anything you would add to it</text><text start="694.8" dur="4.32">and then I want to talk about how Idina</text><text start="696.72" dur="5.179">creates civil resistance</text><text start="699.12" dur="2.779">um yeah</text><text start="702.48" dur="5.099">um yeah but before we just you know dive</text><text start="705.42" dur="6.12">into this a</text><text start="707.579" dur="5.241">um specific of IE Adina I would I would</text><text start="711.54" dur="3.66">uh</text><text start="712.82" dur="4.36">I will try as well to tell a bit more</text><text start="715.2" dur="4.319">about the you know</text><text start="717.18" dur="4.339">uh building I didn&apos;t kind of a unique</text><text start="719.519" dur="4.621">identity primitive you know</text><text start="721.519" dur="5.26">because uh</text><text start="724.14" dur="6.06">now you know when we started you know we</text><text start="726.779" dur="6.56">we tried to find the existing solution</text><text start="730.2" dur="6.06">for Unique identity primitive</text><text start="733.339" dur="4.601">and you know the problem was that I</text><text start="736.26" dur="4.62">didn&apos;t use the blockchain</text><text start="737.94" dur="6.72">and we needed to find a kind of a layer</text><text start="740.88" dur="6.36">one identity you know a solution but</text><text start="744.66" dur="4.799">you know identity identities identity</text><text start="747.24" dur="4.5">data is very sensitive and it&apos;s not</text><text start="749.459" dur="4.021">usually suitable for you know storing</text><text start="751.74" dur="3.659">this data on blockchain because</text><text start="753.48" dur="5.58">blockchain is immutable</text><text start="755.399" dur="6.0">and we we try to find kind of you know</text><text start="759.06" dur="4.68">privacy preserving or even better</text><text start="761.399" dur="4.74">Anonymous solution for that</text><text start="763.74" dur="4.26">and there were many other problems like</text><text start="766.139" dur="4.021">we needed to have the open source</text><text start="768.0" dur="5.399">solution we need to have decentralized</text><text start="770.16" dur="5.52">ai resistance resistant and you know</text><text start="773.399" dur="4.5">non-contextual non-subjective so it</text><text start="775.68" dur="4.14">should be like a global registry of</text><text start="777.899" dur="4.021">validated identities and</text><text start="779.82" dur="4.139">finally it should have been like we</text><text start="781.92" dur="3.06">needed to find it like if a puppet</text><text start="783.959" dur="4.141">resistant</text><text start="784.98" dur="4.08">solution which I think was the most</text><text start="788.1" dur="3.239">difficult</text><text start="789.06" dur="4.74">and we try to iterate with many in our</text><text start="791.339" dur="4.8">approaches we decided just not to go</text><text start="793.8" dur="3.779">with the government-based IDS because of</text><text start="796.139" dur="4.801">the Privacy issue you know government</text><text start="797.579" dur="6.0">trust issue and we learned about</text><text start="800.94" dur="3.3">biometric Solutions</text><text start="803.579" dur="2.82">um</text><text start="804.24" dur="3.96">they&apos;re all kind of a you know there are</text><text start="806.399" dur="4.021">proprietary solutions that cannot work</text><text start="808.2" dur="3.3">with blockchain and open source</text><text start="810.42" dur="3.599">Solutions</text><text start="811.5" dur="4.86">have their own trade-offs you know how</text><text start="814.019" dur="5.161">the Biometrics is analyzed either it&apos;s</text><text start="816.36" dur="5.4">publicly available like you publish your</text><text start="819.18" dur="4.5">you know Biometrics data on chain and</text><text start="821.76" dur="5.46">then we have a privacy issue or deep</text><text start="823.68" dur="6.899">Flex issues or it&apos;s a client-side you</text><text start="827.22" dur="6.96">know analysis like you have a public</text><text start="830.579" dur="6.301">neural net with some ZK knowledge proof</text><text start="834.18" dur="5.64">but then you you also have some problems</text><text start="836.88" dur="5.94">with white box attacks and the address</text><text start="839.82" dur="5.4">are operation attacks which are kind of</text><text start="842.82" dur="3.54">um which can be applied for the neural</text><text start="845.22" dur="4.5">Nets</text><text start="846.36" dur="6.659">so the and the last options that we we</text><text start="849.72" dur="4.739">could use and that was the attendance</text><text start="853.019" dur="4.201">based protocol</text><text start="854.459" dur="4.261">so because other other protocols</text><text start="857.22" dur="4.799">couldn&apos;t work with blockchains there are</text><text start="858.72" dur="6.6">too many trades of and we just decided</text><text start="862.019" dur="5.88">to go with the um kind of</text><text start="865.32" dur="3.74">a protocol that is based on you know on</text><text start="867.899" dur="3.901">participation</text><text start="869.06" dur="5.8">of you know users during the kind of</text><text start="871.8" dur="5.42">validation ceremons so the idea is that</text><text start="874.86" dur="5.4">people cannot have many</text><text start="877.22" dur="5.32">accounts because they they cannot be in</text><text start="880.26" dur="4.819">in many places at the same time because</text><text start="882.54" dur="6.0">the time is scarce</text><text start="885.079" dur="5.681">and we can&apos;t do the we can build it</text><text start="888.54" dur="6.239">protocol around that idea</text><text start="890.76" dur="6.6">and kind of make it in a way like people</text><text start="894.779" dur="4.92">usually validate each other without any</text><text start="897.36" dur="3.24">centralized body so initial idea you</text><text start="899.699" dur="5.101">know was</text><text start="900.6" dur="6.359">to run a global Zoom party when you know</text><text start="904.8" dur="4.92">people talk to each other at the same</text><text start="906.959" dur="6.661">time we try it you know we tested that</text><text start="909.72" dur="5.58">but it wasn&apos;t scalable enough and then</text><text start="913.62" dur="3.6">we just decided to go with the</text><text start="915.3" dur="3.539">validation ceremony when people were</text><text start="917.22" dur="4.559">people just communicate with each other</text><text start="918.839" dur="4.081">with some kind of a pre-arranged test</text><text start="921.779" dur="4.261">you know</text><text start="922.92" dur="5.159">and this is how we started hyena we</text><text start="926.04" dur="5.52">started like building our own protocol</text><text start="928.079" dur="7.62">for uh you know unique identity solution</text><text start="931.56" dur="4.139">and any identity primitive</text><text start="936.3" dur="6.96">right so um it seems like you wanted to</text><text start="939.6" dur="5.46">have a civil resistance technique that</text><text start="943.26" dur="4.379">was going to be privacy preserving</text><text start="945.06" dur="4.079">didn&apos;t have any pii</text><text start="947.639" dur="4.44">um and</text><text start="949.139" dur="4.38">and you know the zoom meetings were sort</text><text start="952.079" dur="3.06">of like the prior for you we actually</text><text start="953.519" dur="3.541">had Brian Ford on the podcast a few</text><text start="955.139" dur="3.541">episodes ago and he talked about four</text><text start="957.06" dur="5.339">ways to create civil resistance</text><text start="958.68" dur="5.339">biometric nation state IDs uh web of</text><text start="962.399" dur="3.601">trust and then the fourth one was</text><text start="964.019" dur="4.021">presence-based and so the one that</text><text start="966.0" dur="5.1">really jumps out to me with these sort</text><text start="968.04" dur="4.799">of Zoom parties being the the method</text><text start="971.1" dur="3.9">through which you wanted to emulate with</text><text start="972.839" dur="3.541">the Idina protocols is presence-based</text><text start="975.0" dur="4.56">you know if I&apos;m in the presence of you</text><text start="976.38" dur="6.06">at a certain time then you you can&apos;t be</text><text start="979.56" dur="4.74">two people at once on that same Zoom</text><text start="982.44" dur="4.079">party without people catching you is</text><text start="984.3" dur="4.38">that a fair take in a fair synopsis of</text><text start="986.519" dur="4.141">what you said yeah that&apos;s right uh</text><text start="988.68" dur="4.26">that&apos;s right this is what we we tried</text><text start="990.66" dur="5.58">and you know and tested and and we just</text><text start="992.94" dur="5.28">you know we couldn&apos;t kind of build the</text><text start="996.24" dur="5.279">right protocol for Zoom meetings because</text><text start="998.22" dur="6.0">we need to uh you know to let people</text><text start="1001.519" dur="4.38">talk at the same time and uh challenge</text><text start="1004.22" dur="4.14">each other you know at the same time</text><text start="1005.899" dur="4.201">which is pretty complicated</text><text start="1008.36" dur="3.719">yeah</text><text start="1010.1" dur="4.679">yeah well this feels like a great</text><text start="1012.079" dur="4.44">jumping off point to talk about the idea</text><text start="1014.779" dur="3.0">ceremony and how Idina creates civil</text><text start="1016.519" dur="3.541">resistance so you want to take us down</text><text start="1017.779" dur="2.941">that rabbit hole</text><text start="1020.06" dur="4.019">um</text><text start="1020.72" dur="6.119">I might take a bit like uh some some</text><text start="1024.079" dur="5.1">some more kind of details about what</text><text start="1026.839" dur="5.641">Adina is because uh I want to and</text><text start="1029.179" dur="6.081">emphasize that idea is not a civil</text><text start="1032.48" dur="6.54">resistance solution you know it&apos;s not a</text><text start="1035.26" dur="6.179">identity solution it&apos;s a blockchain and</text><text start="1039.02" dur="6.059">it&apos;s a general purpose blockchain</text><text start="1041.439" dur="7.12">uh that aims to encourage running a</text><text start="1045.079" dur="5.641">human-centric apps on top of it uh is is</text><text start="1048.559" dur="5.041">based on Democratic principles like one</text><text start="1050.72" dur="5.699">person one vote and it&apos;s not the kind of</text><text start="1053.6" dur="5.34">you know smart contract or it&apos;s not a</text><text start="1056.419" dur="4.561">fork of any existing blockchain it&apos;s it</text><text start="1058.94" dur="4.859">was developed from scratch and it&apos;s</text><text start="1060.98" dur="5.96">secured by the network of nodes which</text><text start="1063.799" dur="6.661">run by people it&apos;s either individual or</text><text start="1066.94" dur="6.4">uh or family you know family notes</text><text start="1070.46" dur="5.579">and every person can run the validating</text><text start="1073.34" dur="4.14">node with equal voting power which makes</text><text start="1076.039" dur="4.741">again one of the most decentralized</text><text start="1077.48" dur="5.939">blockchains and there are around 600</text><text start="1080.78" dur="5.1">nodes up and running as we speak so the</text><text start="1083.419" dur="3.781">core concept of the ideal protocol is a</text><text start="1085.88" dur="3.78">unique identity</text><text start="1087.2" dur="4.74">and we call it Crypt identity</text><text start="1089.66" dur="3.96">because it&apos;s somehow similar to</text><text start="1091.94" dur="5.46">cryptocurrency you know it has no</text><text start="1093.62" dur="6.0">underlying identity data it&apos;s anonymous</text><text start="1097.4" dur="5.24">it&apos;s Global so uniqueness is not</text><text start="1099.62" dur="7.08">contextual and it has no Central issue</text><text start="1102.64" dur="6.1">that could certify your uniqueness and</text><text start="1106.7" dur="3.54">is based on Mutual verification and</text><text start="1108.74" dur="3.84">validation parties</text><text start="1110.24" dur="5.52">and I think the most fascinating part</text><text start="1112.58" dur="6.36">about Idina civil resistance and pocket</text><text start="1115.76" dur="5.4">resistance is that is not just you know</text><text start="1118.94" dur="4.14">empowered by the crypto identity concept</text><text start="1121.16" dur="4.08">but it&apos;s empowered by the quadratic</text><text start="1123.08" dur="4.8">staking so I think the quadratic&apos;s</text><text start="1125.24" dur="5.819">taking is the most important part about</text><text start="1127.88" dur="5.64">Edina because civil resistant identity</text><text start="1131.059" dur="4.74">itself I think</text><text start="1133.52" dur="4.92">uh sorry to say that but I think that</text><text start="1135.799" dur="6.061">civil resistant identity is a myth</text><text start="1138.44" dur="5.28">however uh the identity primitive like</text><text start="1141.86" dur="3.9">unique identity primitive is a missing</text><text start="1143.72" dur="3.12">element for building simple resistance</text><text start="1145.76" dur="5.22">system</text><text start="1146.84" dur="6.62">and if you don&apos;t mind I just want to</text><text start="1150.98" dur="6.0">tell a bit more about this this</text><text start="1153.46" dur="6.76">provocative you know statement because</text><text start="1156.98" dur="6.18">um please go there yeah I think we were</text><text start="1160.22" dur="5.28">very idealistic when we started Edina</text><text start="1163.16" dur="4.98">we wanted to build a democratic system</text><text start="1165.5" dur="3.66">based on you know pure proof of personal</text><text start="1168.14" dur="3.539">food</text><text start="1169.16" dur="5.04">uh like one person one volt government</text><text start="1171.679" dur="4.38">system with equal mining reward</text><text start="1174.2" dur="3.9">distribution you know without any</text><text start="1176.059" dur="5.101">initial investment notes taking we</text><text start="1178.1" dur="4.319">wanted ideal to pay equal Ubi for their</text><text start="1181.16" dur="4.92">validators</text><text start="1182.419" dur="5.401">but uh the problems that unique identity</text><text start="1186.08" dur="4.86">is not enough for that</text><text start="1187.82" dur="5.219">it isn&apos;t civil resistant by itself and</text><text start="1190.94" dur="4.32">it doesn&apos;t matter which protocol you use</text><text start="1193.039" dur="6.0">for the proof of personhood either</text><text start="1195.26" dur="5.58">Biometrics of web of trust or it&apos;s even</text><text start="1199.039" dur="3.781">it could be even government-based</text><text start="1200.84" dur="4.68">identity you know the interesting thing</text><text start="1202.82" dur="6.66">is that there was a really cool project</text><text start="1205.52" dur="4.98">it&apos;s called ubic like ubic you can</text><text start="1209.48" dur="6.059">Google it</text><text start="1210.5" dur="7.2">it&apos;s a kind of a proof of proof of proof</text><text start="1215.539" dur="4.561">of passport identity solution</text><text start="1217.7" dur="4.859">you can uh you know to to make your</text><text start="1220.1" dur="4.68">identity you just need to scan your NFC</text><text start="1222.559" dur="5.161">chip of your passport</text><text start="1224.78" dur="4.86">with your iPhone you know and you you</text><text start="1227.72" dur="4.68">can get the zero Proof of Your Advantage</text><text start="1229.64" dur="5.22">on the blockchain immediately because so</text><text start="1232.4" dur="4.98">cool and so simple solution</text><text start="1234.86" dur="4.86">and it works really well until one guy</text><text start="1237.38" dur="5.52">from China came in and just submitted</text><text start="1239.72" dur="4.8">around 20 000 passport in one single</text><text start="1242.9" dur="4.98">batch</text><text start="1244.52" dur="5.64">it&apos;s really crazy I mean and the problem</text><text start="1247.88" dur="4.62">is that you can do the same with the you</text><text start="1250.16" dur="5.1">know video verification</text><text start="1252.5" dur="5.28">uh so people can say you some words for</text><text start="1255.26" dur="6.24">you on camera just for a few cents</text><text start="1257.78" dur="5.94">uh they can scan their faces or Aries</text><text start="1261.5" dur="4.5">for a few cents you know they can do</text><text start="1263.72" dur="3.24">even on a regular basis if you just pay</text><text start="1266.0" dur="4.62">them</text><text start="1266.96" dur="6.66">and this is kind of a you know evolution</text><text start="1270.62" dur="5.16">of fake identity arm race</text><text start="1273.62" dur="5.04">essentially proof of personhood is just</text><text start="1275.78" dur="5.22">a final stage of that iron race at the</text><text start="1278.66" dur="5.28">beginning we had an algorithmically</text><text start="1281.0" dur="6.12">based generated accounts like uh you</text><text start="1283.94" dur="6.54">know in the in the early stage of uh web</text><text start="1287.12" dur="4.799">2. so it&apos;s more or less solved the</text><text start="1290.48" dur="3.26">problem was more or less solved by</text><text start="1291.919" dur="4.201">captures we still use it</text><text start="1293.74" dur="4.72">and then</text><text start="1296.12" dur="4.38">the next stage was like of this arm race</text><text start="1298.46" dur="3.78">was just a human generated accounts</text><text start="1300.5" dur="4.32">where one guy could you know make</text><text start="1302.24" dur="4.26">hundreds of accounts per day and we</text><text start="1304.82" dur="4.92">currently have these human forms</text><text start="1306.5" dur="6.059">generating thousands of accounts 24 7</text><text start="1309.74" dur="7.5">and now sitting together</text><text start="1312.559" dur="7.62">and the hand and the third stage is a is</text><text start="1317.24" dur="5.96">a proof of presence for protocols uh</text><text start="1320.179" dur="5.461">which problem is like</text><text start="1323.2" dur="4.24">these protocols can be attacked with a</text><text start="1325.64" dur="4.7">kind of Puppets you know where many</text><text start="1327.44" dur="6.119">people can generate just many accounts</text><text start="1330.34" dur="5.62">each account is kind of is linked to one</text><text start="1333.559" dur="5.341">person and these private accounts are</text><text start="1335.96" dur="5.099">valid from the from the proof of kind of</text><text start="1338.9" dur="4.08">personal protocol perspective but</text><text start="1341.059" dur="4.381">they&apos;re not civil resistant you know</text><text start="1342.98" dur="5.4">what I mean so it&apos;s a it&apos;s not possible</text><text start="1345.44" dur="5.16">to prove who is exactly the owner of</text><text start="1348.38" dur="5.1">account and it&apos;s and it&apos;s really hard</text><text start="1350.6" dur="6.48">you know because usually this uh these</text><text start="1353.48" dur="5.34">people this kind of uh puppets they&apos;re</text><text start="1357.08" dur="4.44">they&apos;re not interested in kind of</text><text start="1358.82" dur="5.88">claiming their own uh accounts their</text><text start="1361.52" dur="5.519">ownership of their accounts so yeah this</text><text start="1364.7" dur="5.04">is this is a bad news you know for all</text><text

start="1403.46" dur="4.04">people just to extract the value</text><text start="1408.34" dur="8.199">yeah and what we have is uh</text><text start="1413.559" dur="5.801">ultimately we have two extremes there</text><text start="1416.539" dur="5.821">on the left side on the left hand we</text><text start="1419.36" dur="5.52">have an authoritarian systems where</text><text start="1422.36" dur="5.46">money doesn&apos;t matter it&apos;s a an identity</text><text start="1424.88" dur="5.06">Centric system and on the right side we</text><text start="1427.82" dur="6.3">have a plutocratic

creams</text><text start="1445.58" dur="4.979">extremes located on the same Dimension</text><text start="1447.86" dur="5.819">and we can generalize them</text><text start="1450.559" dur="5.041">and we can find a middle way between</text><text start="1453.679" dur="3.841">them you know by combining them together</text><text start="1455.6" dur="4.22">and this is what we call quadratic</text><text start="1457.52" dur="2.3">staking</text><text start="1460.159" dur="3.241">got it yeah so tell me about quadratic</text><text start="1462.5" dur="3.48">staking</text><text start="1463.4" dur="5.399">yeah I think that quadratics taking is</text><text start="1465.98" dur="6.0">real gem uh we were lucky to discover</text><text start="1468.799" dur="6.541">that uh you know idea and I&apos;m happy to</text><text start="1471.98" dur="4.02">share details about that with you</text><text start="1475.34" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="1476.0" dur="5.64">the quadratic staking is the model that</text><text start="1479.12" dur="4.74">actually combines proof of stake and</text><text start="1481.64" dur="4.26">naive proof of personhood</text><text start="1483.86" dur="3.84">it&apos;s a</text><text start="1485.9" dur="4.98">it&apos;s it&apos;s something that</text><text start="1487.7" dur="5.94">making you know makes your mining</text><text start="1490.88" dur="3.96">rewards proportional to square root of</text><text start="1493.64" dur="2.72">your stake</text><text start="1494.84" dur="3.78">so</text><text start="1496.36" dur="5.319">essentially it solves the plutocracy</text><text start="1498.62" dur="6.559">problem inherent in capitalist system</text><text start="1501.679" dur="5.941">so it discriminates against whales or</text><text start="1505.179" dur="5.081">large-scale investors</text><text start="1507.62" dur="5.34">and at the same time it increases the</text><text start="1510.26" dur="5.399">weights of small users and encourage</text><text start="1512.96" dur="4.28">them them you know to participate more</text><text start="1515.659" dur="5.821">actively</text><text start="1517.24" dur="5.08">so uh to make uh quadratics taking a</text><text start="1521.48" dur="4.26">work</text><text start="1522.32" dur="5.219">you need to have this you know a unique</text><text start="1525.74" dur="5.039">identity primitive</text><text start="1527.539" dur="5.401">because otherwise uh large stakeholders</text><text start="1530.779" dur="3.481">could just split their Stakes across</text><text start="1532.94" dur="4.32">many accounts</text><text start="1534.26" dur="4.62">but with the proof of personhood or kind</text><text start="1537.26" dur="4.5">of unique</text><text start="1538.88" dur="5.399">unique identity primitive you can stake</text><text start="1541.76" dur="5.519">the coins only if you have this kind of</text><text start="1544.279" dur="4.621">account validated account and you can</text><text start="1547.279" dur="4.26">just you know</text><text start="1548.9" dur="4.74">you can be slashed if you&apos;re if you</text><text start="1551.539" dur="3.781">don&apos;t prove your liveness</text><text start="1553.64" dur="3.659">and</text><text start="1555.32" dur="3.66">at the same time if you want to withdraw</text><text start="1557.299" dur="4.441">your stake then you need to terminate</text><text start="1558.98" dur="4.74">your account so it&apos;s fully your steak is</text><text start="1561.74" dur="3.6">fully connected with your uh unique</text><text start="1563.72" dur="4.14">identity and</text><text start="1565.34" dur="4.86">basically your stake is always at risk</text><text start="1567.86" dur="3.96">you know related to your uh proof of</text><text start="1570.2" dur="4.38">your uniqueness of your identity and</text><text start="1571.82" dur="6.719">which actually makes the identity</text><text start="1574.58" dur="6.78">primitive more civil resistance</text><text start="1578.539" dur="4.14">um so yeah so on the one hand we have a</text><text start="1581.36" dur="4.62">quadratic staking</text><text start="1582.679" dur="6.181">with just it&apos;s just an improved version</text><text start="1585.98" dur="4.86">of uh linear staking</text><text start="1588.86" dur="5.64">but on the other side on the other hand</text><text start="1590.84" dur="5.28">it makes any unique identity itself more</text><text start="1594.5" dur="3.299">civil resistant and more pocket</text><text start="1596.12" dur="4.32">resistance</text><text start="1597.799" dur="6.12">so this is what we actually see</text><text start="1600.44" dur="7.32">currently in Idina uh during last few</text><text start="1603.919" dur="6.36">months so before uh quadratic staking we</text><text start="1607.76" dur="5.159">observed a really aggressive growth of a</text><text start="1610.279" dur="4.38">human farms and after we released the</text><text start="1612.919" dur="4.86">hard Fork update with the quadratic</text><text start="1614.659" dur="5.101">staking and what will then we we see the</text><text start="1617.779" dur="3.741">decrease in human forms actually human</text><text start="1619.76" dur="5.22">forms just</text><text start="1621.52" dur="6.12">who made their accounts just to extract</text><text start="1624.98" dur="7.02">the value from the network</text><text start="1627.64" dur="5.32">decide to to stop their business</text><text start="1632.0" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="1632.96" dur="3.9">so yeah so this is this is what</text><text start="1634.88" dur="4.44">quadratic&apos;s taking Andy of course</text><text start="1636.86" dur="5.1">quadratic stating has its own drawbacks</text><text start="1639.32" dur="5.959">so I I mean the main downside of the</text><text start="1641.96" dur="6.42">quadratic staking is its exclusivity</text><text start="1645.279" dur="5.28">it&apos;s an advanced version of linear</text><text start="1648.38" dur="4.919">staking but unfortunately</text><text start="1650.559" dur="5.381">the monetary component of unique</text><text start="1653.299" dur="7.201">identity just filters you know excludes</text><text start="1655.94" dur="4.56">some some people and</text><text start="1660.7" dur="6.099">you know a fully inclusive from</text><text start="1663.62" dur="5.64">democratic system where every person uh</text><text start="1666.799" dur="5.221">has equal income and equal rights</text><text start="1669.26" dur="6.12">is a subject of current correction and</text><text start="1672.02" dur="6.539">uh I think that it&apos;s an unachievable and</text><text start="1675.38" dur="5.88">idealistic and it Opera unfortunately</text><text start="1678.559" dur="6.24">so the quadratic staking is a kind of a</text><text start="1681.26" dur="5.58">compromise between between two extremes</text><text start="1684.799" dur="4.461">like a capitalistic</text><text start="1686.84" dur="6.78">system that doesn&apos;t take into account</text><text start="1689.26" dur="7.779">identity and communist system that</text><text start="1693.62" dur="6.96">denies the role of private cargo</text><text start="1697.039" dur="5.581">right so I mean I I&apos;m it seems like it&apos;s</text><text start="1700.58" dur="4.199">a way of talking uh of staking your</text><text start="1702.62" dur="4.08">tokens wherein</text><text start="1704.779" dur="4.621">um the amount of tokens in the voting</text><text start="1706.7" dur="4.2">power that you get from staking is a</text><text start="1709.4" dur="3.72">square root of the amount of tokens so</text><text start="1710.9" dur="5.34">it&apos;s more democratic than a full</text><text start="1713.12" dur="6.059">one-to-one token system right uh one</text><text start="1716.24" dur="5.1">human one vote is it&apos;s not fully on that</text><text start="1719.179" dur="5.761">spectrum and you know my experience with</text><text start="1721.34" dur="5.459">quadratic funding quadratic voting uh is</text><text start="1724.94" dur="4.26">via get coin and one of the things we&apos;ve</text><text start="1726.799" dur="5.281">always thought was was really powerful</text><text start="1729.2" dur="4.74">about quadratic funding is that it gives</text><text start="1732.08" dur="3.479">the people with more Capital more of a</text><text start="1733.94" dur="3.54">voice and an incentive to give more of</text><text start="1735.559" dur="3.48">their Capital but it doesn&apos;t give them</text><text start="1737.48" dur="4.319">one-to-one it gives them a square root</text><text start="1739.039" dur="4.26">like a decaying uh more influence for</text><text start="1741.799" dur="3.12">putting in more Capital which is a way</text><text start="1743.299" dur="3.661">of waiting the whole system on some</text><text start="1744.919" dur="3.421">towards the poor the many over the rich</text><text start="1746.96" dur="4.56">and the few but still giving the rich</text><text start="1748.34" dur="4.5">people an incentive to participate do</text><text start="1751.52" dur="3.42">you see any sort of symmetries between</text><text start="1752.84" dur="3.18">quadratic staking and quadratic funding</text><text start="1754.94" dur="3.9">there</text><text start="1756.02" dur="5.519">yeah absolutely actually uh the</text><text start="1758.84" dur="7.199">quadratic uh staking idea was fully</text><text start="1761.539" dur="7.62">inherent from uh Glen whale ideas about</text><text start="1766.039" dur="6.081">writing voting and and quadratic funding</text><text start="1769.159" dur="6.661">proposed by vitalik</text><text start="1772.12" dur="6.7">and yeah and I I mean it&apos;s very</text><text start="1775.82" dur="6.66">important uh concept and the more</text><text start="1778.82" dur="6.12">projects follow this concept the the</text><text start="1782.48" dur="5.04">more civil resistant the Holocaust</text><text start="1784.94" dur="5.28">systems can be you know because</text><text start="1787.52" dur="6.899">otherwise if you just you know consider</text><text start="1790.22" dur="7.439">the identities like like</text><text start="1794.419" dur="6.661">now identities without Stakes like uh</text><text

dur="6.961">kids can do you know these tests uh even</text><text start="2059.56" dur="5.64">if you get difficult difficult flip</text><text start="2062.32" dur="5.4">during the ceremony where you cannot</text><text start="2065.2" dur="6.419">identify the right answer it&apos;s most</text><text start="2067.72" dur="6.06">likely will be disqualified by uh by the</text><text start="2071.619" dur="4.921">consensus because other people who also</text><text start="2073.78" dur="6.0">cannot solve this flip they will vote</text><text start="2076.54" dur="4.74">randomly and will not be able you know</text><text start="2079.78" dur="3.3">the committee will not be able to reach</text><text start="2081.28" dur="4.5">the consensus about the right answer and</text><text start="2083.08" dur="6.0">the flip will be disqualified and the</text><text start="2085.78" dur="4.98">author of this clip flip will be kind of</text><text start="2089.08" dur="4.319">uh</text><text start="2090.76" dur="4.98">the the author will just lose some</text><text start="2093.399" dur="6.781">rewards and because of that</text><text start="2095.74" dur="7.92">uh so yeah this is pretty much uh it</text><text start="2100.18" dur="6.84">about the the ceremony and we have this</text><text start="2103.66" dur="6.06">ceremony like on a regular basis and the</text><text start="2107.02" dur="4.079">uh the Epic duration depends on the</text><text start="2109.72" dur="4.08">network size</text><text start="2111.099" dur="4.921">the the larger the network the less</text><text start="2113.8" dur="6.24">frequently ceremony</text><text start="2116.02" dur="5.94">um take place so uh and yeah um this</text><text start="2120.04" dur="3.84">much this is pretty much</text><text start="2121.96" dur="5.22">um</text><text start="2123.88" dur="5.4">um about the the ceremony itself so let</text><text start="2127.18" dur="3.659">me know if it makes sense yeah</text><text start="2129.28" dur="3.36">well I remember participating in the</text><text start="2130.839" dur="3.721">ceremony and this might have been last</text><text start="2132.64" dur="4.8">summer that I participated in one but I</text><text start="2134.56" dur="4.86">if I recall it was a</text><text start="2137.44" dur="3.48">um it was every two weeks the ceremonies</text><text start="2139.42" dur="3.06">were happening back then does that seem</text><text start="2140.92" dur="4.5">like the right time interval</text><text start="2142.48" dur="5.4">yeah that&apos;s right it&apos;s uh it was uh two</text><text start="2145.42" dur="4.86">weeks it&apos;s it&apos;s as I said it&apos;s a</text><text start="2147.88" dur="5.4">function of the network size</text><text start="2150.28" dur="5.54">and it&apos;s always like happens at the same</text><text start="2153.28" dur="6.299">time and you know</text><text start="2155.82" dur="6.279">it&apos;s it happens like</text><text start="2159.579" dur="7.621">um early in the morning for the uh for</text><text start="2162.099" dur="8.52">the America and late at night for the uh</text><text start="2167.2" dur="6.419">for the Asia and it&apos;s like they it&apos;s</text><text start="2170.619" dur="4.861">like one 1 30 p.m UTC time</text><text start="2173.619" dur="3.48">which is the date you know for your</text><text start="2175.48" dur="3.54">opinions</text><text start="2177.099" dur="3.601">yeah and I recall</text><text start="2179.02" dur="3.48">um basically getting online and then</text><text start="2180.7" dur="3.0">opening up I think it was an ideena</text><text start="2182.5" dur="5.099">website or it might have been an</text><text start="2183.7" dur="6.0">application and then for 10 or 15 or 20</text><text start="2187.599" dur="3.901">minutes I can&apos;t recall solving a series</text><text start="2189.7" dur="3.96">of these flips and I remember thinking</text><text start="2191.5" dur="5.099">that they do kind of feel like captchas</text><text start="2193.66" dur="5.1">in a way and</text><text start="2196.599" dur="4.861">I I know that I passed the ceremony and</text><text start="2198.76" dur="4.8">I was part of the uh the registry for a</text><text start="2201.46" dur="3.48">little while after that which was cool I</text><text start="2203.56" dur="3.0">can&apos;t remember if I got any tokens for</text><text start="2204.94" dur="2.94">doing it but</text><text start="2206.56" dur="3.72">um but yeah</text><text start="2207.88" dur="6.6">um go ahead</text><text start="2210.28" dur="6.42">yeah uh actually uh yeah the thing is</text><text start="2214.48" dur="4.379">that the identity is not forever so it</text><text start="2216.7" dur="4.98">just lasts for until the next validation</text><text start="2218.859" dur="5.22">so if you&apos;re if you you can you can</text><text start="2221.68" dur="4.32">actually miss up to two validations in a</text><text start="2224.079" dur="3.26">row and then your identity got</text><text start="2226.0" dur="5.28">terminated</text><text start="2227.339" dur="5.861">and uh once you get verified once you</text><text start="2231.28" dur="2.78">get validated with this ceremony you can</text><text start="2233.2" dur="4.379">run</text><text start="2234.06" dur="4.84">your node and you know get some kind of</text><text start="2237.579" dur="4.02">coins for that</text><text start="2238.9" dur="5.64">and the validation itself can be run</text><text start="2241.599" dur="7.561">both on um on you know desktop version</text><text start="2244.54" dur="6.9">of the uh adding up or we recently</text><text start="2249.16" dur="5.28">developed maybe it was like a year ago</text><text start="2251.44" dur="6.0">we we just deployed the web version so</text><text start="2254.44" dur="6.419">it&apos;s available on the browser so you can</text><text start="2257.44" dur="6.72">just connect to any shared node that</text><text start="2260.859" dur="6.661">provide Now by provided by the community</text><text start="2264.16" dur="5.04">and and you can&apos;t even run it on your</text><text start="2267.52" dur="3.599">mobile you know which is really nice so</text><text start="2269.2" dur="4.08">you can do the validations</text><text start="2271.119" dur="3.361">um Wherever You Are</text><text start="2273.28" dur="2.579">yeah</text><text start="2274.48" dur="3.78">well you know the one thing I did after</text><text start="2275.859" dur="4.681">I went through the ceremony was I went</text><text start="2278.26" dur="5.579">on to the get coin website and I</text><text start="2280.54" dur="5.28">verified my identity uh on bitcoin so I</text><text start="2283.839" dur="4.681">could get more matching so it was neat</text><text start="2285.82" dur="4.86">to see get coin and Idina interoperate</text><text start="2288.52" dur="5.339">in in that way</text><text start="2290.68" dur="7.1">yeah that&apos;s true actually uh now we have</text><text start="2293.859" dur="6.5">uh the git coin passport right uh and uh</text><text start="2297.78" dur="5.799">uh we we actually</text><text start="2300.359" dur="4.74">submitted the pull request uh to get</text><text start="2303.579" dur="4.921">that</text><text start="2305.099" dur="7.301">integration with the Bitcoin passport as</text><text start="2308.5" dur="5.82">well nice yeah cool</text><text start="2312.4" dur="3.959">um</text><text start="2314.32" dur="3.299">well you know um I I&apos;m curious if</text><text start="2316.359" dur="4.441">there&apos;s anything anything I didn&apos;t ask</text><text start="2317.619" dur="6.301">that you want to say uh about Idina</text><text start="2320.8" dur="4.44">um I I think that uh you know I I think</text><text start="2323.92" dur="3.54">it&apos;s really neat to see a bunch of</text><text start="2325.24" dur="5.16">different pluralistic ways of creating</text><text start="2327.46" dur="5.76">more civil resistance uh</text><text start="2330.4" dur="4.679">uh work together and and build this</text><text start="2333.22" dur="3.78">ecosystem so I&apos;m curious if there&apos;s</text><text start="2335.079" dur="3.321">anything that that I didn&apos;t ask that you</text><text start="2337.0" dur="3.96">want to say</text><text start="2338.4" dur="6.219">uh probably I would I would like to</text><text start="2340.96" dur="6.0">explain a bit about uh our anonymity I</text><text start="2344.619" dur="5.581">think it&apos;s a very important part of you</text><text start="2346.96" dur="5.639">know idea project right and I have first</text><text start="2350.2" dur="5.04">of all I wanted to say thank you Kevin</text><text start="2352.599" dur="5.76">for inviting us even</text><text start="2355.24" dur="5.64">um regardless on our annuity and it&apos;s</text><text start="2358.359" dur="4.26">it&apos;s also it&apos;s it&apos;s the first time we</text><text start="2360.88" dur="3.979">speak in public that way</text><text start="2362.619" dur="5.281">and um</text><text start="2364.859" dur="6.341">uh actually we committed to stay on the</text><text start="2367.9" dur="5.64">animals inspired by Satoshi and</text><text start="2371.2" dur="5.28">as well as in Bitcoin we didn&apos;t make any</text><text start="2373.54" dur="5.64">Ico so the project is fully open source</text><text start="2376.48" dur="4.68">and anyone can follow and contribute</text><text start="2379.18" dur="5.399">and the main reason why we stay</text><text start="2381.16" dur="6.12">Anonymous is uh we wanted to minimize</text><text start="2384.579" dur="4.861">our influence on the protocol so we want</text><text start="2387.28" dur="4.02">the community to decide about the</text><text start="2389.44" dur="3.6">protocol values</text><text start="2391.3" dur="4.799">and I think it&apos;s very important the</text><text start="2393.04" dur="4.76">feeling when community members just now</text><text start="2396.099" dur="4.861">feel</text><text start="2397.8" dur="6.22">in charge of protocol changes</text><text start="2400.96" dur="7.02">you know we are as a team we cannot make</text><text start="2404.02" dur="6.36">any simple changes in a protocol so we</text><text start="2407.98" dur="5.34">cannot deploy any hard work without</text><text start="2410.38" dur="6.36">community support because the validators</text><text start="2413.32" dur="6.96">who control the network and users who</text><text start="2416.74" dur="4.339">uses who use the system are the same</text><text start="2420.28" dur="5.22">people</text><text start="2421.079" dur="7.481">so we are very thankful to our community</text><text start="2425.5" dur="5.7">for their activity and involvement into</text><text start="2428.56" dur="6.48">the protocol governance and I want to</text><text start="2431.2" dur="6.36">say a special thanks to all our old guys</text><text start="2435.04" dur="4.44">I want to say that we hear you we do our</text><text start="2437.56" dur="3.18">best to follow your discussions and read</text><text start="2439.48" dur="4.02">your comments</text><text start="2440.74" dur="4.859">and thank you for staying out with us</text><text start="2443.5" dur="2.88">for such a long time really appreciate</text><text start="2445.599" dur="3.301">that</text><text start="2446.38" dur="4.86">and I will really share your passion</text><text start="2448.9" dur="5.48">about building democracy and sustainable</text><text start="2451.24" dur="3.14">civil resistance</text><text start="2454.72" dur="5.58">yeah well you know I do think that</text><text start="2456.76" dur="5.04">there&apos;s there&apos;s really an important I</text><text start="2460.3" dur="4.08">don&apos;t want to say trade-off but I want</text><text start="2461.8" dur="4.2">to say a design criteria of creating</text><text start="2464.38" dur="4.26">actual civil resistance but still</text><text start="2466.0" dur="4.68">protecting privacy I think that</text><text start="2468.64" dur="4.439">yeah that&apos;s a really important thing to</text><text start="2470.68" dur="5.34">that you just can&apos;t bolt on at at the</text><text start="2473.079" dur="5.941">end and of the</text><text start="2476.02" dur="5.4">uh of the the mechanisms that Brian Ford</text><text start="2479.02" dur="6.42">told us about presence-based biometric</text><text start="2481.42" dur="6.12">kyc and web of trust it feels like</text><text start="2485.44" dur="3.84">there&apos;s a lot of in that trade-off space</text><text start="2487.54" dur="4.38">privacy concerns that I really have</text><text start="2489.28" dur="3.839">concerns about with kyc and Biometrics</text><text start="2491.92" dur="2.88">and I think relying totally on</text><text start="2493.119" dur="3.541">presence-based</text><text start="2494.8" dur="4.14">um in web of trust is a really elegant</text><text start="2496.66" dur="4.679">way of creating more civil resistance</text><text start="2498.94" dur="4.62">but but also maintaining privacy and</text><text start="2501.339" dur="3.481">y&apos;all y&apos;all are uh it seems like y&apos;all</text><text start="2503.56" dur="3.96">are doing it and the fact that you&apos;re in</text><text start="2504.82" dur="4.14">on yourself as the founder I I think is</text><text start="2507.52" dur="3.48">uh</text><text start="2508.96" dur="3.659">um is an interesting fact pattern that</text><text start="2511.0" dur="3.54">that supports the Privacy at the base</text><text start="2512.619" dur="4.261">layer so</text><text start="2514.54" dur="3.78">um yeah I mean is there anything else is</text><text start="2516.88" dur="4.76">there any other sort of important design</text><text start="2518.32" dur="3.32">criteria that you want to tell us about</text><text start="2521.92" dur="6.56">um yeah I would I would also uh like to</text><text start="2524.98" dur="6.3">tell a bit about the use cases of uh</text><text start="2528.48" dur="5.56">human-centric blockchains in general you</text><text start="2531.28" dur="7.799">know yeah because there are some that</text><text start="2534.04" dur="8.819">are really on the surface surface but uh</text><text start="2539.079" dur="6.421">um like you know like votings dollars</text><text start="2542.859" dur="5.461">air drops quadratic Road in quadratic</text><text start="2545.5" dur="5.82">funding you know ubis</text><text start="2548.32" dur="4.08">and actually now we have quadratic</text><text start="2551.32" dur="4.56">staking</text><text start="2552.4" dur="6.24">and we have Idina as the uh as a</text><text start="2555.88" dur="5.94">blockchain is also the use case for uh</text><text start="2558.64" dur="6.6">for Unique identity primitive</text><text start="2561.82" dur="6.2">but we also have many things to discover</text><text start="2565.24" dur="8.04">and I would like to name a few of them</text><text start="2568.02" dur="7.42">or for example let&apos;s see on chain ads</text><text start="2573.28" dur="5.819">uh you know we do experiment with that</text><text start="2575.44" dur="5.78">and nobody likes us but on chain as is a</text><text start="2579.099" dur="4.98">different concept</text><text start="2581.22" dur="5.859">and it&apos;s something that you know you</text><text start="2584.079" dur="6.181">just publish on chain and anyone anybody</text><text start="2587.079" dur="5.28">can you know pull that out and just view</text><text start="2590.26" dur="5.16">that ads and we build it kind of free</text><text start="2592.359" dur="4.26">the protocol based on self-targeted ads</text><text start="2595.42" dur="3.54">you know so</text><text start="2596.619" dur="4.441">um and I think it&apos;s a huge Market you</text><text start="2598.96" dur="4.98">know that still doesn&apos;t exist on chain</text><text start="2601.06" dur="5.94">which is a really really interesting and</text><text start="2603.94" dur="5.159">it can only work with the uh unique</text><text start="2607.0" dur="5.22">identity primitive</text><text start="2609.099" dur="6.841">then interesting uh idea is about the</text><text start="2612.22" dur="6.599">content moderation uh this also we we do</text><text start="2615.94" dur="5.639">some experiments with that we use</text><text start="2618.819" dur="4.921">randomly selected human oracles for the</text><text start="2621.579" dur="3.901">Arts moderation</text><text start="2623.74" dur="4.5">and um</text><text start="2625.48" dur="5.339">probably another version of that we</text><text start="2628.24" dur="5.64">could experiment with the uh you know</text><text start="2630.819" dur="5.881">fake news analysis like it&apos;s it&apos;s a</text><text start="2633.88" dur="5.34">subject to explore but yeah probably</text><text start="2636.7" dur="4.98">could make some experiments with that</text><text start="2639.22" dur="4.02">yeah and is there an ecosystem of people</text><text start="2641.68" dur="4.8">that are building these type of things</text><text start="2643.24" dur="4.2">on on top of Adina tell me about the</text><text start="2646.48" dur="4.56">community</text><text start="2647.44" dur="7.8">yeah we already have a you know</text><text start="2651.04" dur="6.66">uh building uh into the clients uh the</text><text start="2655.24" dur="5.46">Oracle voting system so if you&apos;re</text><text start="2657.7" dur="5.46">validated uh identity then you just can</text><text start="2660.7" dur="4.919">participate in the Oracle votings you</text><text start="2663.16" dur="5.159">can run your own votings you know and</text><text start="2665.619" dur="4.561">it&apos;s a kind of civil resistant warnings</text><text start="2668.319" dur="3.961">uh were</text><text start="2670.18" dur="5.159">you can do you know different things</text><text start="2672.28" dur="4.86">like you can ask you know participant to</text><text start="2675.339" dur="5.221">stake something you know before they</text><text start="2677.14" dur="6.179">vote before they publish their role uh</text><text start="2680.56" dur="5.279">and yeah so and</text><text start="2683.319" dur="6.361">or you can just pay for for some you</text><text start="2685.839" dur="5.52">know polls asking their opinions</text><text start="2689.68" dur="4.8">um so yeah all this stuff is already</text><text start="2691.359" dur="6.0">there so we we run you can even you know</text><text start="2694.48" dur="5.18">lock some coins you know based and and</text><text start="2697.359" dur="5.881">unlock the coins based on</text><text start="2699.66" dur="5.5">oracles uh decision which are you know</text><text start="2703.24" dur="4.5">so that oracles are just randomly</text><text start="2705.16" dur="4.98">selected from the network and they can</text><text start="2707.74" dur="5.76">decide you know whether to unlock the</text><text start="2710.14" dur="5.1">coins or just make keep them locked this</text><text start="2713.5" dur="5.04">is actually the the interesting</text><text start="2715.24" dur="4.52">primitive that we we uh anticipate you</text><text start="2718.54" dur="4.5">know to use</text><text start="2719.76" dur="5.5">uh in order to implement a kind of</text><text start="2723.04" dur="4.079">decentralized git coin you know so</text><text start="2725.26" dur="5.3">decentralized common good finding</text><text start="2727.119" dur="6.121">platform we actually have a</text><text start="2730.56" dur="6.4">so-called zero wallet in Arduino</text><text start="2733.24" dur="4.98">protocol where portion of inflation is</text><text start="2736.96" dur="3.84">getting locked</text><text start="2738.22" dur="5.58">and it&apos;s really big challenge how to
