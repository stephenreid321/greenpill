episode we are</text><text start="7.2" dur="5.46">talking about the get coin grants</text><text start="9.559" dur="5.561">decentralized Alpha round so a quadratic</text><text start="12.66" dur="4.26">funding round hosted by getcoin on the</text><text start="15.12" dur="5.7">completely new decentralized modular</text><text start="16.92" dur="6.18">protocol that gitcoin has built so uh on</text><text start="20.82" dur="5.82">this episode we&apos;ve got Connor and Janine</text><text start="23.1" dur="5.16">from the Partnerships team on at Bitcoin</text><text start="26.64" dur="5.1">and we&apos;ve got Nate from the product team</text><text start="28.26" dur="5.52">on gitcoin and we are talking in this in</text><text start="31.74" dur="5.46">this episode about the one million</text><text start="33.78" dur="6.18">dollar Alpha round for uh climate web 3</text><text start="37.2" dur="5.1">projects eth infra web3 projects and</text><text start="39.96" dur="5.58">web3 open source that is happening from</text><text start="42.3" dur="5.7">January 17th to the 31st so this episode</text><text start="45.54" dur="5.76">will air on January 17th the date that</text><text start="48.0" dur="5.28">the round is has started and the reason</text><text start="51.3" dur="3.899">that we have this episode is that we</text><text start="53.28" dur="4.919">wanted to talk about bitcoin&apos;s Evolution</text><text start="55.199" dur="5.581">into the protocol uh we wanted to tell</text><text start="58.199" dur="4.081">you about the the first Alpha Protocol</text><text start="60.78" dur="4.019">round that is happening on top of grand</text><text start="62.28" dur="4.32">chance stack and the allocation protocol</text><text start="64.799" dur="4.14">so that means no more sign in with</text><text start="66.6" dur="4.019">GitHub no more centralized platform this</text><text start="68.939" dur="3.841">is a modular decentralized code base</text><text start="70.619" dur="3.841">that anyone can fork and give their</text><text start="72.78" dur="4.62">Community flexibility on how they</text><text start="74.46" dur="4.92">allocate their resources much simpler ux</text><text start="77.4" dur="4.62">and much more elegant technical</text><text start="79.38" dur="4.559">architecture so uh disclosure on this</text><text start="82.02" dur="3.959">episode I am a co-founder of getcoin but</text><text start="83.939" dur="5.04">have since disaffiliated since it&apos;s</text><text start="85.979" dur="5.221">become a dow I hold GTC I hold eth and I</text><text start="88.979" dur="4.381">hold die these are tokens involved in</text><text start="91.2" dur="4.14">building the ethereum ecosystem on</text><text start="93.36" dur="3.6">bitcoin that is not why we do this</text><text start="95.34" dur="3.779">episode we do it because we&apos;re excited</text><text start="96.96" dur="4.44">about quadratic funding on git coin</text><text start="99.119" dur="3.901">Bitcoin has created 72 million dollars</text><text start="101.4" dur="3.539">worth of public goods funding for the</text><text start="103.02" dur="4.68">ethereum ecosystem many of you listeners</text><text start="104.939" dur="5.161">have gotten money or given money on get</text><text start="107.7" dur="5.52">coin grants and</text><text start="110.1" dur="6.6">um yeah so uh we&apos;re just really excited</text><text start="113.22" dur="5.219">to see this Alpha round launching and</text><text start="116.7" dur="3.72">um and and basically quick primer on</text><text start="118.439" dur="4.561">quadratic funding if you&apos;re not familiar</text><text start="120.42" dur="6.299">already quadratic funding is based a way</text><text start="123.0" dur="6.119">of allocating a matching pool to the</text><text start="126.719" dur="4.801">results of a crowdfunding campaign and</text><text start="129.119" dur="4.321">so during this two weeks between the</text><text start="131.52" dur="3.06">17th of January and the 31st of January</text><text start="133.44" dur="2.7">there&apos;ll be a one million dollar</text><text start="134.58" dur="3.78">matching pool that will be allocated to</text><text start="136.14" dur="5.76">the results of a crowdfunding campaign</text><text start="138.36" dur="5.4">and during that round the matching will</text><text start="141.9" dur="3.72">happen quadratically which is basically</text><text start="143.76" dur="3.6">a mathy way of saying the number of</text><text start="145.62" dur="4.32">contributors to each Grant matters more</text><text start="147.36" dur="4.739">than the amount funded for each Grant</text><text start="149.94" dur="3.54">and that&apos;s what quadratic funding is</text><text start="152.099" dur="2.961">it&apos;s actually a really powerful way of</text><text start="153.48" dur="3.6">pushing power to the edges</text><text start="155.06" dur="3.819">decentralizing and creating more</text><text start="157.08" dur="3.96">democratic way of allocating funding in</text><text start="158.879" dur="4.981">the ethereum ecosystem but now really in</text><text start="161.04" dur="6.059">any ecosystem that uses the grant stack</text><text start="163.86" dur="4.739">and quadratic funding so uh there have</text><text start="167.099" dur="3.601">been many notable projects that have</text><text start="168.599" dur="4.201">been funded by Bitcoin the centralized</text><text start="170.7" dur="4.52">version in the past most notably uniswap</text><text start="172.8" dur="4.98">1 in 16s you&apos;re in finance</text><text start="175.22" dur="4.12">infrastructure projects like Prismatic</text><text start="177.78" dur="4.02">or Lighthouse have been funded by</text><text start="179.34" dur="4.619">Bitcoin in the past and I&apos;m really</text><text start="181.8" dur="4.74">excited see what projects get surfaced</text><text start="183.959" dur="3.601">in this next round of get coin quadratic</text><text start="186.54" dur="3.12">funding is kind of a collective</text><text start="187.56" dur="4.86">intelligence mechanism that lets you see</text><text start="189.66" dur="4.92">what the ethereum community is excited</text><text start="192.42" dur="3.959">about because what they&apos;re funding on</text><text start="194.58" dur="4.32">bitcoin is what they&apos;re excited about</text><text start="196.379" dur="4.261">and quadratic funding upregulates the</text><text start="198.9" dur="4.199">projects that the most people are most</text><text start="200.64" dur="4.08">excited about so this episode is a</text><text start="203.099" dur="4.021">banger if you&apos;re into quadratic funding</text><text start="204.72" dur="6.299">if you&apos;re in to get coins Evolution into</text><text start="207.12" dur="6.3">a decentralized modular protocol and Dao</text><text start="211.019" dur="3.841">then uh this episode is for you if</text><text start="213.42" dur="3.12">you&apos;re interested in contributing to the</text><text start="214.86" dur="4.019">one million dollar climate</text><text

it&apos;s</text><text start="370.08" dur="4.26">going to be the first test of the get</text><text start="371.759" dur="4.44">coin team runs on the protocol and the</text><text start="374.34" dur="4.799">three rounds are open source software</text><text start="376.199" dur="5.401">and we&apos;ve got each infrastructure and</text><text start="379.139" dur="5.221">then climate Solutions so we&apos;re really</text><text start="381.6" dur="4.86">excited to run these it&apos;s a curated all</text><text start="384.36" dur="5.88">three of them are curated rounds</text><text start="386.46" dur="6.48">with grantees that have previously done</text><text start="390.24" dur="4.56">rounds previously on the protocol</text><text start="392.94" dur="3.06">um on our product and are now going to</text><text start="394.8" dur="2.82">be the first ones testing out the</text><text start="396.0" dur="3.479">protocol with us so we&apos;re super stoked</text><text start="397.62" dur="5.04">about it and kind of when are we when</text><text start="399.479" dur="6.06">are we running them yeah so this round</text><text start="402.66" dur="4.92">kicks off tomorrow or today if or</text><text start="405.539" dur="3.301">yesterday in the past if it depending on</text><text start="407.58" dur="7.08">when you&apos;re watching this uh January</text><text start="408.84" dur="7.38">17th at uh 12 o&apos;clock UTC so earlier in</text><text start="414.66" dur="3.78">the morning for anyone in the U.S on</text><text start="416.22" dur="6.599">January 17th and it&apos;ll run until January</text><text start="418.44" dur="6.3">31st and one one addition I just add to</text><text start="422.819" dur="4.921">what Janine said is that this is</text><text start="424.74" dur="5.22">essentially kind of the first test round</text><text start="427.74" dur="4.679">of the git coin program or what will</text><text start="429.96" dur="4.019">evolve into the git coin program so the</text><text start="432.419" dur="3.361">thing about the new protocol is that</text><text start="433.979" dur="3.961">it&apos;s you know kind of fully</text><text start="435.78" dur="4.919">permissionless and self-service and</text><text start="437.94" dur="3.78">anyone can run their own qf round grant</text><text start="440.699" dur="3.9">program</text><text start="441.72" dur="5.52">um any type of sort of uh Grant</text><text start="444.599" dur="5.88">infrastructure uh in the future at any</text><text start="447.24" dur="4.92">time and git coin will kind of have our</text><text start="450.479" dur="3.72">own set of rounds that we run on a</text><text start="452.16" dur="5.34">recurring basis some that are you know</text><text start="454.199" dur="5.34">new some that get replaced uh but we</text><text start="457.5" dur="3.479">kind of plan to keep up our Cadence of</text><text start="459.539" dur="4.801">rounds that we&apos;ve been doing for a few</text><text start="460.979" dur="5.401">years now but on this new platform and</text><text start="464.34" dur="3.78">yeah so this is going to be like the</text><text start="466.38" dur="3.539">kind of first taste of what we plan to</text><text start="468.12" dur="3.12">run and then you know we&apos;re helping a</text><text start="469.919" dur="3.72">lot of other organizations kind of hop</text><text start="471.24" dur="3.959">on and and start using it as well and so</text><text start="473.639" dur="3.78">we&apos;re not going to be the only ones</text><text start="475.199" dur="3.801">running uh Grant programs and doing</text><text start="477.419" dur="4.441">quadratic funding on the on the protocol</text><text start="479.0" dur="5.38">uh but this is just the first uh the</text><text start="481.86" dur="4.2">first step towards you know us running</text><text start="484.38" dur="4.62">our program and then enabling everyone</text><text start="486.06" dur="5.4">else to run their own as well</text><text start="489.0" dur="5.28">right so listeners may be familiar with</text><text start="491.46" dur="8.34">Bitcoin grants rounds 1 through 15 that</text><text start="494.28" dur="7.74">ran from 20 January 2019 to late 2020 to</text><text start="499.8" dur="4.38">and it sounds like there&apos;s a whole new</text><text start="502.02" dur="5.399">platform that&apos;s decentralized and</text><text start="504.18" dur="5.16">modular that uh is being used to run</text><text start="507.419" dur="3.9">these rounds so what kind of product</text><text start="509.34" dur="4.319">differences can can people expect if</text><text start="511.319" dur="4.501">they&apos;re used to the old platform Nate</text><text start="513.659" dur="4.32">maybe this one&apos;s for you yeah yeah</text><text start="515.82" dur="4.2">definitely um so we&apos;re really excited</text><text start="517.979" dur="4.141">about uh the way that we&apos;re building out</text><text start="520.02" dur="4.379">the the new protocol and then also the</text><text start="522.12" dur="3.96">the platform and D apps on top of that I</text><text start="524.399" dur="3.361">I think one of the really interesting</text><text start="526.08" dur="4.14">things for us when we were working with</text><text start="527.76" dur="4.5">our old platform was just how much</text><text start="530.22" dur="3.36">customization people wanted like as</text><text start="532.26" dur="3.18">communities would come in they&apos;d be</text><text start="533.58" dur="4.439">really excited about the the core</text><text start="535.44" dur="4.019">concept of quadratic funding but then</text><text start="538.019" dur="4.141">they would want to have like their own</text><text start="539.459" dur="3.901">sort of take or on sort of tweaks that</text><text start="542.16" dur="4.26">really fit what they were trying to do</text><text start="543.36" dur="4.919">whether that was eligibility criteria or</text><text start="546.42" dur="3.78">wanting to give weight to different</text><text start="548.279" dur="3.841">types of Voters there&apos;s just a lot of</text><text start="550.2" dur="3.18">different things that go into how you as</text><text start="552.12" dur="3.42">a community decide how you want to</text><text start="553.38" dur="4.5">allocate your resources and the old</text><text start="555.54" dur="3.359">platform really can handle that so I</text><text start="557.88" dur="3.959">think the the thing that I&apos;m most</text><text start="558.899" dur="4.201">excited about when it comes to what</text><text start="561.839" dur="3.481">we&apos;re building today is just the</text><text start="563.1" dur="3.84">flexibility uh like we&apos;ve really been</text><text start="565.32" dur="3.3">identifying like what are the different</text><text start="566.94" dur="3.72">decision points that a community would</text><text start="568.62" dur="2.64">want to have in terms of</text><text start="570.66" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="571.26" dur="4.38">Distributing their their resources and</text><text start="574.08" dur="3.42">now like we&apos;re giving them the ability</text><text start="575.64" dur="4.02">to decide at every point of that like</text><text start="577.5" dur="4.2">what makes the most sense for them I</text><text start="579.66" dur="4.38">think in terms of the overall like app</text><text start="581.7" dur="4.62">that we&apos;ve built on top of it</text><text start="584.04" dur="4.919">um I think what people will probably see</text><text start="586.32" dur="4.62">is just it&apos;s it&apos;s much simpler like in</text><text start="588.959" dur="4.141">the old world there wasn&apos;t much of a</text><text start="590.94" dur="4.74">back end to speak of it required a lot</text><text start="593.1" dur="4.679">of like deep knowledge of our systems</text><text start="595.68" dur="4.08">for like an operator like Conor Janine</text><text start="597.779" dur="4.381">to come in and run around we&apos;ve really</text><text start="599.76" dur="4.199">been investing in that UI so that we</text><text start="602.16" dur="3.179">really can give it to</text><text start="603.959" dur="4.261">um to anyone who wants to run around and</text><text start="605.339" dur="4.021">they can log in they can configure make</text><text start="608.22" dur="2.46">all the choices that they want to make</text><text start="609.36" dur="3.599">around the round themselves and then</text><text start="610.68" dur="4.26">deploy it and operate it without needing</text><text start="612.959" dur="4.621">a big technical team or without really</text><text start="614.94" dur="4.38">needing to understand our stack at a a</text><text start="617.58" dur="2.759">high level</text><text start="619.32" dur="4.079">um I think the other thing that we&apos;ve</text><text start="620.339" dur="5.761">been doing on the uh more like donor</text><text start="623.399" dur="5.421">facing and grantee facing side is</text><text start="626.1" dur="5.82">trying to streamline the overall</text><text start="628.82" dur="6.22">experience so I think the one big shift</text><text start="631.92" dur="5.88">was that on the old platform you could</text><text start="635.04" dur="5.4">come in for a specific round and donate</text><text start="637.8" dur="4.92">on a variety of chains you could donate</text><text start="640.44" dur="5.639">on mainnet you could use CK sync you</text><text start="642.72" dur="5.88">could donate on polygon we changed with</text><text start="646.079" dur="4.861">the protocol so that each round will run</text><text start="648.6" dur="5.179">on one chain it&apos;ll either you know run</text><text start="650.94" dur="6.12">on mainnet it&apos;ll run on L2</text><text start="653.779" dur="4.961">but I think what you sort of lose in</text><text start="657.06" dur="3.3">flexibility there I think you just gain</text><text start="658.74" dur="2.82">an ease of use from a grantee</text><text start="660.36" dur="3.38">perspective you don&apos;t have to worry</text><text start="661.56" dur="5.16">about porting over from different chains</text><text start="663.74" dur="6.039">from a donor perspective you have like</text><text start="666.72" dur="5.04">one clean kind of browsing experience so</text><text start="669.779" dur="4.141">I think we&apos;ve we&apos;ve definitely stripped</text><text start="671.76" dur="4.62">it down for this first Alpha Protocol</text><text start="673.92" dur="4.14">round but I think it&apos;s also given us a</text><text start="676.38" dur="3.42">really strong platform so that as we</text><text start="678.06" dur="3.42">start to get into these these next</text><text start="679.8" dur="3.5">rounds you&apos;ll start to see a lot more</text><text start="681.48" dur="4.14">experimentation on top of it in terms of</text><text start="683.3" dur="3.7">curation and sorting and things like</text><text start="685.62" dur="4.5">that so</text><text start="687.0" dur="5.94">um I&apos;m really excited for what&apos;s coming</text><text start="690.12" dur="6.48">got it so where it started was this this</text><text start="692.94" dur="5.7">platform that uh that was centralized in</text><text start="696.6" dur="3.54">monolithic and was hard to tune and</text><text start="698.64" dur="5.04">where it&apos;s going is decentralized</text><text start="700.14" dur="5.4">modular allows communities to uh because</text><text start="703.68" dur="4.62">of the Simplicity of the modular code</text><text start="705.54" dur="5.7">base tune it towards their own needs and</text><text start="708.3" dur="4.32">now anyone can kind of take quadratic</text><text start="711.24" dur="2.94">funding on bitcoin grants that was</text><text start="712.62" dur="5.88">working in ethereum and apply it to</text><text start="714.18" dur="6.3">their own Dao evm based Community is</text><text start="718.5" dur="3.42">that directionally correct yeah it&apos;s</text><text start="720.48" dur="3.9">exactly right</text><text start="721.92" dur="5.099">um I think we we as the Dow just like</text><text start="724.38" dur="4.199">really didn&apos;t want to be a a bottleneck</text><text start="727.019" dur="3.06">on quadratic funding rounds I think</text><text start="728.579" dur="4.021">there&apos;s just so many people who are</text><text start="730.079" dur="6.0">excited about doing that so this this</text><text start="732.6" dur="5.34">first expression of uh our protocol is</text><text start="736.079" dur="3.961">allowing anyone to come in and run a</text><text start="737.94" dur="3.66">quadratic funding round with</text><text start="740.04" dur="4.56">um civil defense with kind of like the</text><text start="741.6" dur="5.82">things that we&apos;ve become to known come</text><text start="744.6" dur="4.679">to be known for uh at Bitcoin uh and</text><text start="747.42" dur="3.84">then I think the Step Beyond this for us</text><text start="749.279" dur="3.361">is starting to just like add more and</text><text start="751.26" dur="4.74">more tools into that toolkit for</text><text start="752.64" dur="6.0">communities so adding in additional sort</text><text start="756.0" dur="4.32">of allocation uh flavors adding in</text><text start="758.64" dur="4.74">different tools things like that so</text><text start="760.32" dur="4.92">we&apos;re excited to see where it goes yeah</text><text start="763.38" dur="3.959">you said the the word allocation there</text><text start="765.24" dur="3.839">and it just triggered a thought in my in</text><text start="767.339" dur="3.24">my mind that on the governance Forum</text><text start="769.079" dur="4.801">there was some debates about what to</text><text start="770.579" dur="5.401">call these these protocols and uh is</text><text start="773.88" dur="4.199">there is there a final name for them yet</text><text start="775.98" dur="4.32">I think there is I hope I&apos;m not going to</text><text start="778.079" dur="4.26">get uh skewered for this but we&apos;re going</text><text start="780.3" dur="3.96">to be calling it The aloe protocol</text><text start="782.339" dur="3.781">um which I&apos;m really excited about it&apos;s</text><text start="784.26" dur="3.0">based in allocation uh just really</text><text start="786.12" dur="3.719">speaks to the things that we&apos;re trying</text><text start="787.26" dur="4.44">to do uh with this protocol</text><text start="789.839" dur="3.841">um and then we&apos;ve been building out a</text><text start="791.7" dur="3.18">series of of apps on top of that that</text><text start="793.68" dur="3.24">we&apos;re calling the grant stack and that&apos;s</text><text start="794.88" dur="3.66">what anyone can come in to use</text><text start="796.92" dur="3.419">um to run quadratic funding rounds or do</text><text start="798.54" dur="3.359">whatever they want but the aloe protocol</text><text start="800.339" dur="3.481">is really the the engine under the hood</text><text start="801.899" dur="3.301">that we&apos;re also hoping becomes a a</text><text start="803.82" dur="3.6">really strong foundation for Builders</text><text start="805.2" dur="5.16">who are interested in um you know</text><text start="807.42" dur="4.68">community-based fund allocation</text><text start="810.36" dur="3.539">uh so you said that anyone can come in</text><text start="812.1" dur="4.799">and run around I see in my notes here</text><text start="813.899" dur="5.161">that y&apos;all have run two test rounds on</text><text start="816.899" dur="4.081">the protocol to date with UNICEF and</text><text start="819.06" dur="3.42">Phantom Janine and Connor you want to</text><text start="820.98" dur="4.2">talk about those results</text><text start="822.48" dur="5.52">yeah I mean I I think it was like we did</text><text start="825.18" dur="5.399">those into Samba um so we had a two-week</text><text start="828.0" dur="4.8">round for Unicef and then Phantom had a</text><text start="830.579" dur="3.901">much longer round Phantom actually ran</text><text start="832.8" dur="3.96">their own around themselves so it was</text><text start="834.48" dur="5.7">like a very self-service way of doing it</text><text start="836.76" dur="5.46">whereas UNICEF we worked with them and</text><text start="840.18" dur="3.839">did a lot of the operations and engaging</text><text start="842.22" dur="5.64">the grantees and engaging the donors</text><text start="844.019" dur="6.421">both I would say were successes</text><text start="847.86" dur="4.86">um the UNICEF round we had them put up</text><text start="850.44" dur="4.8">50 each in the matching pool and really</text><text start="852.72" dur="5.64">what they wanted out of it was like how</text><text start="855.24" dur="5.339">can we start using crypto to help you</text><text start="858.36" dur="5.219">know projects that were already funding</text><text start="860.579" dur="6.481">um and how can we help our community get</text><text start="863.579" dur="5.221">engaged and also like feel empowered to</text><text start="867.06" dur="3.899">both donate to the grantees and the</text><text start="868.8" dur="4.38">grantees being able to you know rely on</text><text start="870.959" dur="3.721">their communities to donate to them and</text><text start="873.18" dur="3.899">it was just a big success across the</text><text start="874.68" dur="4.02">board like you know Nate and the product</text><text start="877.079" dur="5.341">team has been doing a great job building</text><text start="878.7" dur="6.9">the protocols we sped up the launch of</text><text start="882.42" dur="4.74">testing these protocols for a partner</text><text start="885.6" dur="4.56">instead of running with the UNICEF</text><text start="887.16" dur="4.919">Innovation team was not a small feat to</text><text start="890.16" dur="4.14">start with but it all went pretty</text><text start="892.079" dur="5.281">smoothly they had 10 grantees in the</text><text start="894.3" dur="5.52">round so the interesting thing is the</text><text start="897.36" dur="4.38">UNICEF round was a curated round</text><text start="899.82" dur="3.92">um they brought in grantees that they</text><text start="901.74" dur="4.5">knew and trusted and wanted to support</text><text start="903.74" dur="4.24">and I think that worked really well just</text><text start="906.24" dur="2.76">to like learn about the protocol for</text><text start="907.98" dur="3.12">them</text><text start="909.0" dur="3.899">um and we ended up you know more than</text><text start="911.1" dur="5.099">doubling the amount of funds that they</text><text start="912.899" dur="7.021">put in so we had a total of 80 Ethan</text><text start="916.199" dur="4.981">Edition that came from 15 500 donors for</text><text start="919.92" dur="3.719">that round</text><text start="921.18" dur="4.74">and I was sort of donations that came in</text><text start="923.639" dur="4.14">over a</text><text start="925.92" dur="4.38">two-week period that went to the 10</text><text start="927.779" dur="4.381">different grantees we had someone from</text><text start="930.3" dur="4.02">our community build a great Dune</text><text start="932.16" dur="4.02">dashboard that sort of tracked all the</text><text start="934.32" dur="3.42">funding and how it was you know being</text><text start="936.18" dur="2.7">distributed which was awesome to follow</text><text start="937.74" dur="3.12">along with</text><text start="938.88" dur="4.259">um and the grantees themselves some of</text><text start="940.86" dur="4.14">them had never used crypto before some</text><text start="943.139" dur="4.741">of them you know are blockchain based</text><text start="945.0" dur="5.339">projects and it was really cool seeing</text><text start="947.88" dur="4.259">the non-crypto native ones being like oh</text><text start="950.339" dur="3.421">whoa like I can do this like this is how</text><text start="952.139" dur="3.601">I create a wallet this is how I engage</text><text start="953.76" dur="3.6">my community some of them around their</text><text start="955.74" dur="3.12">own Twitter spaces</text><text start="957.36" dur="4.56">um so it was just like really cool</text><text start="958.86" dur="6.96">seeing how we&apos;re actually using these</text><text start="961.92" dur="6.479">protocols to empower communities to fund</text><text start="965.82" dur="4.8">you know their own projects and them</text><text start="968.399" dur="4.5">feeling empowered to actually do that</text><text start="970.62" dur="3.719">themselves without Bitcoin necessarily</text><text start="972.899" dur="5.401">doing all of that work in the background</text><text start="974.339" dur="7.321">so that was awesome to see for Unicef</text><text start="978.3" dur="5.46">and then the Phantom round was a great</text><text start="981.66" dur="3.66">one to launch and kind of see what</text><text start="983.76" dur="3.66">happened there because that was more</text><text start="985.32" dur="3.48">self-service so Nate might actually be</text><text start="987.42" dur="3.779">able to speak to a little bit of like</text><text start="988.8" dur="4.62">how we set that round up and how we sort</text><text start="991.199" dur="4.621">of just let them do their own thing</text><text start="993.42" dur="4.08">yeah yeah it&apos;s a phantom approaches</text><text start="995.82" dur="2.819">pretty early on</text><text start="997.5" dur="3.0">um as we were building out the protocol</text><text start="998.639" dur="4.38">expressing an interest in and being an</text><text start="1000.5" dur="4.5">early test partner I think we had Conor</text><text start="1003.019" dur="3.601">had had a ton of conversations with them</text><text start="1005.0" dur="3.48">um in kind of our centralized grants</text><text start="1006.62" dur="3.18">days uh and they were just that</text><text start="1008.48" dur="3.24">Community has been one that&apos;s just been</text><text start="1009.8" dur="4.08">really excited about quadratic funding</text><text start="1011.72" dur="4.2">um in general and when it came to start</text><text start="1013.88" dur="3.72">testing things out they were just kind</text><text start="1015.92" dur="3.479">of the the ideal partner they were</text><text start="1017.6" dur="3.12">really willing to</text><text start="1019.399" dur="2.821">um get in the weeds with us like</text><text start="1020.72" dur="2.22">understand</text><text start="1022.22" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="1022.94" dur="4.619">you know how we wanted to build it</text><text start="1025.1" dur="3.9">understand like how to get feedback and</text><text start="1027.559" dur="3.601">just really be there as we were trying</text><text start="1029.0" dur="4.26">to to work things through and I think</text><text start="1031.16" dur="3.12">they were really excited just as this</text><text start="1033.26" dur="3.179">feels like the beginning of something</text><text start="1034.28" dur="4.2">for them uh you know they they ran</text><text start="1036.439" dur="3.181">initial test rounds they&apos;d put up about</text><text start="1038.48" dur="3.9">35</text><text start="1039.62" dur="5.339">000 uh USD in their matching pool</text><text start="1042.38" dur="4.559">um I think it was a 125 000 uh FTM</text><text start="1044.959" dur="4.021">tokens they ended up getting over 80</text><text start="1046.939" dur="3.301">projects uh accepted into the round</text><text start="1048.98" dur="3.12">which was great</text><text start="1050.24" dur="4.98">um given that it was a</text><text start="1052.1" dur="5.22">just kind of an early start for them</text><text start="1055.22" dur="5.88">um and then in terms of donations they</text><text start="1057.32" dur="6.06">had over 16 000 uh unique donors they</text><text start="1061.1" dur="4.8">also got about 80 000 in direct</text><text start="1063.38" dur="3.72">donations so they almost tripled</text><text start="1065.9" dur="2.88">um the amount that they put up in the</text><text start="1067.1" dur="3.3">matching funds which was just really</text><text start="1068.78" dur="3.18">exciting to see</text><text start="1070.4" dur="3.3">um and they&apos;re looking at this as a way</text><text start="1071.96" dur="3.36">to you know continue iterating and build</text><text start="1073.7" dur="3.18">from here I think one of the things</text><text start="1075.32" dur="3.3">that&apos;s been really exciting for us too</text><text start="1076.88" dur="4.679">has just been</text><text start="1078.62" dur="4.98">um I think the level of like interest in</text><text start="1081.559" dur="4.201">both quadratic funding and public goods</text><text start="1083.6" dur="3.959">in the Phantom Community I think they&apos;ve</text><text start="1085.76" dur="3.72">been really well like interested in just</text><text start="1087.559" dur="2.941">sort of understanding like how do we</text><text start="1089.48" dur="2.46">think about</text><text start="1090.5" dur="3.78">um best practices how do we think about</text><text start="1091.94" dur="4.32">encouraging like good projects in our</text><text start="1094.28" dur="3.66">area so uh yeah just been really</text><text start="1096.26" dur="3.12">exciting to see that come up and I think</text><text start="1097.94" dur="3.96">they&apos;ve been looking at it as a big</text><text start="1099.38" dur="4.98">success they&apos;re they&apos;re excited to</text><text start="1101.9" dur="3.96">um get ready for their next round</text><text start="1104.36" dur="5.4">yeah one of the things that&apos;s exciting</text><text start="1105.86" dur="4.439">to me uh about this is this this idea of</text><text start="1109.76" dur="3.659">um</text><text start="1110.299" dur="6.301">you know open source code in general is</text><text start="1113.419" dur="5.64">is a networked good in that everyone who</text><text start="1116.6" dur="5.1">downloads my npm package or my pip</text><text start="1119.059" dur="4.5">package and submits a bug report back to</text><text start="1121.7" dur="3.9">the maintainer and that gets fixed makes</text><text start="1123.559" dur="4.141">it better for everyone else who is using</text><text start="1125.6" dur="3.84">that and I kind of see this this same</text><text start="1127.7" dur="3.18">sort of pattern forming with grants</text><text start="1129.44" dur="4.56">protocol this new code base that&apos;s</text><text start="1130.88" dur="5.58">totally modular because uh the what we</text><text start="1134.0" dur="4.62">what Bitcoin learns from the UNICEF and</text><text start="1136.46" dur="4.32">the Phantom rounds accrues value back to</text><text start="1138.62" dur="4.679">the mechanism design for the ethereum</text><text start="1140.78" dur="4.92">round and vice versa so in World in</text><text start="1143.299" dur="5.301">which there&apos;s n numbers of people using</text><text start="1145.7" dur="5.7">the allocation protocol allo protocol to</text><text start="1148.6" dur="4.06">uh fund their public goods then it just</text><text start="1151.4" dur="3.48">gets better for everyone else that&apos;s</text><text start="1152.66" dur="4.32">using it and everything sort of</text><text start="1154.88" dur="3.419">compounds from there I&apos;m wondering if</text><text start="1156.98" dur="3.6">you can kind of like draw me a trend</text><text start="1158.299" dur="4.861">line from UNICEF and Phantom to this</text><text start="1160.58" dur="4.74">ethereum Alpha round what comes what</text><text start="1163.16" dur="6.0">comes after the alpha round from there</text><text start="1165.32" dur="6.66">what&apos;s what&apos;s what&apos;s coming in 2023 from</text><text start="1169.16" dur="5.58">from Bitcoin so yeah I can hop in here</text><text start="1171.98" dur="4.199">um so more from a like the rounds of a</text><text start="1174.74" dur="2.4">running perspective not necessarily the</text><text start="1176.179" dur="3.36">product</text><text start="1177.14" dur="5.46">um our plan is currently to kick off</text><text start="1179.539" dur="5.581">kind of a larger protocol launch and get</text><text start="1182.6" dur="4.38">coin program launch in April</text><text start="1185.12" dur="4.14">um so basically you know we&apos;ve been</text><text start="1186.98" dur="6.24">doing these kind of quarterly uh round</text><text start="1189.26" dur="6.06">cadences for for four years now and we</text><text start="1193.22" dur="4.319">plan to sort of keep that up so the</text><text start="1195.32" dur="4.859">point of this Alpha round is to you know</text><text start="1197.539" dur="4.561">do a larger test of the protocol in its</text><text start="1200.179" dur="4.141">current state with you know hundreds of</text><text start="1202.1" dur="4.079">grantees uh and when we kind of open the</text><text start="1204.32" dur="4.14">floodgates to the full launch we&apos;re</text><text start="1206.179" dur="4.921">expecting you know probably closer to</text><text

sort of road map to get there</text><text start="1217.22" dur="3.6">um I think in February we&apos;ll be doing a</text><text start="1218.84" dur="4.079">lot of retrospectives on how this round</text><text start="1220.82" dur="5.34">went you know what kind of bugs we found</text><text start="1222.919" dur="4.741">uh ux issues uh what you know if it gets</text><text start="1226.16" dur="3.54">civil attacked or attacked in any way</text><text start="1227.66" dur="3.72">we&apos;ll take some learnings from that and</text><text start="1229.7" dur="4.14">then we&apos;ll kind of go turn around keep</text><text start="1231.38" dur="3.96">building through February March and in</text><text start="1233.84" dur="3.98">March what we want to do is run a few</text><text start="1235.34" dur="5.1">more sort of smaller scale test rounds</text><text start="1237.82" dur="4.479">but ideally with a lot of our kind of</text><text start="1240.44" dur="4.08">external Partners so we want to help</text><text start="1242.299" dur="4.74">enable other projects to run their own</text><text start="1244.52" dur="5.159">Grant programs but</text><text start="1247.039" dur="4.801">um you know more so to get used to the</text><text start="1249.679" dur="4.081">new protocol the tech how they can kind</text><text start="1251.84" dur="4.82">of set things up themselves and then</text><text start="1253.76" dur="5.7">lead this into something in April where</text><text start="1256.66" dur="5.8">we do more than just three rounds maybe</text><text start="1259.46" dur="5.099">five maybe ten that Bitcoin is kind of</text><text start="1262.46" dur="4.26">operating and hosting uh potentially</text><text start="1264.559" dur="4.801">featuring some other rounds from you</text><text start="1266.72" dur="5.52">know Partners projects in the ethereum</text><text start="1269.36" dur="6.179">OR broader you know evm compliant web 3</text><text start="1272.24" dur="5.939">space and and kind of go from there so</text><text start="1275.539" dur="4.801">you know with our own program currently</text><text start="1278.179" dur="3.961">the plan is to keep up this quarterly</text><text start="1280.34" dur="4.02">Cadence so do these kind of large</text><text start="1282.14" dur="5.159">Festival like like rounds every three</text><text start="1284.36" dur="5.22">months but what I think users can expect</text><text start="1287.299" dur="4.681">is that there will sort of be a lot of</text><text start="1289.58" dur="4.74">different things going on on different</text><text start="1291.98" dur="4.62">uh you know cadences at different times</text><text start="1294.32" dur="4.26">different lengths so rather than just</text><text start="1296.6" dur="4.199">having you know one two week period a</text><text start="1298.58" dur="4.979">quarter where there&apos;s a bunch of rounds</text><text start="1300.799" dur="4.74">happening at once you might find that</text><text start="1303.559" dur="3.841">you know this doubt or this chain</text><text start="1305.539" dur="4.441">decides they want to do something every</text><text start="1307.4" dur="4.56">you know two months or six months and</text><text start="1309.98" dur="4.02">they might run longer programs or</text><text start="1311.96" dur="4.02">shorter programs and so I think we&apos;ll</text><text start="1314.0" dur="3.72">start to be testing you know how that</text><text start="1315.98" dur="5.28">works when there&apos;s overlapping and</text><text start="1317.72" dur="6.839">varying uh programs going on but but</text><text start="1321.26" dur="5.82">yeah the get coin the Bitcoin program uh</text><text start="1324.559" dur="4.561">full protocol launch is planned for</text><text start="1327.08" dur="4.2">April and we&apos;re hoping to stick to that</text><text start="1329.12" dur="4.14">timeline and kind of continue from there</text><text start="1331.28" dur="4.2">on the three-month Cadence</text><text start="1333.26" dur="4.38">uh from a product perspective though</text><text start="1335.48" dur="4.319">Nate I mean I guess you could probably</text><text start="1337.64" dur="4.44">share more on what users could expect to</text><text start="1339.799" dur="3.481">be different in a few months time um</text><text start="1342.08" dur="3.12">compared to what they might see right</text><text start="1343.28" dur="3.54">now when they use the protocol</text><text start="1345.2" dur="2.64">yeah yeah</text><text start="1346.82" dur="3.9">um</text><text start="1347.84" dur="4.92">so I think one way to kind of think</text><text start="1350.72" dur="3.36">about this is right now we&apos;re we&apos;ve</text><text start="1352.76" dur="3.24">poured a bunch of concrete but it&apos;s</text><text start="1354.08" dur="3.719">still kind of wet I think a lot of what</text><text start="1356.0" dur="4.08">we&apos;ve been trying to figure out is what</text><text start="1357.799" dur="3.601">the what the ultimate foundation of the</text><text start="1360.08" dur="2.82">protocol should be I was mentioning</text><text start="1361.4" dur="2.88">before like what are those decision</text><text start="1362.9" dur="3.6">points like what are the things that you</text><text start="1364.28" dur="3.42">want to be able to customize and I think</text><text start="1366.5" dur="4.08">that&apos;s that&apos;s something we&apos;re still</text><text start="1367.7" dur="6.0">learning as we build this out but our</text><text start="1370.58" dur="5.7">hope is that from a protocol perspective</text><text start="1373.7" dur="5.339">um in April there&apos;s a pretty set uh</text><text start="1376.28" dur="4.08">protocol standard that we can start to</text><text start="1379.039" dur="3.361">um</text><text start="1380.36" dur="3.66">enable people to start building upon</text><text start="1382.4" dur="3.54">like having better developer</text><text start="1384.02" dur="5.039">documentation really start our developer</text><text start="1385.94" dur="5.82">Outreach to enable people to do that</text><text start="1389.059" dur="4.921">um on the kind of Grant stack protocol I</text><text start="1391.76" dur="4.5">think what people can expect is that uh</text><text start="1393.98" dur="3.84">or excuse me on the grant stack</text><text start="1396.26" dur="3.539">um point of view I think what people can</text><text start="1397.82" dur="5.219">expect is that</text><text start="1399.799" dur="4.801">uh in addition to the program that&apos;s</text><text start="1403.039" dur="3.0">running that there will have they&apos;ll</text><text start="1404.6" dur="3.059">have the ability to go and self-serve</text><text start="1406.039" dur="2.941">start creating their own rounds</text><text start="1407.659" dur="4.02">um one of the things that we&apos;re going to</text><text start="1408.98" dur="4.74">be doing once this round ends is kind of</text><text start="1411.679" dur="3.601">taking a breath as Conor said to shore</text><text start="1413.72" dur="3.24">up our documentation and just make sure</text><text start="1415.28" dur="4.32">it&apos;s really easy for people to come in</text><text start="1416.96" dur="5.16">and do what they want to do so that when</text><text start="1419.6" dur="4.02">everything goes live anyone who wants to</text><text start="1422.12" dur="3.12">come in and run a quadratic funding</text><text start="1423.62" dur="2.76">round will be able to do that using</text><text start="1425.24" dur="2.7">Grant stack</text><text start="1426.38" dur="4.2">um on their own set it up set their</text><text start="1427.94" dur="4.859">decisions and kind of go from there as</text><text start="1430.58" dur="4.68">we kind of widen the aperture and look a</text><text start="1432.799" dur="4.141">little bit further out into the year my</text><text start="1435.26" dur="3.659">hope is that you just start to see more</text><text start="1436.94" dur="4.739">functionality coming on top of that um</text><text start="1438.919" dur="5.701">so I think on the quadratic funding side</text><text start="1441.679" dur="6.421">we&apos;ve built I think like a very kind of</text><text start="1444.62" dur="4.799">clean V1 of qf that enables you to come</text><text start="1448.1" dur="4.079">in and do kind of like the basic version</text><text start="1449.419" dur="5.161">of qf but we want to start adding in the</text><text start="1452.179" dur="4.441">ability to do I think more interesting</text><text start="1454.58" dur="3.54">versions of that or or variations of</text><text start="1456.62" dur="3.72">that where you can start providing</text><text start="1458.12" dur="4.86">different types of weights to your</text><text start="1460.34" dur="4.199">community when you can kind of</text><text start="1462.98" dur="3.24">experiment with matching caps experiment</text><text start="1464.539" dur="2.64">with different types of civil defense so</text><text start="1466.22" dur="3.0">I think there&apos;s some like really</text><text start="1467.179" dur="3.841">interesting things coming on on the qf</text><text start="1469.22" dur="2.88">side specifically I think some of the</text><text start="1471.02" dur="4.08">other things that we&apos;re really excited</text><text start="1472.1" dur="5.819">to build on top of the protocol are this</text><text start="1475.1" dur="4.38">idea of project reputation</text><text start="1477.919" dur="2.941">um so I think one thing that we hear</text><text start="1479.48" dur="3.36">from communities when they&apos;re trying to</text><text start="1480.86" dur="4.439">run grants programs is how do I know</text><text start="1482.84" dur="4.26">which projects to trust and we&apos;re trying</text><text start="1485.299" dur="4.201">to create the ability for projects to</text><text start="1487.1" dur="3.72">really earn those almost as stamps like</text><text start="1489.5" dur="3.059">for people to be able to learn like yes</text><text start="1490.82" dur="5.76">I&apos;ve been a part of different git coin</text><text start="1492.559" dur="5.281">rounds or yes I&apos;ve shipped XYZ features</text><text start="1496.58" dur="2.94">um just helping people really understand</text><text start="1497.84" dur="4.44">like who these projects are so that they</text><text start="1499.52" dur="4.86">can start to more easily engage in</text><text start="1502.28" dur="3.96">funding programs and I think the other</text><text start="1504.38" dur="4.26">thing that we&apos;ll be adding on top of</text><text start="1506.24" dur="5.88">this is just more</text><text start="1508.64" dur="5.34">um additional types of Grants programs</text><text start="1512.12" dur="3.9">and funding programs so being able to do</text><text start="1513.98" dur="3.54">things like direct rounds quadratic fund</text><text start="1516.02" dur="4.68">voting is something that we&apos;re really</text><text start="1517.52" dur="6.0">excited about building so the tldr is</text><text start="1520.7" dur="4.26">that come April the product will enable</text><text start="1523.52" dur="3.539">you to come in and run a self-serve</text><text start="1524.96" dur="4.319">quadratic funding round with all the</text><text start="1527.059" dur="3.541">documentation you need and as we push</text><text start="1529.279" dur="3.121">out towards the year you&apos;ll see</text><text start="1530.6" dur="4.199">additional functionality on quadratic</text><text start="1532.4" dur="5.7">funding on top of quadratic voting</text><text start="1534.799" dur="6.301">direct grants programs as well as some</text><text start="1538.1" dur="4.439">project reputation so TBD on what exact</text><text start="1541.1" dur="2.88">order that comes in but that&apos;s what</text><text start="1542.539" dur="3.12">we&apos;re eyeing through the rest of the</text><text start="1543.98" dur="4.079">year</text><text start="1545.659" dur="5.041">and I think something that I&apos;ll I&apos;ll add</text><text start="1548.059" dur="5.281">in there it&apos;s like one thing we did fall</text><text start="1550.7" dur="5.52">you know these elf arounds with Bitcoin</text><text start="1553.34" dur="5.64">was just do a few small simulated rounds</text><text start="1556.22" dur="5.339">ourselves just to like learn about how</text><text start="1558.98" dur="5.28">the whole thing worked so we came in</text><text start="1561.559" dur="4.141">with like 10 grantees put up just like a</text><text start="1564.26" dur="4.019">small amount like it was like two</text><text start="1565.7" dur="5.219">thousand dollars that we that we put up</text><text start="1568.279" dur="5.461">um got a few donors to come and</text><text start="1570.919" dur="5.521">contribute and just by kind of creating</text><text start="1573.74" dur="4.319">a like container it was a safe container</text><text start="1576.44" dur="3.42">that we got to learn in that we got to</text><text start="1578.059" dur="3.961">test it in that&apos;s what we would love to</text><text start="1579.86" dur="4.08">see Partners do too to start like if</text><text start="1582.02" dur="4.259">they&apos;re concerned about going in and</text><text start="1583.94" dur="3.96">like running a whole big self-service</text><text start="1586.279" dur="3.121">round and they&apos;re like I don&apos;t know this</text><text start="1587.9" dur="3.18">is a lot of funding I don&apos;t know what</text><text start="1589.4" dur="4.2">how reviews are gonna look I don&apos;t know</text><text start="1591.08" dur="4.079">how donations are going to look like the</text><text start="1593.6" dur="3.84">beauty of the protocol will be that</text><text start="1595.159" dur="4.921">people can go on do something small just</text><text start="1597.44" dur="4.68">to test it out and then run as many or</text><text start="1600.08" dur="4.32">as few larger rounds as they want and</text><text start="1602.12" dur="4.86">moving forward and I think</text><text start="1604.4" dur="4.5">what&apos;s what what we&apos;re trying to build</text><text start="1606.98" dur="4.86">is like a world where you know anyone</text><text start="1608.9" dur="4.98">can come around around at any time but</text><text start="1611.84" dur="5.76">we&apos;ll be you know running this get going</text><text start="1613.88" dur="5.58">program on a regular Cadence so you know</text><text start="1617.6" dur="4.199">starting at quarterly and that&apos;s really</text><text start="1619.46" dur="4.62">focused on like funding public goods at</text><text start="1621.799" dur="4.201">our get coin Community cares about</text><text start="1624.08" dur="3.66">and we&apos;re saying you know anyone that</text><text start="1626.0" dur="3.179">wants to come and run around at the same</text><text start="1627.74" dur="3.6">time as us to get like more</text><text start="1629.179" dur="4.86">discoverability to get you know more</text><text start="1631.34" dur="4.8">insight into just like how we run rounds</text><text start="1634.039" dur="4.201">um learning from just like our marketing</text><text start="1636.14" dur="5.279">being a part of that like running around</text><text start="1638.24" dur="5.28">at the same time uh where you do want to</text><text start="1641.419" dur="3.481">fund public goods as a partner</text><text start="1643.52" dur="3.659">um and you&apos;re just trying to learn at</text><text start="1644.9" dur="4.44">the same time like we&apos;re we&apos;re stoked to</text><text start="1647.179" dur="4.021">have Partners running around at the same</text><text start="1649.34" dur="4.92">time so that&apos;s something I think I&apos;m</text><text start="1651.2" dur="5.459">pretty pretty excited about</text><text start="1654.26" dur="4.86">yeah it feels like y&apos;all have entered</text><text start="1656.659" dur="4.681">this sort of like ooda Loop of</text><text start="1659.12" dur="4.919">Udo is this idea when you&apos;re in an</text><text start="1661.34" dur="4.26">unknown territory in which you can uh</text><text start="1664.039" dur="4.02">observe what&apos;s happening around you</text><text start="1665.6" dur="3.36">Orient decide what to do and then you</text><text start="1668.059" dur="3.301">act</text><text start="1668.96" dur="4.199">um and it&apos;s this iterative Loop that I</text><text start="1671.36" dur="3.66">remember being in in Bitcoin grants</text><text start="1673.159" dur="4.62">rounds one through I think I was</text><text start="1675.02" dur="6.18">involved through like rounds 12 uh in</text><text start="1677.779" dur="5.64">which we would kind of uh just plan out</text><text start="1681.2" dur="5.16">around talk to vitalik see what he wants</text><text start="1683.419" dur="4.681">in the mechanism uh roll out the rounds</text><text start="1686.36" dur="3.78">and</text><text start="1688.1" dur="3.54">um get the data back and then decide</text><text start="1690.14" dur="3.6">what to do what we learned from the</text><text start="1691.64" dur="4.019">round and it was it was that cycle of</text><text start="1693.74" dur="3.78">sort of being in this dance with the</text><text start="1695.659" dur="5.041">community through which we tried things</text><text start="1697.52" dur="4.86">like negative voting and Collections and</text><text start="1700.7" dur="3.18">checking I think Bitcoin was one of the</text><text start="1702.38" dur="4.5">first d-ops to integrate with the layer</text><text start="1703.88" dur="6.06">two because uh you know there was just</text><text start="1706.88" dur="5.76">so much usage on on bitcoin and with the</text><text start="1709.94" dur="4.739">median transaction costs or median</text><text start="1712.64" dur="4.32">transaction being like a dollar having</text><text start="1714.679" dur="4.081">having really low cost transactions was</text><text start="1716.96" dur="3.18">really important so just entering into</text><text start="1718.76" dur="4.44">that dance with the community is what</text><text start="1720.14" dur="4.86">I&apos;m really excited to see Bitcoin do uh</text><text start="1723.2" dur="3.54">with the with the new modular protocol</text><text start="1725.0" dur="3.779">and it&apos;s a whole new team a whole new</text><text start="1726.74" dur="4.439">governance system a whole new code base</text><text start="1728.779" dur="5.161">and and so y&apos;all are going to be</text><text start="1731.179" dur="4.74">climbing towards towards better</text><text start="1733.94" dur="3.359">allocation Resources with the community</text><text start="1735.919" dur="3.541">it seems like I mean I guess like what&apos;s</text><text start="1737.299" dur="4.141">the global Maxima that that you&apos;re</text><text start="1739.46" dur="5.42">iterating towards as you as you kick off</text><text start="1741.44" dur="3.44">these rounds in 2023</text><text start="1745.82" dur="6.599">I think personally the the thing that I</text><text start="1748.4" dur="6.48">am most excited about is this really</text><text start="1752.419" dur="3.601">fluid sort of resource allocation for</text><text start="1754.88" dur="3.0">communities I realize that&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1756.02" dur="3.24">buzzwords but I think you know the</text><text start="1757.88" dur="3.659">communities that I get really excited</text><text start="1759.26" dur="5.76">about are the ones that tend to be sort</text><text start="1761.539" dur="4.921">of like local you know like neighborhood</text><text start="1765.02" dur="2.94">communities like it&apos;s a neighborhood</text><text start="1766.46" dur="3.06">sort of coming together to decide how do</text><text start="1767.96" dur="3.42">we want to like pool some resources</text><text start="1769.52" dur="4.2">towards improving what&apos;s what&apos;s here</text><text start="1771.38" dur="3.72">what we&apos;re working towards or more sort</text><text start="1773.72" dur="3.3">of like Regional oriented things this</text><text start="1775.1" dur="3.9">idea of sort of like localism or like</text><text start="1777.02" dur="4.68">digital localism I think is is super</text><text start="1779.0" dur="4.32">exciting and what I see for</text><text start="1781.7" dur="3.66">um and I think</text><text start="1783.32" dur="3.06">what excites me about the protocol is</text><text start="1785.36" dur="4.199">that</text><text start="1786.38" dur="5.46">if we do all this right there&apos;s an</text><text start="1789.559" dur="4.98">opportunity for communities to really</text><text start="1791.84" dur="4.199">easily say like

that&apos;s</text><text start="1798.02" dur="4.62">a vote system you know and get to a</text><text start="1799.94" dur="4.68">point where like we can decide</text><text start="1802.64" dur="4.08">um in groups like really quickly how we</text><text start="1804.62" dur="5.22">want to put our money against something</text><text start="1806.72" dur="5.1">um but I think what that also does is is</text><text start="1809.84" dur="4.079">kind of give us a spot that we can start</text><text start="1811.82" dur="3.599">to plug in like ongoing funds like I</text><text start="1813.919" dur="2.601">think this is what it&apos;s been such an</text><text start="1815.419" dur="3.961">interesting</text><text start="1816.52" dur="4.96">application for web 3 protocols where if</text><text

start="1837.559" dur="4.201">um day-to-day lives too like is there</text><text start="1839.96" dur="3.48">some sort of always on funding that we</text><text start="1841.76" dur="2.7">can be directing to to Regional</text><text start="1843.44" dur="2.94">communities local communities things</text><text start="1844.46" dur="4.319">like that let me ask you the state is</text><text start="1846.38" dur="4.38">there one perfect coordination mechanism</text><text start="1848.779" dur="4.441">that is going to be the right fit for</text><text start="1850.76" dur="5.22">all communities to allocate

I think that</text><text start="1860.059" dur="5.821">I think that there is going to be a</text><text start="1863.659" dur="3.781">a plethora of sort of tools and it&apos;s</text><text start="1865.88" dur="2.94">going to be like one of our jobs I think</text><text start="1867.44" dur="3.0">is a dow is going to be understanding</text><text start="1868.82" dur="3.0">like which tools are right for which</text><text start="1870.44" dur="3.18">situations and how can we help</text><text start="1871.82" dur="2.88">communities figure out what makes the</text><text start="1873.62" dur="3.24">most sense</text><text start="1874.7" dur="4.26">like I think quadratic funding is super</text><text start="1876.86" dur="3.66">interesting when you have a large</text><text start="1878.96" dur="3.24">engaged Community that&apos;s willing to</text><text start="1880.52" dur="3.659">donate on top of that and sort of like</text><text start="1882.2" dur="2.64">supercharge what you&apos;re doing</text><text start="1884.179" dur="2.761">um</text><text start="1884.84" dur="4.26">I think things like quadratic voting are</text><text start="1886.94" dur="4.26">super interesting when it&apos;s maybe a</text><text start="1889.1" dur="3.179">smaller Community or or you have like a</text><text start="1891.2" dur="2.459">more</text><text start="1892.279" dur="3.78">um kind of credentialed community or</text><text start="1893.659" dur="4.441">something like that so I think there&apos;s a</text><text start="1896.059" dur="3.6">lot of room for design and learning but</text><text start="1898.1" dur="4.079">no I don&apos;t think there&apos;s one one</text><text start="1899.659" dur="4.861">specific thing so the aloe protocol the</text><text start="1902.179" dur="4.201">allocation protocol really it seems like</text><text start="1904.52" dur="3.42">that&apos;s going to get forked a lot and</text><text start="1906.38" dur="5.279">there&apos;s going to be

start="1913.94" dur="2.459">funding</text><text start="1915.2" dur="2.459">um and then if you all want to get</text><text start="1916.399" dur="3.481">really weird there could be allo</text><text start="1917.659" dur="6.12">protocols for Assurance contracts or</text><text start="1919.88" dur="6.779">hyper certs or uh sortition</text><text start="1923.779" dur="5.88">um demurrage ranked Choice voting like</text><text start="1926.659" dur="5.76">you know Griffith Griff uh the founder</text><text start="1929.659" dur="5.52">of giveth and I just did a a podcast on</text><text start="1932.419" dur="4.5">coordination mechanisms and it uh we</text><text start="1935.179" dur="4.5">found like 25 different coordination</text><text start="1936.919" dur="5.161">mechanisms and so I&apos;m I&apos;m curious to see</text><text start="1939.679" dur="3.661">how wide and deep the allocation</text><text start="1942.08" dur="3.0">protocols</text><text start="1943.34" dur="3.54">get is it the allocation protocol</text><text start="1945.08" dur="4.26">that&apos;ll be forked and and how does that</text><text start="1946.88" dur="3.84">sort of like vision of of trying out all</text><text start="1949.34" dur="4.68">those different mechanisms resonate with</text><text start="1950.72" dur="4.92">you as as the product lead yeah it</text><text start="1954.02" dur="3.36">sounds like exactly what we want to have</text><text start="1955.64" dur="4.34">I think when I think about the protocol</text><text start="1957.38" dur="5.46">like the things that are going to be</text><text start="1959.98" dur="4.54">really powerful elements of it</text><text start="1962.84" dur="4.68">um I think one is like the concept of</text><text start="1964.52" dur="4.62">like a project in its reputation like if</text><text start="1967.52" dur="3.24">you&apos;re if you&apos;re trying to allocate</text><text start="1969.14" dur="3.539">funds you&apos;re trying to allocate funds to</text><text start="1970.76" dur="3.659">somewhere so knowing that like the place</text><text start="1972.679" dur="3.181">that you were allocating to or the</text><text start="1974.419" dur="3.901">people that you were allocating to or</text><text start="1975.86" dur="3.6">are trustworthy or like capable of doing</text><text start="1978.32" dur="2.64">the thing that you want to do I think is</text><text start="1979.46" dur="3.24">super important so that to me is like</text><text start="1980.96" dur="3.18">something that&apos;s</text><text start="1982.7" dur="3.3">that we need to make sure is like</text><text start="1984.14" dur="3.899">shining through</text><text start="1986.0" dur="3.899">um but I think the other part of this</text><text start="1988.039" dur="3.901">equation is just what are the different</text><text start="1989.899" dur="3.9">ways that your community your verified</text><text start="1991.94" dur="3.719">Community can make a decision</text><text start="1993.799" dur="3.72">um so I think the more that we have</text><text start="1995.659" dur="4.14">those decision-making mechanisms whether</text><text start="1997.519" dur="4.741">it&apos;s quadratic funding or one of the</text><text start="1999.799" dur="4.86">other 25 from your list</text><text start="2002.26" dur="4.139">um I I think that&apos;s exactly what we want</text><text start="2004.659" dur="3.601">to see happen</text><text start="2006.399" dur="3.841">right so if I just want to put pinch and</text><text start="2008.26" dur="4.68">zoom on this so git coin is no longer a</text><text start="2010.24" dur="4.919">quadratic funding maximalists because</text><text start="2012.94" dur="4.859">there&apos;s other allocation protocols that</text><text start="2015.159" dur="3.721">could be built into grant stack did I</text><text start="2017.799" dur="4.321">hear that correctly or is there a shade</text><text start="2018.88" dur="6.36">of gray there I I would not claim to</text><text start="2022.12" dur="6.48">speak for Bitcoin uh I am one note in</text><text start="2025.24" dur="5.279">the network so what I know likes to say</text><text start="2028.6" dur="4.74">um I</text><text start="2030.519" dur="4.5">I I think like I love quadratic funding</text><text start="2033.34" dur="3.66">as a mechanism I think it&apos;s a super</text><text start="2035.019" dur="3.181">important mechanism I I&apos;m curious what</text><text start="2037.0" dur="2.94">Janine and Connor think I think it&apos;s</text><text start="2038.2" dur="4.14">going to be a key part of like our</text><text start="2039.94" dur="4.44">program going forward I think from a</text><text start="2042.34" dur="3.12">protocol perspective I think there&apos;s</text><text start="2044.38" dur="3.12">going to be a ton of different</text><text start="2045.46" dur="4.139">opportunities it just seems like for</text><text start="2047.5" dur="3.3">what bitcoin&apos;s doing right now quadratic</text><text start="2049.599" dur="3.78">funding is like</text><text start="2050.8" dur="4.44">the best way for us to express our</text><text start="2053.379" dur="4.921">opinions as a community</text><text start="2055.24" dur="5.28">okay I kind of think adding on that like</text><text start="2058.3" dur="3.78">agreed quadratic funding right now is</text><text start="2060.52" dur="3.18">working really well for the program so</text><text start="2062.08" dur="4.38">like getting that right on the protocol</text><text start="2063.7" dur="5.159">is step one like let&apos;s get that let&apos;s</text><text start="2066.46" dur="4.02">get that sort of locked down but then</text><text start="2068.859" dur="3.181">kind of to the point of like why we&apos;re</text><text start="2070.48" dur="3.84">building a modular protocol it&apos;s like</text><text start="2072.04" dur="4.619">the hope is that it builds and fix and</text><text start="2074.32" dur="4.559">changes in different people come in and</text><text start="2076.659" dur="4.141">build on top of it and bring like</text><text start="2078.879" dur="2.941">totally new allocation design to the</text><text start="2080.8" dur="2.94">table</text><text start="2081.82" dur="3.299">um I think qf is like a step in the</text><text start="2083.74" dur="4.919">right direction like if you think about</text><text start="2085.119" dur="6.181">the Fiat world and communities like how</text><text start="2088.659" dur="4.68">communities work where it&apos;s like any</text><text start="2091.3" dur="3.839">Financial allocation is there it&apos;s a</text><text start="2093.339" dur="3.361">membership model right it&apos;s like you&apos;re</text><text start="2095.139" dur="4.501">paying a friend you&apos;re paying a specific</text><text start="2096.7" dur="5.58">amount every month think about like a</text><text start="2099.64" dur="3.9">Country Club think about Soho House</text><text start="2102.28" dur="1.86">think about</text><text start="2103.54" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="2104.14" dur="4.86">any any random Community it&apos;s like</text><text start="2107.26" dur="3.72">you&apos;re paying a membership and like you</text><text start="2109.0" dur="3.54">don&apos;t really get to choose what&apos;s in</text><text start="2110.98" dur="3.24">there you&apos;re just like okay well I guess</text><text start="2112.54" dur="3.299">I&apos;ll be a part of this and like I don&apos;t</text><text start="2114.22" dur="3.72">know where my money&apos;s going</text><text start="2115.839" dur="4.081">um but like imagine you can kind of</text><text start="2117.94" dur="3.659">fracture that out like qf is a great way</text><text start="2119.92" dur="4.199">to stop but like that&apos;s just the</text><text start="2121.599" dur="4.801">beginning of a really long road to get</text><text start="2124.119" dur="5.341">much more dynamic in terms of how we&apos;re</text><text start="2126.4" dur="5.959">allocating and meeting and reaching</text><text start="2129.46" dur="2.899">communities needs</text><text start="2132.82" dur="5.22">yeah I I plus one of that I mean I</text><text start="2136.06" dur="4.019">personally think that like quadratic</text><text start="2138.04" dur="3.9">funding is sort of where Bitcoin has</text><text start="2140.079" dur="3.121">found its Niche or like originally found</text><text start="2141.94" dur="2.82">its Niche</text><text start="2143.2" dur="3.24">um and that&apos;s you know it&apos;s really what</text><text start="2144.76" dur="3.42">we&apos;re known for and what a lot of the</text><text start="2146.44" dur="4.08">web Community</text><text start="2148.18" dur="4.26">um you know kind of sees get coin ads</text><text start="2150.52" dur="3.3">and what they use our platform for that</text><text start="2152.44" dur="3.179">said that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;ll be like</text><text start="2153.82" dur="4.38">that you know forever there&apos;s other qf</text><text start="2155.619" dur="4.201">platforms coming up uh and already out</text><text start="2158.2" dur="4.139">there&apos;s there&apos;s other mechanisms that</text><text start="2159.82" dur="5.519">keep going plans to experiment with but</text><text start="2162.339" dur="5.701">personally I&apos;m I&apos;m very bullish on qf</text><text start="2165.339" dur="4.921">and it doesn&apos;t have to be qf in its</text><text start="2168.04" dur="4.26">current form or necessarily like just</text><text start="2170.26" dur="4.68">kind of plain vanilla quadratic funding</text><text start="2172.3" dur="5.16">I think even on the old grants platform</text><text start="2174.94" dur="5.399">that we ran that was fairly centralized</text><text start="2177.46" dur="4.74">uh it changed a lot over the years you</text><text start="2180.339" dur="3.841">know we it initially was just kind of</text><text start="2182.2" dur="3.24">like one big matching pool or one small</text><text start="2184.18" dur="3.659">matching pool</text><text start="2185.44" dur="4.2">um that all grants were sharing we</text><text start="2187.839" dur="3.601">started playing around with categories</text><text start="2189.64" dur="4.14">where grants had to be in one category</text><text start="2191.44" dur="4.2">they couldn&apos;t be multiple and they had a</text><text start="2193.78" dur="4.5">certain amount of you know matching</text><text start="2195.64" dur="4.92">allocated to each category uh we started</text><text start="2198.28" dur="5.1">doing we actually merged it back into</text><text start="2200.56" dur="5.46">get together to one large round again uh</text><text start="2203.38" dur="4.56">we added things like like pairwise qf</text><text start="2206.02" dur="4.62">where it actually looks at the donations</text><text start="2207.94" dur="5.639">and the patterns among donors and we&apos;ll</text><text start="2210.64" dur="5.16">we&apos;ll dampen uh groups of donors that</text><text start="2213.579" dur="4.681">look like they&apos;re colluding uh we added</text><text start="2215.8" dur="4.44">things like matching caps so there&apos;s a</text><text start="2218.26" dur="4.079">maximum amount that one Grant could take</text><text start="2220.24" dur="4.74">that then redistributes it to other</text><text start="2222.339" dur="3.78">grants so you know we we kind of</text><text start="2224.98" dur="3.66">experimented and played around with them</text><text start="2226.119" dur="4.98">mechanism a lot to see how that changed</text><text start="2228.64" dur="4.08">the results and</text><text start="2231.099" dur="3.121">we&apos;re going to continue doing that but</text><text start="2232.72" dur="3.899">now we&apos;re at a point where we can enable</text><text start="2234.22" dur="4.26">anyone to kind of do that and you know</text><text start="2236.619" dur="3.72">experiment in their own way and and take</text><text start="2238.48" dur="4.8">what you know they learn from each each</text><text start="2240.339" dur="5.221">iterative round and to build on that or</text><text start="2243.28" dur="4.44">to change that and so to kind of go back</text><text start="2245.56" dur="3.6">to the initial question of like</text><text start="2247.72" dur="3.48">you know what what are we excited about</text><text start="2249.16" dur="3.9">or what&apos;s like what&apos;s the addressable</text><text start="2251.2" dur="6.54">Market here you know in the short term</text><text start="2253.06" dur="6.539">I&apos;m super bullish on qf and coordination</text><text start="2257.74" dur="5.099">mechanisms that kind of can happen in</text><text start="2259.599" dur="5.821">the gitcoin protocol as being a part of</text><text start="2262.839" dur="4.561">the Dow tooling stack so</text><text start="2265.42" dur="3.659">um you know maybe a dow has you know</text><text start="2267.4" dur="3.36">they have a governance token they like</text><text start="2269.079" dur="3.841">vote to make decisions they also have a</text><text start="2270.76" dur="4.38">regular grants program this will just be</text><text start="2272.92" dur="4.08">like a piece of that puzzle that you</text><text start="2275.14" dur="4.14">know lets them say okay we&apos;re going to</text><text start="2277.0" dur="5.22">allocate you know X percent of our</text><text start="2279.28" dur="4.62">funding to this matching pool and use</text><text start="2282.22" dur="4.44">that to incentivize Community donations</text><text start="2283.9" dur="5.0">Community votes and and more you know</text><text start="2286.66" dur="5.16">active contributing and decision making</text><text start="2288.9" dur="5.62">and so I think it kind of fits in you</text><text start="2291.82" dur="5.46">know in a lot of dows or layer twos or</text><text start="2294.52" dur="4.26">you know kind of like a decentralized</text><text start="2297.28" dur="2.94">protocols where it&apos;s a decision making</text><text start="2298.78" dur="3.18">tool</text><text start="2300.22" dur="3.96">um in the shorter term and and I think</text><text start="2301.96" dur="5.399">that&apos;s primarily because you know web3</text><text start="2304.18" dur="5.22">also has these uh kind of ux you know</text><text start="2307.359" dur="4.021">bear barriers to get over and water</text><text start="2309.4" dur="5.28">adoption you know we need to make all</text><text start="2311.38" dur="4.739">this simpler to use but in the next you</text><text start="2314.68" dur="2.88">know one to two to three years I think</text><text start="2316.119" dur="4.021">this could really kind of fit in as a</text><text start="2317.56" dur="4.92">piece of the Dow tooling uh stack but</text><text start="2320.14" dur="3.959">then longer term like I would love to</text><text

dur="4.08">allows it teaches you to fish totally</text><text start="2359.2" dur="2.76">speak</text><text start="2360.52" dur="3.66">um the other analogy that I see out in</text><text start="2361.96" dur="3.78">Market is the uh I actually read this on</text><text start="2364.18" dur="4.2">the coin forum someone posted about it</text><text start="2365.74" dur="5.879">but uh like the op stack is a way of</text><text start="2368.38" dur="5.16">composing an L2 with modular components</text><text start="2371.619" dur="4.98">so that anyone can take the optimism</text><text start="2373.54" dur="5.4">code base and build an L2</text><text start="2376.599" dur="4.5">um whereas like optimism their old</text><text start="2378.94" dur="3.24">version was just like they ran an L2 for</text><text start="2381.099" dur="3.361">you</text><text start="2382.18" dur="4.86">um and and the the Sim the parallel I</text><text start="2384.46" dur="4.56">see with Grant stack is that Grant stack</text><text start="2387.04" dur="4.559">is a modular set of code bases that</text><text start="2389.02" dur="4.38">allows you to run a plain vanilla grants</text><text start="2391.599" dur="3.24">program or quadratic funding grants</text><text start="2393.4" dur="3.179">program you can compose any sort of</text><text start="2394.839" dur="4.02">Grants program using the grant stack</text><text start="2396.579" dur="5.04">similar to how with the op stack you can</text><text start="2398.859" dur="5.401">compose a uh L2</text><text start="2401.619" dur="5.421">um yeah is it any reaction to that or is</text><text start="2404.26" dur="2.78">that directionally correct</text><text start="2407.32" dur="3.92">yeah that feels right</text><text start="2409.18" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="2411.82" dur="3.84">I think there have been a number of like</text><text start="2413.14" dur="3.959">and like I think you might have talked</text><text start="2415.66" dur="2.82">about this analogy early on too but like</text><text start="2417.099" dur="3.661">I&apos;ve always really enjoyed the idea of</text><text start="2418.48" dur="4.02">like the wordpress.com and wordpress.org</text><text start="2420.76" dur="2.579">kind of analogy too where it&apos;s like</text><text start="2422.5" dur="3.66">we&apos;re</text><text start="2423.339" dur="4.02">like there&apos;s just a basic system for</text><text start="2426.16" dur="3.48">running</text><text start="2427.359" dur="4.201">um you know running blogs in that case</text><text start="2429.64" dur="3.54">that&apos;s the allo protocol uh and then</text><text start="2431.56" dur="2.58">having like Grand stack on top of it for</text><text start="2433.18" dur="2.82">people who want a little bit more</text><text start="2434.14" dur="3.479">hand-holding but</text><text start="2436.0" dur="3.96">um but yeah I think that&apos;s absolutely</text><text start="2437.619" dur="3.901">right like we want we want people to be</text><text start="2439.96" dur="3.659">able to like get into the code base of</text><text start="2441.52" dur="3.059">the protocol experiment with it build on</text><text start="2443.619" dur="2.22">top of it</text><text start="2444.579" dur="4.141">um and in the meantime we&apos;re also going</text><text start="2445.839" dur="5.161">to be providing a really simple UI for</text><text start="2448.72" dur="3.84">people who want to just be able to</text><text start="2451.0" dur="4.68">um run this without having to get into</text><text start="2452.56" dur="4.2">it so there&apos;s the express lane where you</text><text start="2455.68" dur="3.84">hit a button you get in touch with</text><text start="2456.76" dur="5.22">bitcoin&apos;s Partnerships team and they&apos;ll</text><text start="2459.52" dur="4.319">help you run around in the fast lane or</text><text start="2461.98" dur="4.32">you can Fork it and go run it yourself</text><text start="2463.839" dur="3.601">and that&apos;s the analogy with WordPress uh</text><text start="2466.3" dur="2.64">where you can go to Wordpress and you</text><text start="2467.44" dur="4.38">can just spin up a Blog and pay five</text><text start="2468.94" dur="6.24">dollars a month or uh you can Fork the</text><text start="2471.82" dur="5.4">code base and run it uh you sort of see</text><text start="2475.18" dur="4.98">that Spectrum from Full Service to to</text><text start="2477.22" dur="5.16">doing it yourself exactly exactly</text><text start="2480.16" dur="4.32">and I and I think a big a big piece of</text><text start="2482.38" dur="6.42">that that&apos;s like a huge unlock in it</text><text start="2484.48" dur="6.18">from uh what we did is like the platform</text><text start="2488.8" dur="4.14">previously to now we have the protocol</text><text start="2490.66" dur="3.9">was like before was like how many rounds</text><text start="2492.94" dur="4.74">could we run and it was all based on</text><text start="2494.56" dur="5.46">like the operational team and how yeah</text><text start="2497.68" dur="3.899">what capacity we had</text><text start="2500.02" dur="4.26">um as well as like people having to run</text><text start="2501.579" dur="4.02">on our coldly Cadence and now sort of</text><text start="2504.28" dur="3.299">shifting into the space where it&apos;s like</text><text start="2505.599" dur="4.02">run a grants program in your own</text><text start="2507.579" dur="3.721">capacity in your own way it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2509.619" dur="4.141">necessarily have to be</text><text start="2511.3" dur="4.68">the same way that we&apos;ve been trying to</text><text start="2513.76" dur="3.359">get people to run rounds um like you</text><text start="2515.98" dur="2.34">could just do it just to hire people</text><text start="2517.119" dur="3.421">right like if you want to have a</text><text start="2518.32" dur="3.779">subtraction mindset of hiring and not</text><text start="2520.54" dur="2.819">bring people internally but you just</text><text start="2522.099" dur="4.081">want to find projects that are building</text><text start="2523.359" dur="5.101">in your ecosystem like run a continuous</text><text start="2526.18" dur="4.2">grants around for for the uh and see</text><text start="2528.46" dur="4.86">where that goes so it&apos;s just like this</text><text start="2530.38" dur="5.58">like huge unlock from a operational</text><text start="2533.32" dur="4.62">capacity standpoint where it&apos;s not</text><text start="2535.96" dur="5.119">reliant on our team anymore in terms of</text><text start="2537.94" dur="5.76">how many rounds run and when</text><text start="2541.079" dur="4.121">uh yeah and I guess I would just adding</text><text start="2543.7" dur="3.6">and I think Kevin you actually maybe can</text><text start="2545.2" dur="4.139">speak to this a lot as well but like you</text><text start="2547.3" dur="3.72">know we didn&apos;t build again this is</text><text start="2549.339" dur="3.601">because you built a lot of the the</text><text start="2551.02" dur="4.62">initial you know sea grants platform</text><text start="2552.94" dur="4.56">through you know 2019 over over the</text><text start="2555.64" dur="3.479">years secret stands for centralized</text><text start="2557.5" dur="4.02">grants yeah yeah so that&apos;s the old</text><text start="2559.119" dur="4.801">grants platform that you know many of</text><text start="2561.52" dur="4.68">you if you&apos;ve donated to do uh a Bitcoin</text><text start="2563.92" dur="6.12">grants round before that&apos;s the platform</text><text start="2566.2" dur="5.34">you were using uh and yeah so you know</text><text start="2570.04" dur="3.66">Kevin you were obviously an instrumental</text><text start="2571.54" dur="4.5">piece in launching that and maintaining</text><text start="2573.7" dur="4.379">it for a long time but like the reason</text><text start="2576.04" dur="4.44">why it was built in the way it was</text><text start="2578.079" dur="4.201">wasn&apos;t that because we wanted it to be</text><text start="2580.48" dur="3.359">centralized we wanted to control it you</text><text start="2582.28" dur="4.44">know we wanted to like gate who could</text><text start="2583.839" dur="5.76">use the the platform but more so out of</text><text start="2586.72" dur="6.42">necessity uh because I think you know if</text><text start="2589.599" dur="6.421">if you haven&apos;t solved for uh you know</text><text start="2593.14" dur="5.1">preventing civil attacks or fraud or uh</text><text start="2596.02" dur="4.2">you know identity systems then like the</text><text start="2598.24" dur="4.92">whole the whole mechanism of quadratic</text><text start="2600.22" dur="4.74">funding just told really breaks and you</text><text start="2603.16" dur="4.38">know I still think maybe we&apos;re not there</text><text start="2604.96" dur="4.44">yet we&apos;re like we have a robust you know</text><text start="2607.54" dur="3.6">trust trusted like decentralized</text><text start="2609.4" dur="4.62">identity system</text><text start="2611.14" dur="4.679">um but you know we we sort of had to</text><text start="2614.02" dur="3.96">like admin these rounds</text><text start="2615.819" dur="4.081">um as as get coin and kind of make sure</text><text start="2617.98" dur="4.5">you know grants are being approved in a</text><text start="2619.9" dur="4.38">fair way uh donate donors weren&apos;t gaming</text><text start="2622.48" dur="4.98">the system we weren&apos;t getting you know</text><text start="2624.28" dur="5.039">civil adapt and like a widespread way uh</text><text start="2627.46" dur="3.84">and if we kind of launched it as a</text><text start="2629.319" dur="3.661">decentralized platform I think we were</text><text start="2631.3" dur="3.42">missing a lot of those identity tools</text><text start="2632.98" dur="4.92">that that really allow you to like</text><text start="2634.72" dur="5.34">prevent those those attacks so you know</text><text start="2637.9" dur="3.719">for a long time like we were kind of in</text><text start="2640.06" dur="2.94">control of these rounds because we had</text><text start="2641.619" dur="3.061">to have all these things on the back end</text><text start="2643.0" dur="5.64">where you know we&apos;re sort of ensuring</text><text start="2644.68" dur="5.52">the fairness and preventing uh malicious</text><text start="2648.64" dur="4.08">actors from from cheating in the system</text><text start="2650.2" dur="4.5">but I think the whole web three space</text><text start="2652.72" dur="5.42">has evolved a lot in the last four years</text><text start="2654.7" dur="6.419">and you know specifically like the the</text><text start="2658.14" dur="5.5">decentralized identity piece is is it&apos;s</text><text start="2661.119" dur="4.621">going to be key to kind of enabling this</text><text start="2663.64" dur="6.74">this decentralized this open</text><text start="2665.74" dur="7.44">permissionless qf or other protocol</text><text start="2670.38" dur="4.18">and so that yeah I think we&apos;re getting</text><text start="2673.18" dur="2.939">there you know it&apos;s still sort of an</text><text start="2674.56" dur="3.48">experiment we&apos;re still trying to like</text><text start="2676.119" dur="4.141">figure out the best solutions for</text><text start="2678.04" dur="4.14">decentralized identity but it&apos;s not like</text><text start="2680.26" dur="3.359">we always wanted grants to be</text><text start="2682.18" dur="4.26">centralized I think this was always sort</text><text start="2683.619" dur="4.921">of the goal to decentralize it but</text><text start="2686.44" dur="5.399">um that identity piece is sort of like</text><text start="2688.54" dur="6.539">the key thing that either makes or</text><text start="2691.839" dur="4.801">breaks a decentralized protocol</text><text start="2695.079" dur="3.0">yeah I think that that&apos;s certainly a</text><text start="2696.64" dur="3.42">theme on the podcast this year</text><text start="2698.079" dur="5.76">decentralized identity allows us to</text><text start="2700.06" dur="6.6">track our counterparties and uh you know</text><text start="2703.839" dur="4.561">in a privacy aware way so you know at</text><text start="2706.66" dur="3.419">least track who they are and build</text><text start="2708.4" dur="3.719">repeat interactions and positive some</text><text start="2710.079" dur="3.481">games on top of that and now Bitcoin</text><text start="2712.119" dur="2.881">passport is here and it&apos;s actually</text><text start="2713.56" dur="3.299">happening</text><text start="2715.0" dur="2.94">um we only have five minutes left so I&apos;m</text><text start="2716.859" dur="3.96">wondering if there&apos;s anything I didn&apos;t</text><text start="2717.94" dur="4.56">ask that anyone wants to say uh just</text><text start="2720.819" dur="3.0">keeping mindful that among the four of</text><text start="2722.5" dur="3.599">us that we only have five minutes left</text><text start="2723.819" dur="3.961">so Jenny and maybe I&apos;ll go to you next</text><text start="2726.099" dur="3.361">yeah I mean I think the big thing is</text><text start="2727.78" dur="3.539">like this round ahead it&apos;s about a start</text><text start="2729.46" dur="3.96">or it has already started when you&apos;re</text><text start="2731.319" dur="4.441">listening to this like please go donate</text><text start="2733.42" dur="4.26">like test it out give us feedback like</text><text start="2735.76" dur="3.359">we&apos;re still on the alpha stages of the</text><text start="2737.68" dur="4.439">protocol and we really want to build</text><text start="2739.119" dur="6.0">with the community so please help us</text><text start="2742.119" dur="6.361">like test it out give us feedback</text><text start="2745.119" dur="5.821">um we&apos;ll link to the donation links in</text><text start="2748.48" dur="5.879">the show notes so uh let&apos;s just make</text><text start="2750.94" dur="5.399">sure to make that happen and like go in</text><text start="2754.359" dur="4.201">these next two weeks donate to different</text><text start="2756.339" dur="4.561">grants we&apos;ve got a bunch of awesome</text><text start="2758.56" dur="3.539">grants in there um I stoked about who&apos;s</text><text start="2760.9" dur="4.38">actually going to be in these three</text><text start="2762.099" dur="5.401">rounds and like this whole thing happens</text><text start="2765.28" dur="4.5">and works well if we&apos;ve got a community</text><text start="2767.5" dur="4.02">that&apos;s donating and participating so</text><text start="2769.78" dur="3.839">like we couldn&apos;t do it without any of</text><text start="2771.52" dur="3.72">you guys helping with funding the</text><text start="2773.619" dur="4.041">projects that are most important in this</text><text start="2775.24" dur="2.42">ecosystem</text><text start="2777.76" dur="3.66">yeah and and maybe just to like very</text><text start="2780.099" dur="2.941">quickly step back because I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll</text><text start="2781.42" dur="3.78">have some people on this thinking like</text><text start="2783.04" dur="3.539">how can I get involved where do I apply</text><text start="2785.2" dur="4.02">et cetera and we haven&apos;t really talked</text><text start="2786.579" dur="5.76">about that but these these Alpha rounds</text><text start="2789.22" dur="5.04">uh we we put out a governance post and</text><text start="2792.339" dur="3.601">maybe we can link that or it&apos;s just</text><text start="2794.26" dur="4.559">discussion and feedback requests on the</text><text start="2795.94" dur="5.04">alpha rounds but these are not just open</text><text start="2798.819" dur="4.561">for brand new applications</text><text start="2800.98" dur="4.92">um of Grants unfortunately uh what what</text><text start="2803.38" dur="4.32">we decided sort of as as a down as a</text><text start="2805.9" dur="3.0">community is that you know for the for</text><text start="2807.7" dur="3.06">these early stage rounds as we&apos;re</text><text start="2808.9" dur="4.02">testing out the products and you know</text><text start="2810.76" dur="3.78">kind of civil and fraud prevention</text><text start="2812.92" dur="5.28">um we need to like sort of start small</text><text start="2814.54" dur="6.0">and grow so the three rounds uh web3</text><text start="2818.2" dur="5.94">open source ethereum infrastructure and</text><text start="2820.54" dur="5.819">climate Solutions uh are only open to a</text><text start="2824.14" dur="4.439">subset of grantees from the old platform</text><text start="2826.359" dur="4.321">the centralized grants platform and we</text><text start="2828.579" dur="3.841">set that threshold on the amount they&apos;ve</text><text start="2830.68" dur="4.32">raised in Prior rounds or the amount of</text><text start="2832.42" dur="4.74">unique donors and so we set out send out</text><text start="2835.0" dur="4.44">specific invites to to those existing</text><text start="2837.16" dur="5.939">grants to help was you know test out the</text><text start="2839.44" dur="5.34">new protocol and uh there were also new</text><text start="2843.099" dur="3.181">eligibility requirements so just because</text><text start="2844.78" dur="3.36">grants are invited doesn&apos;t mean they</text><text start="2846.28" dur="4.38">were automatically approved</text><text start="2848.14" dur="5.28">um but so these these are all kind of a</text><text start="2850.66" dur="4.199">a subset of existing projects</text><text start="2853.42" dur="2.82">um they all should be approved and live</text><text start="2854.859" dur="3.541">on the platform now so you can check</text><text start="2856.24" dur="3.96">them out and I&apos;m not sure if we</text><text start="2858.4" dur="6.78">mentioned this but these rounds each</text><text start="2860.2" dur="6.6">have a 333 000 matching pool or die so a</text><text start="2865.18" dur="3.72">million dollars in total so</text><text start="2866.8" dur="4.559">unfortunately it is too late to join the</text><text start="2868.9" dur="4.679">round however what we want people to do</text><text start="2871.359" dur="4.561">is to you know donate to test out the</text><text start="2873.579" dur="4.381">protocol you know try to break it try to</text><text start="2875.92" dur="3.84">test out weird edge cases and help us</text><text start="2877.96" dur="2.899">report bugs and improve the user</text><text start="2879.76" dur="4.14">experience</text><text start="2880.859" dur="4.781">and then come you know March April we&apos;ll</text><text start="2883.9" dur="3.48">be doing many more rounds that are kind</text><text start="2885.64" dur="4.62">of open to the broader
