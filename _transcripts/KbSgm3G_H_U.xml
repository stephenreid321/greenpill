dur="4.321">episode on the network state so tell us</text><text start="184.56" dur="4.0">about the network state uh what is it</text><text start="186.48" dur="4.8">why does it matter</text><text start="188.56" dur="5.12">so uh the network c is a new book um</text><text start="191.28" dur="5.56">that is in v1</text><text start="193.68" dur="6.0">meaning i am updating it it&apos;s at</text><text start="196.84" dur="5.8">thenetworkstate.com and um</text><text start="199.68" dur="3.919">the the fundamental concept behind it is</text><text start="202.64" dur="2.879">that</text><text start="203.599" dur="3.92">you know we&apos;ve started new companies</text><text start="205.519" dur="3.841">that&apos;s google and we started new</text><text start="207.519" dur="3.921">communities that&apos;s facebook and started</text><text start="209.36" dur="4.4">new currencies with</text><text start="211.44" dur="3.439">bitcoin and ethereum is it

really big</text><text start="220.319" dur="6.241">deal and that is sort of the in a sense</text><text start="223.68" dur="5.68">the cutting edge of social technology</text><text start="226.56" dur="4.399">in terms of using technology to align</text><text start="229.36" dur="3.76">people for</text><text start="230.959" dur="3.121">you know common good collective good etc</text><text start="233.12" dur="2.399">online</text><text start="234.08" dur="4.239">i think what i&apos;ve</text><text start="235.519" dur="5.841">tried to do in the book is talk about</text><text start="238.319" dur="3.84">a new emergence mode for</text><text start="241.36" dur="2.32">um</text><text start="242.159" dur="3.041">a state</text><text start="243.68" dur="4.88">and you know one way of thinking about</text><text start="245.2" dur="5.599">it is 2020 was arguably the year where</text><text start="248.56" dur="4.959">a big chunk of the world if not you know</text><text start="250.799" dur="3.921">the the elite of the world went digital</text><text start="253.519" dur="3.361">first</text><text start="254.72" dur="3.919">and so after 2020 things happened</text><text start="256.88" dur="4.0">digital first and physical second that&apos;s</text><text start="258.639" dur="5.041">not to say that physical isn&apos;t important</text><text start="260.88" dur="5.68">but physical is now a premium product</text><text start="263.68" dur="5.12">for example meetings occur digitally</text><text start="266.56" dur="3.28">first and only you know if you really</text><text start="268.8" dur="3.6">need them</text><text start="269.84" dur="5.359">do you physically go and fly in in</text><text start="272.4" dur="4.72">person conversations happen in whatsapp</text><text start="275.199" dur="4.56">groups and signal chats and only</text><text start="277.12" dur="5.84">very very uh high value ones or</text><text start="279.759" dur="5.361">infrequent ones happen in person and you</text><text start="282.96" dur="3.679">know currency for example i mean that&apos;s</text><text start="285.12" dur="3.44">that kind of flipped a while ago</text><text start="286.639" dur="4.0">communication flipped a while ago you</text><text start="288.56" dur="3.359">know and um</text><text start="290.639" dur="4.241">in the sense that probably most</text><text start="291.919" dur="5.041">communication was digital or electronic</text><text start="294.88" dur="3.599">and you know not printed out on a piece</text><text start="296.96" dur="3.2">of paper quite a while ago maybe maybe</text><text start="298.479" dur="3.28">even 10 years ago</text><text start="300.16" dur="3.68">but each of those are flippings and if</text><text start="301.759" dur="3.681">you had a graph of you know offline</text><text start="303.84" dur="3.76">versus online you know communication</text><text start="305.44" dur="4.88">goes and then transaction goes and so on</text><text start="307.6" dur="4.159">and so the the directional that is</text><text start="310.32" dur="3.52">digital first</text><text start="311.759" dur="3.841">and so uh you know how would that</text><text start="313.84" dur="4.24">exactly work lots of people have kind of</text><text start="315.6" dur="5.2">proposed sort of vague things or things</text><text start="318.08" dur="4.8">that i think are close but not exactly</text><text start="320.8" dur="4.16">right and i talk about why they&apos;re close</text><text start="322.88" dur="5.92">for example i don&apos;t think of facebook as</text><text start="324.96" dur="6.88">a network state or bitcoin or wework</text><text start="328.8" dur="4.399">they have aspects that are similar like</text><text start="331.84" dur="3.359">you know facebook has this huge</text><text start="333.199" dur="3.521">international community</text><text start="335.199" dur="3.681">but it doesn&apos;t have any collective</text><text start="336.72" dur="3.759">consciousness that is to say</text><text start="338.88" dur="3.12">those three something billion people do</text><text start="340.479" dur="3.041">not think of themselves as facebook</text><text start="342.0" dur="3.44">users do not think of zuck as their</text><text start="343.52" dur="3.92">leader he&apos;s just sort of</text><text start="345.44" dur="3.52">like almost the bar bar owner or</text><text start="347.44" dur="3.039">something like that they don&apos;t report to</text><text start="348.96" dur="3.6">him in a sense in the same way they do</text><text start="350.479" dur="3.28">to a president or to the chinese people</text><text start="352.56" dur="2.88">have a very different relationship with</text><text start="353.759" dur="2.88">xi jinping than facebook users due to</text><text start="355.44" dur="4.08">zuckerberg</text><text start="356.639" dur="4.801">facebook employees fold into zuckerberg</text><text start="359.52" dur="3.6">that&apos;s different you know they&apos;ve signed</text><text start="361.44" dur="3.52">a different social contract upon</text><text start="363.12" dur="4.079">entering and a big part of it is about</text><text start="364.96" dur="3.84">expectations it&apos;s possible that you know</text><text start="367.199" dur="2.801">zuck if he wanted to</text><text start="368.8" dur="3.92">could</text><text start="370.0" dur="3.759">um have not not a click-through but a</text><text start="372.72" dur="3.599">very</text><text start="373.759" dur="4.56">serious social smart contract that he</text><text start="376.319" dur="4.0">deployed to facebook members</text><text start="378.319" dur="3.521">that they sort of opted into governance</text><text start="380.319" dur="3.681">and what exactly would that mean so i&apos;ve</text><text start="381.84" dur="3.76">got the one sentence definition which is</text><text start="384.0" dur="3.68">a network state is a highly aligned</text><text start="385.6" dur="3.84">online community with a capacity for</text><text start="387.68" dur="2.959">collective action that crowdfunds</text><text start="389.44" dur="2.879">territory around the world and</text><text start="390.639" dur="3.761">eventually gains diplomatic recognition</text><text start="392.319" dur="4.0">from pre-existing states so highly</text><text start="394.4" dur="3.84">aligned online community meaning it&apos;s</text><text start="396.319" dur="3.761">not just a bunch of game of thrones fans</text><text start="398.24" dur="4.239">who have nothing in common but their</text><text start="400.08" dur="4.559">interest it is people who really have a</text><text start="402.479" dur="3.761">bunch of deep moral beliefs in common at</text><text start="404.639" dur="2.961">least one commandment in common but like</text><text start="406.24" dur="3.2">a serious thing</text><text start="407.6" dur="3.36">um a capacity for collective action so</text><text start="409.44" dur="3.44">again it&apos;s not just an online group it&apos;s</text><text start="410.96" dur="3.76">not just a bunch of disorganized</text><text start="412.88" dur="3.599">tweeters it is folks who can work</text><text start="414.72" dur="3.759">together and just to understand this</text><text start="416.479" dur="3.761">point which is why it&apos;s so important</text><text start="418.479" dur="3.681">if you have just 100 random people and</text><text start="420.24" dur="3.28">you tell them to go and burn something</text><text start="422.16" dur="3.36">down burn down a building i mentioned</text><text start="423.52" dur="3.6">this point in the book but</text><text start="425.52" dur="4.239">100 people you say go burn down that</text><text start="427.12" dur="5.199">house uh they can they can handle it</text><text start="429.759" dur="4.88">because you know one guy grabs a brick</text><text start="432.319" dur="4.0">and some guy grabs a torch and they go</text><text start="434.639" dur="3.921">to it if you tell those hundred people</text><text start="436.319" dur="4.0">go build a building</text><text start="438.56" dur="3.6">that&apos;s much harder</text><text start="440.319" dur="3.041">right because</text><text start="442.16" dur="3.68">um first of all they might not be able</text><text start="443.36" dur="4.8">to do it you&apos;re gonna need uh you know</text><text start="445.84" dur="4.72">cement and you&apos;re gonna need a plan and</text><text start="448.16" dur="4.879">not everybody can go after it at once</text><text start="450.56" dur="5.199">and you you&apos;ll need a foreman and some</text><text start="453.039" dur="3.921">blueprints and skilled electricians</text><text start="455.759" dur="3.28">basically</text><text start="456.96" dur="4.48">paralyzing building is much harder than</text><text start="459.039" dur="4.241">paralyzing destruction</text><text start="461.44" dur="4.4">and so what happens today is that the</text><text start="463.28" dur="4.72">collective action problems online i&apos;ve</text><text start="465.84" dur="3.68">written about this</text><text start="468.0" dur="4.0">are you know</text><text start="469.52" dur="4.0">are largely cancellation and destruction</text><text start="472.0" dur="3.36">and social mobbing and so on because</text><text start="473.52" dur="5.28">that&apos;s what the interfaces</text><text start="475.36" dur="6.16">of these uh you know like social media</text><text start="478.8" dur="5.119">programs allow you know but</text><text start="481.52" dur="3.84">it&apos;s also something that&apos;s fundamentally</text><text start="483.919" dur="3.361">easier to do</text><text start="485.36" dur="3.76">it&apos;s easier to destroy than to build for</text><text start="487.28" dur="4.16">the reasons i just outlined you know</text><text start="489.12" dur="3.759">like the it&apos;s good that building is</text><text start="491.44" dur="3.039">profitable or else</text><text start="492.879" dur="3.44">people wouldn&apos;t do it you know because</text><text start="494.479" dur="4.0">it&apos;s rewarding in all senses of the term</text><text start="496.319" dur="3.761">you know it&apos;s like you feel like you&apos;ve</text><text start="498.479" dur="3.28">accomplished something you know first</text><text start="500.08" dur="3.519">and foremost and you gain the money to</text><text start="501.759" dur="3.601">be able to do some more of it and so on</text><text start="503.599" dur="3.361">and so forth if that wasn&apos;t the case</text><text start="505.36" dur="2.959">it&apos;d be you know people just destroy</text><text start="506.96" dur="2.16">everything and you&apos;d have a some</text><text start="508.319" dur="2.56">world</text><text start="509.12" dur="4.159">so the the capacity for collective</text><text start="510.879" dur="3.921">action is a very non-trivial thing</text><text start="513.279" dur="3.521">cryptocurrency is a part of it but not</text><text start="514.8" dur="4.56">the only part i think leadership is a</text><text start="516.8" dur="3.84">part tasking is a part and the alignment</text><text start="519.36" dur="2.479">is very much a part that people have to</text><text start="520.64" dur="3.36">feel like they&apos;re they&apos;re there for the</text><text start="521.839" dur="3.601">same cause you can have all the tools</text><text start="524.0" dur="3.68">all the software but if the mental</text><text start="525.44" dur="3.839">software isn&apos;t there in people&apos;s heads</text><text start="527.68" dur="3.76">the shared values that underpin the</text><text start="529.279" dur="3.281">valuations if that isn&apos;t there then then</text><text start="531.44" dur="2.24">you&apos;re not there okay so it&apos;s a highly</text><text start="532.56" dur="2.8">aligned online community with the</text><text start="533.68" dur="3.12">capacity for collective action that</text><text start="535.36" dur="2.88">right there is what i&apos;d call a network</text><text start="536.8" dur="3.76">union a</text><text start="538.24" dur="4.159">digital union a group of people that</text><text start="540.56" dur="3.279">gets together and that does something</text><text start="542.399" dur="2.801">for their members

company</text><text start="710.0" dur="4.32">the implication is that it&apos;s early but</text><text start="712.48" dur="3.76">has you know aspirations of being great</text><text start="714.32" dur="3.68">okay or big</text><text start="716.24" dur="3.12">network union as a digital union that&apos;s</text><text start="718.0" dur="3.68">a group online with a capacity for</text><text

like this it&apos;s got</text><text start="726.72" dur="4.0">crowdfunded territory around the world</text><text start="728.72" dur="4.4">and those little pieces are all knit</text><text start="730.72" dur="4.16">together into something that feels like</text><text start="733.12" dur="2.8">the same territory</text><text start="734.88" dur="4.0">using</text><text start="735.92" dur="3.919">like the uh the capacity for</text><text start="738.88" dur="2.959">um</text><text start="739.839" dur="5.921">you know single sign-on and augmented</text><text start="741.839" dur="5.921">reality and so on that um that we that</text><text start="745.76" dur="3.519">we now have for example like just the</text><text start="747.76" dur="2.96">simplest version is you walk into any</text><text start="749.279"

dur="4.88">and um</text><text start="767.04" dur="3.44">if you go a little bit further the uh</text><text start="769.519" dur="3.281">you know</text><text start="770.48" dur="3.919">into what&apos;s coming i think um just like</text><text start="772.8" dur="4.479">the iphone was sort of predictable if</text><text start="774.399" dur="4.0">you were following mobile in the 2000s</text><text

start="782.24" dur="4.08">that look like glasses but that you can</text><text start="784.639" dur="2.561">tap you know like snapchat speckles i</text><text start="786.32" dur="3.519">talked about this is one of the most</text><text start="787.2" dur="4.0">predictable outcomes of the book or of</text><text start="789.839" dur="4.081">technology</text><text start="791.2" dur="4.56">those glasses</text><text start="793.92" dur="3.599">are um</text><text start="795.76" dur="3.68">are something that will allow</text><text start="797.519" dur="3.921">since people will wear them all the time</text><text start="799.44" dur="4.24">and deliver them in a heads-up way it</text><text start="801.44" dur="3.519">actually adds in a sense even more</text><text start="803.68" dur="2.8">online time because you don&apos;t need to</text><text start="804.959" dur="2.88">pick up your phone anymore you can just</text><text start="806.48" dur="2.479">tap your glasses and sort of just</text><text start="807.839" dur="3.281">basically be</text><text start="808.959" dur="4.641">you have your hands free and you&apos;re</text><text start="811.12" dur="4.959">online and guess what you can see</text><text start="813.6" dur="4.32">augmented reality ghosts or projections</text><text start="816.079" dur="6.0">from other people in your network state</text><text start="817.92" dur="6.479">or startup society in your zone</text><text start="822.079" dur="3.76">and talk to them as if they were there</text><text start="824.399" dur="3.201">and if you think about it most of your</text><text start="825.839" dur="4.081">interface with another human being i</text><text start="827.6" dur="4.239">mean sometimes of course you want to</text><text start="829.92" dur="2.64">like you know give them a hug or you</text><text start="831.839" dur="2.161">know</text><text start="832.56" dur="3.36">like you know high five or something</text><text start="834.0" dur="4.639">like that but a big chunk of it is</text><text start="835.92" dur="3.68">basically hands off it&apos;s audio visual</text><text start="838.639" dur="2.801">and so</text><text start="839.6" dur="4.799">you know as i said digital first and</text><text start="841.44" dur="5.28">physical is a premium product right like</text><text start="844.399" dur="4.401">you know for a lot of daily purposes</text><text start="846.72" dur="3.359">you know digital would be sufficient and</text><text start="848.8" dur="2.96">all these people</text><text start="850.079" dur="4.0">they you could imagine actually some</text><text start="851.76" dur="4.72">sort of 2030 zoom</text><text start="854.079" dur="3.921">that um used</text><text start="856.48" dur="3.76">you know various kinds of signals so</text><text start="858.0" dur="4.72">that you had a bunch of people in four</text><text start="860.24" dur="3.44">different locations sitting around table</text><text start="862.72" dur="2.32">but</text><text start="863.68" dur="3.2">the other three were in different</text><text start="865.04" dur="2.88">locations</text><text start="866.88" dur="2.72">you know what i&apos;m saying and it&apos;s like</text><text start="867.92" dur="3.44">telepresence yeah telepresence of an</text><text start="869.6" dur="3.919">augmented reality kind right where you</text><text start="871.36" dur="3.919">didn&apos;t even need to right so the point</text><text start="873.519" dur="5.68">is you know those are things like uh you</text><text start="875.279" dur="5.841">know ens uh unlocking of doors right or</text><text start="879.199" dur="4.0">um making have you seen ar kit like</text><text start="881.12" dur="3.839">sigils hovering in midair where you have</text><text start="883.199" dur="3.601">to hold an nft you see a sigil there</text><text start="884.959" dur="3.601">that indicates that this startup society</text><text start="886.8" dur="3.2">has a territory so you start thinking</text><text start="888.56" dur="3.92">about essentially</text><text start="890.0" dur="4.8">the augmented reality slash transfer you</text><text start="892.48" dur="4.56">know such enos based transformation of</text><text

dur="3.359">ar glasses showed to be a nondescript</text><text start="911.76" dur="4.56">building</text><text start="913.519" dur="4.801">okay so the return of secret societies</text><text start="916.32" dur="3.12">um but at scale it&apos;s really secret</text><text start="918.32" dur="2.319">states</text><text start="919.44" dur="3.199">okay so</text><text start="920.639" dur="5.041">this is kind of very you know it&apos;s very</text><text start="922.639" dur="4.401">satoshi it&apos;s very cryptocurrency it uh</text><text start="925.68" dur="3.2">you know one of the things about that</text><text start="927.04" dur="3.76">graph that i just showed is that&apos;s a lot</text><text start="928.88" dur="3.68">of nodes there but guess what not all of</text><text start="930.8" dur="3.2">them have to be world visible they could</text><text start="932.56" dur="3.279">have different levels of visibility some</text><text start="934.0" dur="3.279">of them could be encrypted some of them</text><text start="935.839" dur="4.161">in the sense that you can only see them</text><text start="937.279" dur="4.0">if you have you know an nft if you&apos;re if</text><text

then you can see</text><text start="945.44" dur="4.72">the um</text><text start="947.759" dur="5.44">you know the the jerusalem or the</text><text start="950.16" dur="4.4">uh the rome of that startup society</text><text start="953.199" dur="2.961">right you can see the you know the</text><text start="954.56" dur="4.16">capital city basically are capital</text><text start="956.16" dur="3.599">cities perhaps right</text><text start="958.72" dur="4.239">and</text><text start="959.759" dur="4.961">uh so so that&apos;s the crowdfund territory</text><text start="962.959" dur="3.041">around the world and the last bit is</text><text start="964.72" dur="3.76">actually really important eventually</text><text start="966.0" dur="3.279">gains diplomatic recognition</text><text start="968.48" dur="3.359">um</text><text start="969.279" dur="4.24">from pre-existing states so why do i</text><text start="971.839" dur="3.761">include something like that see this is</text><text start="973.519" dur="4.401">why i would never call myself</text><text start="975.6" dur="4.239">you know a libertarian in a you know</text><text start="977.92" dur="3.76">there&apos;s certain libertarian ideals that</text><text start="979.839" dur="3.521">i understand and i think have you know</text><text start="981.68" dur="3.599">have been useful in the same way there&apos;s</text><text start="983.36" dur="3.68">certain liberal ideas conservative ideas</text><text start="985.279" dur="2.56">you know even anarchist heads that i</text><text

dur="3.839">contributed something but the thing is</text><text start="992.48" dur="4.56">that the sort of the</text><text start="994.639" dur="4.0">i&apos;ll just poke at you know the naive</text><text start="997.04" dur="3.44">libertarian who you know made me</text><text start="998.639" dur="2.64">consider themselves such okay</text><text start="1000.48" dur="2.719">um</text><text start="1001.279" dur="4.081">really thinks they can go and just</text><text start="1003.199" dur="4.64">you know put a flag on some</text><text start="1005.36" dur="4.56">weird edge territory and then call</text><text start="1007.839" dur="3.761">themselves you know the president of</text><text start="1009.92" dur="3.039">something right and of course the issue</text><text start="1011.6" dur="3.12">with this is</text><text start="1012.959" dur="3.44">you know them and what army but as they</text><text start="1014.72" dur="3.919">talk about actually it&apos;s not just them</text><text start="1016.399" dur="3.601">and one army it&apos;s really</text><text start="1018.639" dur="3.921">them and what</text><text start="1020.0" dur="4.64">nation them and what country right um</text><text start="1022.56" dur="3.759">what group considers themselves the</text><text start="1024.64" dur="3.36">natural inhabitants of this land what</text><text start="1026.319" dur="3.681">nation is there right just like a</text><text start="1028.0" dur="3.36">cryptocurrency if you just considered</text><text start="1030.0" dur="3.28">yourself to have a zillion dollars or</text><text start="1031.36" dur="3.04">whatever no one would care but if</text><text start="1033.28" dur="2.88">there&apos;s a community around you that</text><text start="1034.4" dur="4.08">gives

recognition</text><text start="1047.199" dur="4.561">is really important because</text><text start="1050.24" dur="4.08">um what does that mean it means it could</text><text start="1051.76" dur="4.24">be a city like miami it could be a a</text><text start="1054.32" dur="3.12">internal jurisdiction like you know</text><text start="1056.0" dur="2.799">province or what have you like texas</text><text start="1057.44" dur="2.96">funny called texas province but because</text><text start="1058.799" dur="3.361">i use the term state otherwise right it</text><text start="1060.4" dur="4.08">could be an internal administrative</text><text start="1062.16" dur="4.08">division um or it could actually be a</text><text start="1064.48" dur="3.84">sovereign country like el

dur="3.121">hey look here&apos;s the live network stats</text><text start="1265.84" dur="3.92">of this and it helped us bootstrap</text><text start="1267.28" dur="4.56">legitimacy which is reflective

doing</text><text start="1288.08" dur="3.76">and</text><text start="1288.96" dur="6.079">you know one thing is i&apos;ve always been</text><text start="1291.84" dur="5.68">a believer in the use of web3 to</text><text start="1295.039" dur="4.481">uh build genuine ties between people not</text><text start="1297.52" dur="3.039">just speculation and stuff like that i</text><text start="1299.52" dur="2.72">mean</text><text start="1300.559" dur="3.281">i i think of speculation is it&apos;s like</text><text start="1302.24" dur="2.72">okay that it&apos;s out there but it has to</text><text start="1303.84" dur="2.24">be sort of</text><text start="1304.96" dur="3.04">um</text><text start="1306.08" dur="2.959">you know connected the liquidity and all</text><text start="1308.0" dur="2.799">the financial engineering should be</text><text start="1309.039" dur="3.921">connected to something of</text><text start="1310.799" dur="4.081">impact right yeah and and you know</text><text start="1312.96" dur="3.76">sometimes it can be for example like</text><text start="1314.88" dur="3.44">commodities futures uh you know</text><text start="1316.72" dur="3.52">initially agricultural futures you have</text><text start="1318.32" dur="4.32">a farmer and they&apos;ve got a crop and</text><text start="1320.24" dur="3.679">they&apos;ve got an uncertain future price</text><text start="1322.64" dur="2.88">you know for that crop they don&apos;t know</text><text start="1323.919" dur="4.481">if their potatoes are going to be worth</text><text start="1325.52" dur="5.68">10 bucks or one buck but three bucks</text><text start="1328.4" dur="5.12">they can pay their rent and and so on so</text><text start="1331.2" dur="4.32">they sell the futures at three bucks and</text><text start="1333.52" dur="3.68">then some guy with deep pockets</text><text start="1335.52" dur="3.76">um you know does the other side of that</text><text start="1337.2" dur="3.599">transaction and they</text><text start="1339.28" dur="3.519">book the upside in the event that it</text><text start="1340.799" dur="3.681">goes to 10 they make seven dollars per</text><text start="1342.799" dur="2.801">but they also take the downside loss</text><text start="1344.48" dur="2.8">they&apos;re basically a risk-on they&apos;re</text><text start="1345.6" dur="2.48">buying the risk their guy is selling the</text><text start="1347.28" dur="2.72">risk</text><text start="1348.08" dur="3.839">that&apos;s a totally reasonable</text><text start="1350.0" dur="3.039">thing for you know finance that&apos;s a good</text><text start="1351.919" dur="2.961">thing and there&apos;s lots of other things</text><text start="1353.039" dur="4.961">in finance you know interest rates and</text><text start="1354.88" dur="5.52">you know npv and being able to transform</text><text start="1358.0" dur="4.32">cash flows all that stuff is good</text><text start="1360.4" dur="3.68">but it&apos;s just something where it&apos;s like</text><text start="1362.32" dur="3.92">you don&apos;t want to build this house of</text><text start="1364.08" dur="3.68">cards on top but nothing too much so the</text><text start="1366.24" dur="3.28">foundation there is the physical product</text><text start="1367.76" dur="3.6">so we want to be actually creating a lot</text><text start="1369.52" dur="4.56">of these features on physical yams not</text><text start="1371.36" dur="5.439">digital ems</text><text start="1374.08" dur="5.36">so it&apos;s funny you say it i actually say</text><text start="1376.799" dur="5.281">in this case the foundation is the moral</text><text start="1379.44" dur="5.119">fiber that binds the community</text><text start="1382.08" dur="4.16">okay because the humans ultimately are</text><text start="1384.559" dur="2.48">what are sort of upstream of the whole</text><text start="1386.24" dur="2.559">thing</text><text start="1387.039" dur="3.441">any physical stuff will come out of</text><text start="1388.799" dur="4.481">their effort</text><text start="1390.48" dur="4.96">and you know one one concept i have is</text><text start="1393.28" dur="4.08">you know like an uptime tracker</text><text start="1395.44" dur="4.88">mm-hmm you know like that it&apos;s like it&apos;s</text><text start="1397.36" dur="4.88">ping ping it&apos;s like supposed to be at 99</text><text start="1400.32" dur="5.76">yeah yeah exactly so one concept i have</text><text start="1402.24" dur="5.84">is a moral uptime tracker okay so like a</text><text start="1406.08" dur="4.24">like a tracking poll will judge</text><text start="1408.08" dur="4.959">sentiment over time and then sentiment</text><text start="1410.32" dur="5.04">can fall off a cliff okay</text><text start="1413.039" dur="4.561">and uh you know i&apos;ve got um</text><text start="1415.36" dur="4.4">you know i&apos;m sure can screencaster or</text><text start="1417.6" dur="3.679">can can you can you project some images</text><text start="1419.76" dur="2.96">i&apos;m not sure if you can i don&apos;t think</text><text start="1421.279" dur="3.041">you can unfortunately but if you link</text><text start="1422.72" dur="3.36">the image here we can put in the show</text><text start="1424.32" dur="3.359">notes maybe we can just speak to it in</text><text start="1426.08" dur="3.36">the meantime all right i&apos;ll speak to it</text><text start="1427.679" dur="3.6">so basically um</text><text start="1429.44" dur="3.2">there&apos;s a graph which shows so</text><text start="1431.279" dur="3.681">everybody&apos;s familiar with like the graph</text><text start="1432.64" dur="4.48">of like a like a stable coin losing its</text><text start="1434.96" dur="4.0">peg now unfortunately</text><text start="1437.12" dur="3.679">unfortunately yes unfortunately so that</text><text start="1438.96" dur="4.319">happens over the course of like a few</text><text start="1440.799" dur="3.521">hours right basically a day now there&apos;s</text><text start="1443.279" dur="3.441">another graph that actually kind of</text><text start="1444.32" dur="4.239">looks like that it&apos;s a it&apos;s a gallup</text><text start="1446.72" dur="3.199">poll church membership among us adults</text><text start="1448.559" dur="3.36">now below 50</text><text start="1449.919" dur="4.481">okay and it&apos;s something where it&apos;s like</text><text start="1451.919" dur="4.24">stable at like 75 for a long time in the</text><text start="1454.4" dur="4.0">last few years has just catastrophically</text><text start="1456.159" dur="4.081">fallen off a cliff to like sub 47 and</text><text start="1458.4" dur="5.04">keeps declining okay</text><text start="1460.24" dur="4.88">the time scale is not um you know a few</text><text start="1463.44" dur="4.56">hours it&apos;s not one day it&apos;s like 70</text><text start="1465.12" dur="5.52">years right so it is you know thousands</text><text start="1468.0" dur="3.84">of x creator but in a sense it&apos;s similar</text><text start="1470.64" dur="4.08">because it&apos;s</text><text start="1471.84" dur="4.319">you know something losing its peg</text><text start="1474.72" dur="3.52">that thing that people thought was a</text><text start="1476.159" dur="3.201">constant is becoming a variable</text><text start="1478.24" dur="4.24">okay</text><text start="1479.36" dur="6.559">and so uh you know it it was okay if it</text><text start="1482.48" dur="4.96">fluctuated like 75 76 72 lots of things</text><text start="1485.919" dur="2.721">could be taken for granted once it was</text><text start="1487.44" dur="2.479">there but when you undercut the</text><text start="1488.64" dur="3.519">foundations</text><text start="1489.919" dur="4.801">now you have people who just</text><text start="1492.159" dur="4.0">fundamentally disagree on core</text><text start="1494.72" dur="3.12">principles you can&apos;t take that for</text><text start="1496.159" dur="3.041">granted anymore right</text><text start="1497.84" dur="3.68">and um</text><text start="1499.2" dur="4.079">it&apos;s also trust in government looks not</text><text start="1501.52" dur="4.24">exactly the same but similar it&apos;s a long</text><text start="1503.279" dur="4.4">slide and now it&apos;s in like the 20s in</text><text start="1505.76" dur="4.56">terms of people trust in government for</text><text start="1507.679" dur="5.36">generations okay yeah</text><text start="1510.32" dur="4.719">and you know the thing about this is</text><text start="1513.039" dur="4.24">you start thinking okay what if uh you</text><text start="1515.039" dur="3.681">know your community has a moral uptime</text><text start="1517.279" dur="3.361">tracker you have certain moral</text><text start="1518.72" dur="2.959">principles i&apos;m not saying to be clear</text><text start="1520.64" dur="2.56">they don&apos;t have to be like the ten</text><text start="1521.679" dur="2.88">commandments or what have you but one of</text><text start="1523.2" dur="2.8">the points to make is you probably want</text><text start="1524.559" dur="2.561">a one commandment</text><text start="1526.0" dur="3.679">something</text><text start="1527.12" dur="6.64">that your community right some you know</text><text start="1529.679" dur="6.24">uh it could be for for get coin that um</text><text start="1533.76" dur="3.84">i don&apos;t know collective uh you know</text><text start="1535.919" dur="2.88">collective self-sacrifice is good or</text><text start="1537.6" dur="2.8">something like that yeah i don&apos;t know</text><text start="1538.799" dur="4.161">building fund public goods is i think</text><text start="1540.4" dur="4.639">bitcoin&apos;s one commandment great okay and</text><text start="1542.96" dur="4.64">then you have derivations from that you</text><text start="1545.039" dur="4.88">know open source is good and yeah being</text><text start="1547.6" dur="3.92">civil to people online is good and so on</text><text start="1549.919" dur="3.521">and so forth right you have various</text><text start="1551.52" dur="4.24">derivations from that that follow from</text><text start="1553.44" dur="4.4">that first thing and you can this</text><text start="1555.76" dur="3.84">is probably one of those derivations</text><text start="1557.84" dur="3.92">it&apos;s discovering like what regen web 3</text><text start="1559.6" dur="3.52">could look like yeah there you go right</text><text start="1561.76" dur="4.56">so</text><text start="1563.12" dur="5.6">the the thing is that basically um</text><text start="1566.32" dur="2.4">the uh</text><text start="1568.84" dur="4.76">the problem is that um</text><text start="1574.24" dur="3.439">many people have those moral premises</text><text start="1576.4" dur="3.279">implicit</text><text start="1577.679" dur="4.561">uh at companies it&apos;s interesting you</text><text start="1579.679" dur="4.641">know the many companies have</text><text start="1582.24" dur="4.16">you know they talk about company culture</text><text start="1584.32" dur="3.52">and company culture becomes explicit</text><text start="1586.4" dur="3.2">when you&apos;re beyond a certain scale where</text><text start="1587.84" dur="3.839">it needs to be conveyed</text><text start="1589.6" dur="4.4">you know here&apos;s how we do things we do</text><text start="1591.679" dur="4.0">it x y and the most trivial is you know</text><text start="1594.0" dur="4.08">we&apos;re using google docs rather than word</text><text start="1595.679" dur="3.921">and we&apos;re using uh you know twitter</text><text start="1598.08" dur="4.479">rather than instagram and so and so</text><text start="1599.6" dur="2.959">forth those are just sort of like</text><text start="1603.44" dur="4.479">symptoms rather than the the cause</text><text start="1606.32" dur="2.88">yeah but basically those are those are</text><text start="1607.919" dur="3.601">useful because they&apos;re explicitly</text><text start="1609.2" dur="3.92">articulable you know and they&apos;re some of</text><text start="1611.52" dur="3.92">them are more substantive you can think</text><text start="1613.12" dur="3.919">of culture as a set of sliders like i&apos;m</text><text start="1615.44" dur="4.719">a full in-person company or a full</text><text start="1617.039" dur="4.961">remote company right yeah i i pay market</text><text start="1620.159" dur="4.561">compensation or highly equity-based and</text><text start="1622.0" dur="4.24">so it&apos;s like all of those are sliders</text><text start="1624.72" dur="3.839">that you can set and different</text><text start="1626.24" dur="3.36">combinations will work it you know</text><text start="1628.559" dur="4.0">it&apos;s not that there&apos;s any one</text><text start="1629.6" dur="4.72">combination that works and</text><text start="1632.559" dur="3.761">the thing is that culture is a set of</text><text start="1634.32" dur="3.76">sliders you know culture is this thing</text><text start="1636.32" dur="4.079">that is less important</text><text start="1638.08" dur="3.599">as like a

dur="3.76">category of that is</text><text start="2030.72" dur="3.439">how do we increase our capacity for</text><text start="2032.64" dur="3.039">collective action within these nation</text><text start="2034.159" dur="4.0">states how do we build public</text><text start="2035.679" dur="4.081">infrastructure within these these nation</text><text start="2038.159" dur="4.561">states how do we

start="2044.84" dur="3.48">past so within existing nation states</text><text start="2046.88" dur="3.6">are you saying or</text><text start="2048.32" dur="3.92">yeah well well i mean i guess like</text><text start="2050.48" dur="3.52">network states or nation states i mean</text><text start="2052.24" dur="3.359">my theory is basically forkable open</text><text start="2054.0" dur="3.2">source software is powerful because we</text><text start="2055.599" dur="3.52">can build smart contracts that solve the</text><text start="2057.2" dur="3.28">prisoner&apos;s dilemma and

dur="3.52">community your community can bootstrap</text><text start="2063.52" dur="3.44">its own like prisoners dilemma solving</text><text start="2065.28" dur="3.28">coordination tools i guess i want to</text><text start="2066.96" dur="2.959">hear your take on these things totally</text><text start="2068.56" dur="3.76">totally so actually</text><text start="2069.919" dur="3.841">a couple of things one is um you know</text><text start="2072.32" dur="3.039">i&apos;ll probably have like a longer answer</text><text start="2073.76" dur="3.599">for telecom a very thoughtful review and</text><text start="2075.359" dur="3.441">so on one thing he talks about is how</text><text start="2077.359" dur="2.641">he&apos;d like to see more on exit to</text><text start="2078.8" dur="3.44">community and actually i do have a whole</text><text start="2080.0" dur="3.919">section on m a of network states and how</text><text start="2082.24" dur="3.52">a founder can hang up the cleats and so</text><text start="2083.919" dur="4.48">on and so forth but another thing is not</text><text start="2085.76" dur="4.48">just exit to community but exit to world</text><text start="2088.399" dur="3.601">which is open sourcing the whole thing</text><text start="2090.24" dur="3.679">and having anybody have it right so</text><text start="2092.0" dur="3.599">rather than one founder giving it to end</text><text start="2093.919" dur="4.081">people a community he gives it to</text><text start="2095.599" dur="3.921">everybody which is exit to world right</text><text start="2098.0" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="2099.52" dur="2.559">so that&apos;s kind of one part the other</text><text start="2100.88" dur="2.64">part is you&apos;re saying how can you help</text><text start="2102.079" dur="2.241">existing nations existing neuroscience</text><text start="2103.52" dur="2.559">well</text><text start="2104.32" dur="3.519">it kind of you know not all nation</text><text start="2106.079" dur="3.601">states are in the same in my view</text><text start="2107.839" dur="4.0">negative shape but first of all the term</text><text start="2109.68" dur="4.48">nation state people use it as a compound</text><text start="2111.839" dur="3.76">noun but for example you know maybe</text><text start="2114.16" dur="2.48">maybe if you&apos;ve read it do you know the</text><text start="2115.599" dur="2.641">difference between the nation and the</text><text start="2116.64" dur="3.92">state</text><text start="2118.24" dur="3.76">yeah so i think that the state is is</text><text start="2120.56" dur="2.799">sort of like the bureaucracy that</text><text start="2122.0" dur="3.52">organizes things but there&apos;s different</text><text start="2123.359" dur="3.441">nations within states so like the reds</text><text start="2125.52" dur="3.04">and the blues in the united states or</text><text start="2126.8" dur="3.36">the kurds within the iraqis is the</text><text start="2128.56" dur="3.279">example that you that you get yeah</text><text start="2130.16" dur="3.12">exactly and so the thing is that&apos;s right</text><text start="2131.839" dur="3.041">that&apos;s right so basically the nation it</text><text start="2133.28" dur="3.68">comes from like the same kind of root</text><text start="2134.88" dur="4.239">word as natality like common birth</text><text

start="2307.04" dur="3.92">yeah exactly and and the thing is if you</text><text start="2308.48" dur="3.52">look at crypto tribalism or you look at</text><text start="2310.96" dur="2.879">eunuchs</text><text start="2312.0" dur="4.48">or you look at you know there&apos;s certain</text><text start="2313.839" dur="5.201">aspects of human nature with the</text><text start="2316.48" dur="4.24">fissioning and factionalization and so</text><text start="2319.04" dur="4.16">on like you have something really big</text><text start="2320.72" dur="4.119">and you know communism splits and you</text><text start="2323.2" dur="4.72">know so and so forth right</text><text start="2324.839" dur="4.681">um and so you you get go ahead</text><text start="2327.92" dur="3.28">yeah yeah i was going to say i was going</text><text start="2329.52" dur="4.079">to sort of combine it also to crypto and</text><text start="2331.2" dur="3.68">say like as long as you&apos;re a regen web 3</text><text start="2333.599" dur="3.681">etherean</text><text start="2334.88" dur="4.08">uh and not a dj ethereum then you&apos;re</text><text start="2337.28" dur="4.4">fine with b and i won&apos;t yeah yeah yeah</text><text start="2338.96" dur="4.8">exactly exactly and you know what the</text><text start="2341.68" dur="3.36">thing about this is</text><text start="2343.76" dur="2.88">once you start thinking about those</text><text start="2345.04" dur="3.2">scissor statements and and just to</text><text start="2346.64" dur="2.88">clarify you should google this it&apos;s like</text><text start="2348.24" dur="3.44">um</text><text start="2349.52" dur="3.839">sort by controversial create short story</text><text start="2351.68" dur="2.96">by scott sky alexander so scissor</text><text start="2353.359" dur="2.641">statements</text><text start="2354.64" dur="3.28">are a statement that</text><text start="2356.0" dur="3.119">like basically one group he says one</text><text start="2357.92" dur="4.32">group thinks is true and the other group</text><text start="2359.119" dur="4.161">thinks is false um but but you know they</text><text start="2362.24" dur="2.48">both think it&apos;s obviously true or</text><text start="2363.28" dur="4.079">obviously false i won&apos;t even repeat a</text><text start="2364.72" dur="4.08">scissor statement here um</text><text start="2367.359" dur="3.041">actually you know a good example of one</text><text start="2368.8" dur="3.84">that&apos;s less hot today but that was a big</text><text start="2370.4" dur="3.439">deal like 15 years ago did iraq have</text><text start="2372.64" dur="2.08">wmds</text><text start="2373.839" dur="2.881">right</text><text start="2374.72" dur="3.52">like so that was something which you</text><text start="2376.72" dur="4.08">know some group thought was obviously</text><text start="2378.24" dur="3.839">true because you know like the un said</text><text start="2380.8" dur="3.279">this and that and their group says</text><text start="2382.079" dur="4.721">obviously false and you know blah blah</text><text start="2384.079" dur="3.76">blah and so that&apos;s a great example of</text><text start="2386.8" dur="2.72">something that just gets people</text><text start="2387.839" dur="2.721">bickering because one group thinks it&apos;s</text><text start="2389.52" dur="2.48">obviously true that our group thinks</text><text start="2390.56" dur="2.88">it&apos;s obviously false</text><text start="2392.0" dur="2.4">and so you want to minimize i mean</text><text start="2393.44" dur="2.88">there&apos;s different ways of dealing with</text><text start="2394.4" dur="4.32">this right one is to not allow anybody</text><text start="2396.32" dur="4.48">to say any sister statements okay that&apos;s</text><text start="2398.72" dur="3.92">actually not at you know whether by</text><text start="2400.8" dur="2.799">convention or so on people you have this</text><text start="2402.64" dur="3.6">convention like don&apos;t talk about</text><text start="2403.599" dur="4.401">religion or politics you know um so that</text><text start="2406.24" dur="3.28">was like kind of one thing</text><text start="2408.0" dur="2.96">the then with social media everybody</text><text start="2409.52" dur="2.72">could talk about anything and this these</text><text start="2410.96" dur="2.879">seem to be some of the most engaging</text><text start="2412.24" dur="3.52">topics so they got a lot of engagements</text><text start="2413.839" dur="4.081">they scissored up the whole country and</text><text start="2415.76" dur="4.16">and you know so on and so forth right</text><text start="2417.92" dur="4.48">the second possibility is you select</text><text start="2419.92" dur="4.56">people on scissor statements and so</text><text start="2422.4" dur="3.84">they uh you know these are like boolean</text><text start="2424.48" dur="3.44">variables and let&apos;s say each one cuts</text><text start="2426.24" dur="4.079">not exactly 50 of the population but it</text><text start="2427.92" dur="4.24">cuts into two so maybe this is a 30 70</text><text start="2430.319" dur="3.681">split and a 20 80 split and now you&apos;re</text><text start="2432.16" dur="3.28">down to this group of people that agrees</text><text start="2434.0" dur="3.52">with you on all these core premises and</text><text start="2435.44" dur="3.679">they really agree with you etc okay</text><text start="2437.52" dur="3.599">great and the third possibility is</text><text start="2439.119" dur="3.761">something like the synonymous economy</text><text start="2441.119" dur="3.761">where you only disclose those aspects</text><text start="2442.88" dur="4.16">that people really need to know and all</text><text start="2444.88" dur="4.0">the rest is done through cryptography</text><text start="2447.04" dur="4.48">and whatnot and you bring your minimum</text><text start="2448.88" dur="4.16">necessary self to work recognizing that</text><text start="2451.52" dur="2.4">you know there&apos;s something that you know</text><text start="2453.04" dur="2.559">you</text><text start="2453.92" dur="4.0">you basically just don&apos;t want to know</text><text start="2455.599" dur="4.321">it&apos;s uh you heard the term tmi too much</text><text start="2457.92" dur="3.28">information yeah right yeah</text><text start="2459.92" dur="3.36">you literally don&apos;t want to know and</text><text start="2461.2" dur="4.0">it&apos;s different sense of tmi right</text><text start="2463.28" dur="5.68">and um</text><text start="2465.2" dur="4.96">so the the point being that um</text><text start="2468.96" dur="3.119">scissor statements are something to</text><text start="2470.16" dur="4.159">manage for collective action it&apos;s not</text><text start="2472.079" dur="4.801">just about the tools that&apos;s the software</text><text start="2474.319" dur="4.321">it&apos;s about the beliefs in people&apos;s heads</text><text start="2476.88" dur="3.36">the intellectual software you know their</text><text start="2478.64" dur="3.36">morals and their beliefs and alignment</text><text start="2480.24" dur="3.839">what they think of as good and bad</text><text start="2482.0" dur="3.68">yeah so it seems like in order to you</text><text start="2484.079" dur="2.721">you kind of want to close the scissor so</text><text start="2485.68" dur="2.96">we can do that with zero knowledge</text><text start="2486.8" dur="3.68">cryptography bottoms up open source</text><text start="2488.64" dur="3.679">software that creates cooperation across</text><text start="2490.48" dur="4.48">distance and it seems like to me the</text><text start="2492.319" dur="4.0">opportunity here is to create bottoms-up</text><text start="2494.96" dur="3.28">coordination</text><text start="2496.319" dur="3.841">in the nation as opposed to just the</text><text start="2498.24" dur="3.76">top-down coordination</text><text start="2500.16" dur="3.84">that has come from the state in the past</text><text start="2502.0" dur="4.48">and so it bottoms up public goods that</text><text start="2504.0" dur="4.56">creates cooperation across distance</text><text start="2506.48" dur="4.0">with these like scissored groups it</text><text start="2508.56" dur="5.12">feels like the opportunity for me with</text><text start="2510.48" dur="5.2">web3 and with with network states uh</text><text start="2513.68" dur="3.52">i&apos;d be curious to your reaction to that</text><text start="2515.68" dur="3.36">i think that&apos;s good i&apos;m definitely</text><text start="2517.2" dur="4.08">supportive of building organic</text><text start="2519.04" dur="3.84">communities um and you know the thing is</text><text start="2521.28" dur="3.839">like localism</text><text start="2522.88" dur="4.08">is kind of a good concept except i think</text><text start="2525.119" dur="3.041">you need a digital localism because most</text><text start="2526.96" dur="3.04">people</text><text start="2528.16" dur="3.679">don&apos;t know their neighbors anymore you</text><text start="2530.0" dur="3.68">know but they know people who are their</text><text start="2531.839" dur="3.121">social network neighbors</text><text start="2533.68" dur="2.96">right so their neighbors in the in the</text><text start="2534.96" dur="3.44">network state well their neighbors in</text><text start="2536.64" dur="2.719">the cloud become their neighbors on the</text><text start="2538.4" dur="2.56">earth</text><text start="2539.359" dur="2.881">right right so because they group</text><text start="2540.96" dur="3.68">together they have common values and</text><text start="2542.24" dur="4.32">they get you know some plot of land in</text><text start="2544.64" dur="3.12">ohio or something like that you have sub</text><text start="2546.56" dur="3.12">community sub networks within the</text><text start="2547.76" dur="2.88">network i mean one way of thinking about</text><text start="2549.68" dur="3.679">it is</text><text start="2550.64" dur="4.479">um i go through a bunch of different</text><text start="2553.359" dur="3.361">authors who have thought about what is a</text><text start="2555.119" dur="3.441">nation and they have it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="2556.72" dur="5.44">the tale and the snout and so on of the</text><text start="2558.56" dur="4.72">elephant they&apos;re like oh a nation is um</text><text start="2562.16" dur="3.28">go ahead</text><text start="2563.28" dur="3.44">oh it&apos;s just going to explain the uh</text><text start="2565.44" dur="2.96">analogy that you made there where you&apos;ve</text><text start="2566.72" dur="4.399">got five blind men and an elephant and</text><text start="2568.4" dur="4.64">one of them grabs it says and says</text><text start="2571.119" dur="3.601">he grabs the trunk and says this is a</text><text start="2573.04" dur="3.279">tree and then another grabs the tusk and</text><text start="2574.72" dur="3.44">says this is a sphere and then another</text><text start="2576.319" dur="3.28">one grabs the eyes and says this is a</text><text start="2578.16" dur="3.36">squid or something like that and they</text><text start="2579.599" dur="3.361">not all of them fail to grasp the entire</text><text start="2581.52" dur="3.2">elephant so you&apos;re saying there are</text><text start="2582.96" dur="3.6">different authors that have grasped</text><text start="2584.72" dur="3.28">different parts of what a nation means</text><text start="2586.56" dur="3.039">and uh</text><text start="2588.0" dur="3.52">but but yeah continue after that yeah</text><text start="2589.599" dur="4.321">and i offer obviously you know maybe i&apos;m</text><text start="2591.52" dur="4.64">just grabbing you know the horns or</text><text start="2593.92" dur="3.679">something like that the tusks but um but</text><text start="2596.16" dur="2.64">i but my definition is kind of</text><text start="2597.599" dur="3.441">interesting maybe interesting it&apos;s a</text><text start="2598.8" dur="3.2">computational definition that a nation</text><text start="2601.04" dur="2.72">is a</text><text start="2602.0" dur="3.359">densely connected subgraph in the social</text><text start="2603.76" dur="3.44">network</text><text start="2605.359" dur="4.24">or in a social network right why do i</text><text start="2607.2" dur="3.68">say that because a complete graph is one</text><text start="2609.599" dur="2.321">where every node is connected to every</text><text start="2610.88" dur="2.08">other node</text><text start="2611.92" dur="3.04">okay</text><text start="2612.96" dur="3.76">but a densely connected subgraph means</text><text start="2614.96" dur="3.84">that if you have a hundred nodes they</text><text start="2616.72" dur="4.399">don&apos;t have necessarily all 100 to choose</text><text start="2618.8" dur="3.6">two mutual you know connections and and</text><text start="2621.119" dur="2.641">that&apos;s a symmetric graph you could have</text><text start="2622.4" dur="3.439">asymmetrical graphs or things they&apos;re</text><text start="2623.76" dur="5.52">not necessarily all hundred choose two</text><text start="2625.839" dur="4.961">connections but they have way more</text><text start="2629.28" dur="3.36">internal connections than they do with a</text><text start="2630.8" dur="3.76">hundred random people</text><text start="2632.64" dur="3.92">it&apos;s a genuine community it&apos;s a densely</text><text start="2634.56" dur="3.519">interlinked community of people who like</text><text start="2636.56" dur="4.24">each other and work with each other and</text><text start="2638.079" dur="5.04">share the same values and so forth that</text><text start="2640.8" dur="4.64">starts to define what like a nation is</text><text start="2643.119" dur="4.401">not the lines on a map</text><text start="2645.44" dur="4.08">so this is similar to like the

dur="3.92">are doing collective things within a</text><text start="2706.4" dur="5.12">larger state and so on</text><text start="2708.56" dur="4.559">sure you could and and that&apos;s good okay</text><text start="2711.52" dur="3.2">and you know for many things it&apos;ll be</text><text start="2713.119" dur="2.561">fine to do that no one&apos;s gonna care if</text><text start="2714.72" dur="2.56">you are</text><text start="2715.68" dur="2.88">you know just</text><text start="2717.28" dur="3.039">cleaning up the neighborhood or</text><text start="2718.56" dur="3.279">something like

dur="5.84">i do think that nowadays anything that&apos;s</text><text start="2727.2" dur="4.72">beautiful in some way someone is going</text><text start="2729.76" dur="4.4">to attack it for for some

dur="2.959">so</text><text start="2737.76" dur="5.599">you just can&apos;t be like you know the</text><text start="2739.839" dur="5.441">naive farmers and not have any form of</text><text start="2743.359" dur="4.081">intellectual self-defense okay it&apos;s got</text><text start="2745.28" dur="3.28">your play the game civilization</text><text start="2747.44" dur="3.76">i have not</text><text start="2748.56" dur="4.64">okay so in civilization basically it&apos;s a</text><text start="2751.2" dur="3.6">you know it&apos;s this game where you</text><text start="2753.2" dur="4.159">you know you can start as</text><text start="2754.8" dur="3.84">the iroquois or the indians or</text><text start="2757.359" dur="2.081">you know the russians or whatever you</text><text start="2758.64" dur="2.479">know you can basically start as</text><text start="2759.44" dur="4.0">different civilizations and you build up</text><text start="2761.119" dur="4.641">right and</text><text start="2763.44" dur="5.04">the thing about civilization is there&apos;s</text><text start="2765.76" dur="5.04">guaranteed way to lose which is</text><text start="2768.48" dur="4.8">just in put everything into you know</text><text start="2770.8" dur="4.319">commerce and technology and</text><text start="2773.28" dur="4.0">not have any defense whatsoever and try</text><text start="2775.119" dur="3.921">to ascend the tech tree and what happens</text><text start="2777.28" dur="4.4">the guy next door who sends in like one</text><text start="2779.04" dur="4.559">spearman just takes all your stuff</text><text start="2781.68" dur="3.439">right that&apos;s what happens when you&apos;re at</text><text start="2783.599" dur="3.52">99</text><text start="2785.119" dur="4.24">you know 100 commerce in technology zero</text><text start="2787.119" dur="4.0">percent defense okay conversely if all</text><text start="2789.359" dur="4.321">you do is you crank out soldiers and</text><text start="2791.119" dur="3.921">stuff well you know it&apos;s saying uh you</text><text start="2793.68" dur="2.159">know you don&apos;t have a civ you may have</text><text start="2795.04" dur="2.559">defense but you don&apos;t have a</text><text start="2795.839" dur="3.841">civilization worth defending</text><text start="2797.599" dur="3.76">and so you just end up as this sort of</text><text start="2799.68" dur="3.679">primitive barbarian tribe that&apos;s</text><text start="2801.359" dur="4.48">attacking and you don&apos;t level up</text><text start="2803.359" dur="4.96">and so the right approach is a v3 that</text><text start="2805.839" dur="4.161">says okay i&apos;m going to allocate some</text><text start="2808.319" dur="5.201">to building</text><text start="2810.0" dur="6.24">and some to critiquing</text><text start="2813.52" dur="4.319">the critiquers of builders</text><text start="2816.24" dur="3.599">that&apos;s a digital version of it right</text><text start="2817.839" dur="3.76">because right most of society i think is</text><text start="2819.839" dur="3.841">over is invested in critiquing and</text><text start="2821.599" dur="4.081">tearing things down there&apos;s some group</text><text start="2823.68" dur="4.96">that says ignore all that and just build</text><text start="2825.68" dur="4.56">and i i vibe with the second group a lot</text><text start="2828.64" dur="3.04">but i also think some of them are naive</text><text start="2830.24" dur="3.76">because they&apos;ll build something great</text><text start="2831.68" dur="5.36">and guess what the critiquers are like</text><text start="2834.0" dur="4.56">armed robbers gangs who&apos;s the only thing</text><text start="2837.04" dur="3.6">is patrolling the internet and finding</text><text start="2838.56" dur="3.92">some way to try to bully you into</text><text start="2840.64" dur="4.08">handing it over to them right</text><text start="2842.48" dur="3.839">and go ahead as you can see it reminds</text><text start="2844.72" dur="3.119">me of um if you ever hear vitalik talk</text><text start="2846.319" dur="3.52">about proof of stake he talks about in</text><text start="2847.839" dur="3.52">order to design a economic network that</text><text start="2849.839" dur="3.681">is secure you have to make it a thousand</text><text start="2851.359" dur="4.081">times cheaper to defend than it is to</text><text start="2853.52" dur="3.36">attack and what this does over time is</text><text start="2855.44" dur="3.28">like with proof-of-stake ethereum it</text><text start="2856.88" dur="3.439">hardens it so that basically any</text><text start="2858.72" dur="3.839">attacker is going to have to expend way</text><text start="2860.319" dur="4.24">way way more resources in order to tear</text><text start="2862.559" dur="4.481">down what you&apos;re building and therefore</text><text start="2864.559" dur="4.641">it deters uh yes from doing that so it</text><text start="2867.04" dur="3.76">creates anti-fragility at the base layer</text><text start="2869.2" dur="3.44">that&apos;s right and there&apos;s different ways</text><text start="2870.8" dur="3.519">of doing defense pseudonymity is a form</text><text start="2872.64" dur="4.4">of defense where so long as you may</text><text start="2874.319" dur="5.28">opsec remain uh maintain opsec which is</text><text start="2877.04" dur="4.16">hard okay but yeah that&apos;s kind of a form</text><text start="2879.599" dur="3.76">of sort of passive self-defense right</text><text start="2881.2" dur="3.639">it&apos;s not the self-defense of a gun it is</text><text start="2883.359" dur="4.161">actually in a sense security through</text><text start="2884.839" dur="4.201">obscurity um you people don&apos;t have 33</text><text start="2887.52" dur="5.039">bits on you you know what 33 bits is</text><text start="2889.04" dur="4.96">it&apos;s uh arvid and orion&apos;s concept of um</text><text start="2892.559" dur="4.401">two to the 33rd</text><text start="2894.0" dur="4.48">is uh like eight billion and so that&apos;s</text><text start="2896.96" dur="3.76">seven something billion people in the</text><text start="2898.48" dur="3.28">world with 33 bits of independent</text><text start="2900.72" dur="2.48">information on somebody you could</text><text start="2901.76" dur="3.04">de-anonymize them</text><text start="2903.2" dur="3.119">and so the degree of pseudonymity you</text><text start="2904.8" dur="3.519">have can be thought of as being on a</text><text start="2906.319" dur="3.441">continuum like you have 10 bits of</text><text start="2908.319" dur="3.601">anonymity you&apos;re part of a set a</text><text start="2909.76" dur="3.359">pseudonymity set of 1000 people if you</text><text start="2911.92" dur="3.36">have 20 bits you&apos;re part of a million</text><text start="2913.119" dur="4.72">people right so you put enemies into me</text><text start="2915.28" dur="4.16">on a continuum and certain actions like</text><text start="2917.839" dur="3.041">showing a particular crypto credential</text><text start="2919.44" dur="2.96">it shows now that you&apos;re part of a</text><text start="2920.88" dur="3.28">million person group</text><text start="2922.4" dur="4.4">right but it doesn&apos;t fully de-anonymize</text><text start="2924.16" dur="4.32">you and uh you know so</text><text start="2926.8" dur="3.92">that may be a sufficient you know that</text><text start="2928.48" dur="4.879">may be an acceptable cost</text><text start="2930.72" dur="4.399">of a decrement in pseudonymity of</text><text start="2933.359" dur="3.921">reduction in opsec</text><text start="2935.119" dur="4.48">to achieve whatever goal you want so</text><text start="2937.28" dur="6.88">basically like pseudonymity is is a way</text><text start="2939.599" dur="6.0">to be defensive and anti-fragile um</text><text start="2944.16" dur="2.72">you know i guess you know are there</text><text start="2945.599" dur="3.76">other ways that we can create more</text><text start="2946.88" dur="4.64">coordination and and and be able to</text><text start="2949.359" dur="4.96">build these digital public goods and and</text><text start="2951.52" dur="3.839">not do it in a naive way like</text><text start="2954.319" dur="2.561">how do we how do we create more</text><text start="2955.359" dur="3.2">coordination and not have it be the</text><text start="2956.88" dur="3.52">naive variety we&apos;re all just kind of</text><text start="2958.559" dur="4.321">like pie in the sky building these</text><text start="2960.4" dur="4.32">non-defensible systems well i think</text><text start="2962.88" dur="3.679">you know you should you should basically</text><text start="2964.72" dur="3.04">well first of all having a moral one</text><text start="2966.559" dur="2.881">commandment</text><text start="2967.76" dur="3.2">is important because</text><text start="2969.44" dur="3.44">that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="2970.96" dur="3.2">yeah it&apos;s dual purpose actually right if</text><text start="2972.88" dur="3.28">you really believe that something you&apos;re</text><text start="2974.16" dur="4.959">doing is good and you&apos;ve got</text><text start="2976.16" dur="5.52">um you know hundreds of citations and</text><text start="2979.119" dur="4.561">videos and films and you can show the</text><text start="2981.68" dur="4.8">deficiencies of society at large and so</text><text start="2983.68" dur="5.2">and so forth you have an argument for</text><text start="2986.48" dur="3.76">your right to exist</text><text start="2988.88" dur="3.439">and somebody who&apos;s coming at you and</text><text start="2990.24" dur="4.24">trying to delegitimize you</text><text start="2992.319" dur="3.76">well they will have to</text><text start="2994.48" dur="4.24">punch their way through all those</text><text start="2996.079" dur="4.48">citations and argue because</text><text start="2998.72" dur="4.0">everybody in your community is equipped</text><text start="3000.559" dur="4.56">with that initial set of shields of</text><text start="3002.72" dur="4.8">citations that knock them down and the</text><text start="3005.119" dur="4.081">initial at least the uh it might be by</text><text start="3007.52" dur="3.2">the way it might be the case</text><text start="3009.2" dur="2.96">that even despite that you&apos;ve gotten</text><text start="3010.72" dur="3.119">something wrong and your community</text><text start="3012.16" dur="3.199">fizzles out and it doesn&apos;t test</text><text start="3013.839" dur="2.401">empirically and so on and so forth that</text><text start="3015.359" dur="2.72">actually happened in many of the</text><text start="3016.24" dur="2.96">american communes they just their moral</text><text start="3018.079" dur="2.0">innovation didn&apos;t work just like many</text><text start="3019.2" dur="3.6">startups</text><text start="3020.079" dur="4.081">start companies don&apos;t work right but</text><text start="3022.8" dur="3.12">the one commandment gives that</text><text start="3024.16" dur="4.48">self-defense because now if somebody</text><text start="3025.92" dur="5.76">wants to critique at least you know the</text><text start="3028.64" dur="5.52">lazy v1 obvious</text><text start="3031.68" dur="4.159">you know kind of attacks</text><text start="3034.16" dur="3.199">you know that that falls on deaf ears</text><text start="3035.839" dur="3.76">and frankly</text><text

day who&apos;s like oh oh my god i</text><text start="3049.44" dur="3.84">can&apos;t believe you made all this money</text><text start="3051.52" dur="4.079">and you&apos;re unpatriotic and you&apos;re now</text><text start="3053.28" dur="4.0">exiting oh you trade or blah blah and</text><text start="3055.599" dur="4.72">it&apos;s like wait a second</text><text start="3057.28" dur="4.48">um you know this is like uh</text><text start="3060.319" dur="3.441">this is</text><text start="3061.76" dur="4.88">the kind of person who wanted</text><text start="3063.76" dur="5.44">h1bs to come to the

dur="2.799">it does mean that you can&apos;t have like</text><text start="3173.359" dur="3.441">this you know sir prison status the</text><text start="3174.559" dur="4.641">point is that&apos;s an example of somebody</text><text start="3176.8" dur="5.92">who&apos;s just got a lazy attack that you</text><text start="3179.2" dur="4.56">know just easily kind of batted away</text><text start="3182.72" dur="2.96">because they really haven&apos;t thought</text><text start="3183.76" dur="2.96">through the morality of it at all you</text><text start="3185.68" dur="2.96">know</text><text start="3186.72" dur="4.399">and so thinking through the morality of</text><text start="3188.64" dur="4.56">it is uh it&apos;s basically like programming</text><text start="3191.119" dur="4.081">the software of people&apos;s heads having a</text><text start="3193.2" dur="3.76">really clear sense of why they&apos;re doing</text><text start="3195.2" dur="3.6">what they&apos;re doing and the ability for</text><text start="3196.96" dur="3.2">them to defend that on their own or in</text><text start="3198.8" dur="3.2">groups</text><text start="3200.16" dur="3.28">and frankly to interrogate it because</text><text start="3202.0" dur="3.44">you know what it might be inconsistent</text><text start="3203.44" dur="3.52">you know this premise might not add up</text><text start="3205.44" dur="3.119">and so that ethical</text><text start="3206.96" dur="3.76">thinking is i think really</text><text start="3208.559" dur="4.0">underappreciated because when you have</text><text start="3210.72" dur="3.44">true clarity of purpose and when people</text><text start="3212.559" dur="2.8">really really really really believe in</text><text start="3214.16" dur="2.88">what they&apos;re doing</text><text start="3215.359" dur="2.641">that&apos;s when you build great things in my</text><text start="3217.04" dur="2.72">view</text><text start="3218.0" dur="2.72">it&apos;s just so interesting</text><text start="3219.76" dur="2.64">that</text><text start="3220.72" dur="2.96">well first off with the right to exit i</text><text start="3222.4" dur="2.88">was talking to someone as i was doing my</text><text start="3223.68" dur="4.0">research for this podcast and one</text><text start="3225.28" dur="3.76">interesting sort of observation biology</text><text start="3227.68" dur="5.36">was that network states are going to</text><text start="3229.04" dur="6.319">allow refugees to resettle in new places</text><text start="3233.04" dur="4.559">more easily so say you&apos;re in syria</text><text start="3235.359" dur="3.601">you&apos;re in the ukraine and you have to go</text><text start="3237.599" dur="2.801">west because of some sort of physical</text><text start="3238.96" dur="4.56">war you&apos;re gonna be able to reset</text><text start="3240.4" dur="4.64">resettle in your new place uh yes easier</text><text start="3243.52" dur="3.44">because you&apos;re bringing your assets with</text><text start="3245.04" dur="3.76">you but also your your your connections</text><text start="3246.96" dur="3.359">from the network state into into that</text><text start="3248.8" dur="3.68">nation so so it creates more of a right</text><text start="3250.319" dur="4.561">to exit in the physical world you can</text><text start="3252.48" dur="4.639">actually have this pretty interesting</text><text start="3254.88" dur="3.52">thing there like digital government</text><text start="3257.119" dur="3.921">jump at this</text><text start="3258.4" dur="7.28">did this thing where um</text><text start="3261.04" dur="7.279">the uh it&apos;s called diia okay and it it&apos;s</text><text start="3265.68" dur="5.04">made it much easier for those refugees</text><text start="3268.319" dur="4.641">to integrate into like the uk and other</text><text start="3270.72" dur="5.359">places they actually just had that in</text><text start="3272.96" dur="6.0">the end of 2021 and like this site says</text><text start="3276.079" dur="5.681">13 million out of 44 million inhabitants</text><text start="3278.96" dur="4.08">and so because of that they&apos;re able to</text><text start="3281.76" dur="2.799">you know sometimes have to flee with</text><text start="3283.04" dur="3.44">just you know possessions on their back</text><text start="3284.559" dur="3.361">but they had their phone and guess what</text><text start="3286.48" dur="2.48">they could prove who they were because</text><text start="3287.92" dur="2.48">you know most of the time when people</text><text start="3288.96" dur="2.8">are fleeing they don&apos;t have their papers</text><text start="3290.4" dur="3.84">and so on they&apos;re you know stateless</text><text start="3291.76" dur="4.4">persons but this allowed them to sort of</text><text start="3294.24" dur="4.8">integrate into new society get new</text><text start="3296.16" dur="5.12">identity documents and and whatnot right</text><text start="3299.04" dur="4.4">so diia i think is pretty pretty</text><text start="3301.28" dur="4.24">important and a piece of the future</text><text start="3303.44" dur="3.52">and um</text><text start="3305.52" dur="3.12">uh you know i just wanted to flag that</text><text start="3306.96" dur="3.28">you know for uh
