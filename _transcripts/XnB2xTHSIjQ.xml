all</text><text start="36.239" dur="4.64">the governance discussions this is just</text><text start="37.84" dur="5.2">a tiny sample of why bitcoin dial was</text><text start="40.879" dur="4.241">launched git coin dao governs get coin</text><text start="43.04" dur="4.32">grants which is a funding mechanism for</text><text start="45.12" dur="3.84">the ethereum community bitcoin dow&apos;s</text><text start="47.36" dur="3.519">mission is to build and fund digital</text><text start="48.96" dur="4.32">public goods it does that mostly with</text><text start="50.879" dur="3.68">quadratic funding and get coin grants if</text><text start="53.28" dur="3.2">you know anything about quadratic</text><text start="54.559" dur="5.121">funding you know that it&apos;s the optimal</text><text start="56.48" dur="5.28">way to fund a democratic community of</text><text start="59.68" dur="4.4">public goods and it&apos;s because</text><text start="61.76" dur="4.16">the every quarter on get coin bitcoin</text><text start="64.08" dur="4.0">grants runs a matching campaign that</text><text start="65.92" dur="3.84">matches contributions from the crowd</text><text start="68.08" dur="4.24">usually about five million dollars are</text><text start="69.76" dur="4.08">given out every quarter and one of the</text><text start="72.32" dur="3.36">really powerful things about quadratic</text><text start="73.84" dur="3.599">funding is that the matching comes from</text><text start="75.68" dur="3.52">the number of contributions to each</text><text start="77.439" dur="4.0">grant on git coin so you&apos;re basically</text><text start="79.2" dur="4.0">getting rewarded for what your peers</text><text start="81.439" dur="4.241">think of your project on git coin grants</text><text start="83.2" dur="4.0">and that&apos;s really powerful because a one</text><text start="85.68" dur="3.84">dollar contribution can be hundreds</text><text start="87.2" dur="4.16">sometimes thousands of dollars of</text><text start="89.52" dur="4.0">matching on git coin grants and that&apos;s</text><text start="91.36" dur="3.92">powerful but it&apos;s also presenting</text><text start="93.52" dur="3.279">presenting some governance problems what</text><text start="95.28" dur="4.159">do we do about civil attacks people who</text><text start="96.799" dur="4.241">make up new identities in order to</text><text start="99.439" dur="3.121">get funds out of the matching pool how</text><text start="101.04" dur="3.2">do we even allocate funds to the</text><text start="102.56" dur="3.12">matching pool in the first place these</text><text start="104.24" dur="3.12">are the governance problems that get</text><text start="105.68" dur="5.28">coin

dur="3.199">dao and the evolution of its governance</text><text start="302.639" dur="4.641">it&apos;s been about a year since get</text><text start="303.759" dur="6.401">coindale launched in may of 2021. kyle</text><text start="307.28" dur="7.6">can you tell us about the why and the</text><text start="310.16" dur="7.12">how of the dow launch on may 25th 2021</text><text start="314.88" dur="4.319">yeah for sure um thanks for having us i</text><text start="317.28" dur="4.4">think we&apos;re excited to kind of tell a</text><text start="319.199" dur="5.681">little bit more about bitcoin and</text><text start="321.68" dur="4.72">how we got to where we are today so back</text><text start="324.88" dur="3.2">a year ago</text><text start="326.4" dur="3.68">i think we were really interested in</text><text start="328.08" dur="4.32">solving some of the governance problems</text><text start="330.08" dur="4.08">that bitcoin had around our grants</text><text start="332.4" dur="3.12">program and sort of funding allocation</text><text start="334.16" dur="3.52">specifically</text><text start="335.52" dur="4.239">at the time we were a team that was</text><text start="337.68" dur="3.76">trying to figure out you know how much</text><text start="339.759" dur="3.44">money to appropriate to each of the</text><text start="341.44" dur="3.759">different categories of grants that were</text><text start="343.199" dur="4.161">on bitcoin and we recognized there&apos;s</text><text start="345.199" dur="4.081">this really large opportunity to move</text><text start="347.36" dur="4.399">not only the the platform the entire</text><text start="349.28" dur="4.4">grants platform over to the community</text><text start="351.759" dur="4.16">into the dao and what we aspired to be a</text><text start="353.68" dur="5.28">dao at the time but also the decision</text><text start="355.919" dur="4.881">making for how to allocate that funding</text><text start="358.96" dur="4.0">um and to turn more and more of that</text><text start="360.8" dur="4.64">control over to the community instead of</text><text start="362.96" dur="4.64">you know the team that you and i were on</text><text start="365.44" dur="4.96">as we kind of built and advanced that</text><text start="367.6" dur="5.68">product so with the launch of the gtc</text><text start="370.4" dur="5.519">and the token um we set out to</text><text start="373.28" dur="4.16">decentralize a lot of the governance and</text><text start="375.919" dur="3.761">decision making on the grants round</text><text start="377.44" dur="4.64">specifically and also see if we could</text><text start="379.68" dur="4.72">spin up different work streams um and</text><text start="382.08" dur="4.399">empower people to help kind of grow and</text><text start="384.4" dur="3.2">further and advance bitcoin&apos;s mission</text><text start="386.479" dur="2.401">beyond just</text><text start="387.6" dur="2.48">you know the core team that we had at</text><text start="388.88" dur="3.68">the time</text><text start="390.08" dur="4.16">right and so can you say more about the</text><text start="392.56" dur="4.32">governance process that was launched i</text><text start="394.24" dur="4.48">know that there was a proof of uh an</text><text start="396.88" dur="5.039">airdrop with a proof of knowledge and</text><text start="398.72" dur="6.24">then a proof of distribution uh how did</text><text start="401.919" dur="4.961">that that airdrop set up the conditions</text><text start="404.96" dur="3.84">for get coin dao at the start and what</text><text start="406.88" dur="3.599">did governance look like at the start</text><text start="408.8" dur="4.56">yeah great question</text><text start="410.479" dur="4.961">so um whenever we first launched one of</text><text start="413.36" dur="4.72">the things that we recognized is we</text><text start="415.44" dur="4.08">identified the governance participation</text><text start="418.08" dur="3.6">was really low</text><text start="419.52" dur="3.92">and at the time we were trying to come</text><text start="421.68" dur="3.28">up with ideas as to how to encourage</text><text start="423.44" dur="3.759">more participation and how to make sure</text><text start="424.96" dur="5.12">that these governance tokens which were</text><text start="427.199" dur="5.681">were used to govern a thing and you know</text><text start="430.08" dur="5.2">hopefully not to speculate on a thing um</text><text start="432.88" dur="4.4">were actually used in that way and one</text><text start="435.28" dur="4.8">of the things that bitcoin did is um you</text><text start="437.28" dur="5.68">mentioned yes we had our airdrop where</text><text start="440.08" dur="5.04">half of the total supply of the tokens</text><text start="442.96" dur="4.32">went to those who helped us build and</text><text start="445.12" dur="3.68">advance our mission to date and the</text><text start="447.28" dur="3.52">other half were kind of set aside in the</text><text start="448.8" dur="3.92">treasury to help</text><text start="450.8" dur="4.0">further our mission in the future we&apos;ll</text><text start="452.72" dur="4.479">talk about that half in just a sec</text><text start="454.8" dur="4.08">but as part of the delegation or excuse</text><text start="457.199" dur="4.0">me the airdrop experience we introduced</text><text start="458.88" dur="4.719">delegation where for those who were</text><text start="461.199" dur="4.801">coming in to claim their airdrop they</text><text start="463.599" dur="4.641">either needed to self-delegate as part</text><text start="466.0" dur="4.56">of that claim or they needed to pick a</text><text start="468.24" dur="5.519">steward and stewards were somewhat new</text><text start="470.56" dur="5.44">at the time um they&apos;re a bit more common</text><text start="473.759" dur="3.28">now we&apos;re incredibly thankful that ens</text><text start="476.0" dur="2.56">and</text><text start="477.039" dur="3.121">optimism and others have started to pick</text><text start="478.56" dur="2.96">up kind of that steward approach and the</text><text start="480.16" dur="2.719">delegate approach</text><text start="481.52" dur="3.04">but at the time</text><text start="482.879" dur="3.6">claiming your tokens and actually</text><text start="484.56" dur="4.479">delegating to someone as part of that</text><text start="486.479" dur="5.681">that same kind of one-two click of the</text><text start="489.039" dur="4.641">experience um was novel and i think it&apos;s</text><text start="492.16" dur="2.96">one of the things that really helped us</text><text start="493.68" dur="3.6">both identify</text><text start="495.12" dur="4.479">who great stewards of our community</text><text start="497.28" dur="3.68">would be that&apos;s what brought simona into</text><text start="499.599" dur="2.72">our world that&apos;s what brought linda into</text><text start="500.96" dur="3.28">our world that&apos;s what brought chris into</text><text start="502.319" dur="4.241">our world is them showing up as</text><text start="504.24" dur="4.079">stewards and delegates here um but then</text><text start="506.56" dur="2.88">also enabled our community to help make</text><text start="508.319" dur="4.4">sure that their voice was being</text><text start="509.44" dur="4.32">represented as part of their airdrop so</text><text start="512.719" dur="4.32">um</text><text start="513.76" dur="5.36">tldr airdrop launched um it had a great</text><text start="517.039" dur="3.601">experience like we invited people to the</text><text start="519.12" dur="2.64">quadratic lands with us they were able</text><text start="520.64" dur="3.199">to claim their tokens they could</text><text start="521.76" dur="4.32">delegate to a steward and then we worked</text><text start="523.839" dur="4.721">with those stewards um to make sure that</text><text start="526.08" dur="4.24">we had a governance process kind of laid</text><text start="528.56" dur="3.68">out and set up and that we had</text><text start="530.32" dur="4.4">initiatives or work streams set up that</text><text start="532.24" dur="4.8">we felt like would be great places to</text><text start="534.72" dur="3.679">seed a lot of the growth of the dao and</text><text start="537.04" dur="3.28">from that it&apos;s kind of been off to the</text><text start="538.399" dur="3.521">races with our stewards helping lead and</text><text start="540.32" dur="2.56">guide much of what the dow does from now</text><text start="541.92" dur="2.72">on</text><text start="542.88" dur="4.16">right and just for the listeners out</text><text start="544.64" dur="5.6">there uh stewards is what git coin dao</text><text start="547.04" dur="4.88">calls delegates um and then work streams</text><text start="550.24" dur="4.8">are kind of the fundamental</text><text start="551.92" dur="4.96">organized organizational unit of the dow</text><text start="555.04" dur="3.84">and how

out</text><text start="577.04" dur="5.68">that lore uh over time uh linda i want</text><text start="579.6" dur="4.88">to kick it to you next you have are a</text><text start="582.72" dur="3.52">coin investor you&apos;ve been a get coined</text><text start="584.48" dur="4.16">out steward and you were there from the</text><text start="586.24" dur="4.96">start uh curious if you have anything to</text><text start="588.64" dur="5.84">add about the dow launch back in may of</text><text start="591.2" dur="5.6">2021 yeah um i was really impressed with</text><text start="594.48" dur="4.0">how the launch went i thought it was um</text><text start="596.8" dur="3.92">really well thought through</text><text start="598.48" dur="3.84">one of the problems in the past of dao&apos;s</text><text start="600.72" dur="4.48">is that there wasn&apos;t much voter</text><text start="602.32" dur="4.4">participation and so i love that at</text><text start="605.2" dur="3.84">launch there was a hundred percent</text><text start="606.72" dur="4.48">delegation when you had to claim airdrop</text><text start="609.04" dur="4.88">which i think was a first from what i</text><text start="611.2" dur="5.36">saw or at least it was very early on and</text><text start="613.92" dur="6.32">um i also loved that because the airdrop</text><text start="616.56" dur="5.44">went to past users who had</text><text start="620.24" dur="3.839">supported and contributed to public</text><text start="622.0" dur="3.2">goods you already bootstrapped a very</text><text start="624.079" dur="3.361">strong</text><text start="625.2" dur="4.16">community that just had really really</text><text start="627.44" dur="4.639">good values and i felt like the</text><text start="629.36" dur="4.08">community was just almost filtered early</text><text start="632.079" dur="2.641">on for people that cared about the</text><text start="633.44" dur="3.12">long-term</text><text start="634.72" dur="4.16">funding of public goods and so it was</text><text start="636.56" dur="3.92">just um for me like a really thoughtful</text><text start="638.88" dur="3.6">launch and</text><text start="640.48" dur="3.68">i see a lot of future dollars</text><text start="642.48" dur="3.599">replicating it but</text><text start="644.16" dur="3.84">you can just tell like early on that the</text><text start="646.079" dur="4.161">energy was really positive and the</text><text start="648.0" dur="4.72">delegates that came through um really</text><text start="650.24" dur="5.2">did care about the mission of the dow so</text><text start="652.72" dur="4.48">just want to say thanks for that launch</text><text start="655.44" dur="4.079">process</text><text start="657.2" dur="4.72">yeah and it was really uh</text><text start="659.519" dur="4.161">a lot of fun to have you linda become</text><text start="661.92" dur="3.919">involved in governance and reviewing</text><text start="663.68" dur="4.159">proposals um can you talk a little bit</text><text start="665.839" dur="3.601">about your experience as a steward over</text><text start="667.839" dur="3.361">the last year</text><text start="669.44" dur="4.88">yeah um it&apos;s definitely been a learning</text><text start="671.2" dur="5.12">process through the last year i think</text><text start="674.32" dur="4.4">early on there were a lot of decisions</text><text start="676.32" dur="4.8">to be made in the dow and over time we</text><text start="678.72" dur="4.32">kind of started having more of the work</text><text start="681.12" dur="3.92">towards the working groups and so we</text><text start="683.04" dur="3.919">spent more time improving budgets rather</text><text start="685.04" dur="4.72">than like smaller decisions within the</text><text start="686.959" dur="4.801">dow which um while it&apos;s not necessarily</text><text start="689.76" dur="3.92">my favorite part of like approving</text><text start="691.76" dur="3.36">budgets on a regular basis i do think</text><text start="693.68" dur="4.56">that it makes more sense from an</text><text start="695.12" dur="5.6">efficiency standpoint um but it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="698.24" dur="4.56">also been i think a learning process in</text><text start="700.72" dur="5.679">that we&apos;re starting to have more open</text><text start="702.8" dur="4.96">transparent conversations um where early</text><text start="706.399" dur="3.12">on like i would say that people are</text><text start="707.76" dur="2.639">pretty generous about approving things</text><text start="709.519" dur="2.481">and like</text><text start="710.399" dur="4.481">kind of um</text><text start="712.0" dur="4.48">just learning the process of the dao and</text><text start="714.88" dur="3.36">a lot of us like didn&apos;t even know each</text><text start="716.48" dur="3.599">other necessarily like there were a ton</text><text start="718.24" dur="3.92">of people brought together from the</text><text start="720.079" dur="3.44">stout like all over the world and we&apos;re</text><text start="722.16" dur="2.72">just starting to learn how to work with</text><text start="723.519" dur="3.281">each other and so</text><text start="724.88" dur="4.0">over time you start</text><text start="726.8" dur="4.479">being more open to having these tough</text><text start="728.88" dur="3.92">conversations around hey like</text><text start="731.279" dur="4.881">i don&apos;t necessarily think that this</text><text start="732.8" dur="5.839">amount requested for this budget is um</text><text start="736.16" dur="4.72">maybe the best use of funds um</text><text start="738.639" dur="4.401">especially relative to the dow treasury</text><text start="740.88" dur="3.519">this might not necessarily</text><text start="743.04" dur="3.12">be ideal so like let&apos;s have a</text><text start="744.399" dur="3.841">conversation around what&apos;s actually</text><text start="746.16" dur="3.44">needed here and like we kind of iterate</text><text start="748.24" dur="3.12">from there and so</text><text start="749.6" dur="4.32">that&apos;s only kind of in my opinion been</text><text start="751.36" dur="5.76">in a more recent situation like early on</text><text start="753.92" dur="5.039">there were just more generous approvals</text><text start="757.12" dur="2.8">and so i&apos;m really glad with how we&apos;re</text><text start="758.959" dur="3.361">just</text><text start="759.92" dur="4.64">i think growing up as a dao i would say</text><text start="762.32" dur="5.199">um and i think we&apos;re becoming more</text><text start="764.56" dur="5.2">sophisticated in metrics and</text><text start="767.519" dur="3.681">having compensation structures and just</text><text start="769.76" dur="4.0">kind of figuring things out and i think</text><text start="771.2" dur="4.079">simona and everyone here has just done a</text><text start="773.76" dur="3.68">really great job of pushing for these</text><text start="775.279" dur="4.161">conversations so it&apos;s</text><text start="777.44" dur="3.36">definitely over a year like yeah we&apos;ve</text><text start="779.44" dur="3.04">just grown up a lot</text><text start="780.8" dur="4.64">right we&apos;re gonna get into the scope of</text><text start="782.48" dur="4.479">the governance rights that gtc imbues uh</text><text start="785.44" dur="4.0">in the future but one of the main ones</text><text start="786.959" dur="4.56">as you said is approving budgets and i</text><text start="789.44" dur="4.0">know that that&apos;s been sort of up and</text><text start="791.519" dur="3.681">down as the market has kicked around and</text><text start="793.44" dur="3.6">as we figure out the essential intents</text><text start="795.2" dur="3.52">of the dow i think it&apos;s a good</text><text start="797.04" dur="4.16">opportunity to kick it over to simone</text><text start="798.72" dur="4.48">pop at this point who&apos;s doing uh dow</text><text start="801.2" dur="4.4">engagement strategy i get coined out now</text><text start="803.2" dur="4.72">but at first i think started off as one</text><text start="805.6" dur="4.239">of the top stewards in the dow so uh</text><text start="807.92" dur="3.919">simona tell us about your entrance into</text><text start="809.839" dur="4.24">get coindao and your impressions of how</text><text start="811.839" dur="4.0">governance works there in the past</text><text start="814.079" dur="2.56">present and future</text><text start="815.839" dur="4.8">so</text><text start="816.639" dur="5.281">um i i feel it was a natural</text><text start="820.639" dur="4.481">um</text><text start="821.92" dur="4.96">step in um</text><text start="825.12" dur="3.92">my kind of</text><text start="826.88" dur="5.759">work in web 3 to</text><text start="829.04" dur="6.4">become one of the top stewards um my uh</text><text start="832.639" dur="5.2">relationship with bitcoin has um</text><text start="835.44" dur="6.0">you know has been going for what is it</text><text start="837.839" dur="4.641">now four years so um we&apos;ve had a long</text><text start="841.44" dur="4.88">history</text><text start="842.48" dur="5.359">and i think uh it was only natural when</text><text start="846.32" dur="4.4">um the</text><text start="847.839" dur="4.481">the doubt started that i would become a</text><text start="850.72" dur="4.0">steward and apply to become a steward</text><text start="852.32" dur="5.36">and then become a steward and a lot of</text><text start="854.72" dur="5.359">people um felt that they could trust me</text><text start="857.68" dur="4.32">and delegated uh their tokens to me that</text><text start="860.079" dur="4.161">i appreciate um</text><text start="862.0" dur="5.279">every day and uh hopefully i&apos;m making</text><text start="864.24" dur="6.48">the right decisions on their behalf um</text><text start="867.279" dur="6.081">i think in terms of the</text><text start="870.72" dur="4.32">a little bit to to what linda said the</text><text start="873.36" dur="4.08">evolution of</text><text start="875.04" dur="4.799">what governance looks like particularly</text><text start="877.44" dur="3.6">because get going down was so early</text><text start="879.839" dur="4.081">amongst</text><text start="881.04" dur="5.359">the dows to play around with a lot of</text><text start="883.92" dur="5.2">the delegation a lot of the stewardship</text><text start="886.399" dur="3.921">a lot of the flows that really didn&apos;t</text><text start="889.12" dur="2.32">and don&apos;t</text><text start="890.32" dur="4.879">exist</text><text start="891.44" dur="5.399">um for us to uh to utilize or to shape</text><text start="895.199" dur="5.601">or to</text><text start="896.839" dur="6.68">indeed purpose or or uh adopt for the</text><text start="900.8" dur="3.92">uses of this now you have to create them</text><text start="903.519" dur="2.081">from scratch</text><text start="904.72" dur="2.88">and</text><text start="905.6" dur="4.72">creating them from scratch is something</text><text start="907.6" dur="4.799">that as i always say needs to come from</text><text start="910.32" dur="4.319">a very very mindful place where you are</text><text start="912.399" dur="4.641">constantly in this</text><text start="914.639" dur="5.921">um dynamic of</text><text start="917.04" dur="6.08">balance between attention and action and</text><text start="920.56" dur="5.44">the attention part coming back to what</text><text start="923.12" dur="5.92">both kyle and linda mentioned is very</text><text start="926.0" dur="6.16">very difficult in this space we are</text><text start="929.04" dur="6.08">incredibly incredibly uh</text><text start="932.16" dur="6.479">tight on attention um there is so so</text><text start="935.12" dur="5.68">much to focus on particularly for people</text><text start="938.639" dur="5.44">who have been in this this ecosystem for</text><text start="940.8" dur="5.68">a while um we have a lot a lot of</text><text start="944.079" dur="4.56">interests um around the ecosystem</text><text start="946.48" dur="5.12">because we all want to see it grow and</text><text start="948.639" dur="5.041">evolve because the tide lifts all ships</text><text start="951.6" dur="4.479">and i think it&apos;s important that you know</text><text start="953.68" dur="4.719">we keep that in our minds as we evolve</text><text start="956.079" dur="4.481">things but that balance between</text><text start="958.399" dur="6.161">attention and action is something that</text><text start="960.56" dur="5.04">in practice is actually pretty difficult</text><text start="964.56" dur="4.24">to</text><text start="965.6" dur="5.599">like really get right um and having</text><text start="968.8" dur="3.92">people participate and participate in a</text><text start="971.199" dur="3.281">meaningful way</text><text start="972.72" dur="6.64">is something that</text><text start="974.48" dur="8.24">needs to be addressed and um</text><text start="979.36" dur="7.2">coast and and kind of um</text><text start="982.72" dur="6.72">enabled by very very um clear flows</text><text start="986.56" dur="5.199">which is again what linda was saying i</text><text start="989.44" dur="4.88">feel we&apos;ve been starting to implement a</text><text start="991.759" dur="5.281">lot since like in the last</text><text start="994.32" dur="5.12">um let&apos;s say six months um and i think</text><text start="997.04" dur="4.96">we&apos;ve really really seen that</text><text start="999.44" dur="4.48">come through in the granularity of the</text><text start="1002.0" dur="3.759">decisions in the</text><text start="1003.92" dur="3.52">uh attention to detail in the</text><text start="1005.759" dur="4.561">conversations that we&apos;ve been having</text><text start="1007.44" dur="5.92">which have been one of my favorite uh</text><text start="1010.32" dur="5.68">parts of this whole process just the</text><text start="1013.36" dur="3.52">care that goes into those conversations</text><text start="1016.0" dur="4.16">and</text><text start="1016.88" dur="4.8">potentially those debates where or</text><text start="1020.16" dur="4.399">i won&apos;t call them arguments because they</text><text start="1021.68" dur="4.159">are just debates around what is valuable</text><text start="1024.559" dur="4.801">what should</text><text start="1025.839" dur="6.72">be something that we do now versus a</text><text start="1029.36" dur="6.0">little bit further down the line and</text><text start="1032.559" dur="4.801">making sure that again we we balance all</text><text start="1035.36" dur="4.559">of those things out in</text><text start="1037.36" dur="5.92">an engaged and meaningful way and</text><text start="1039.919" dur="6.321">potentially creating standards that can</text><text start="1043.28" dur="7.2">help the the entire now ecosystem move</text><text start="1046.24" dur="7.2">forward is something that is um i feel a</text><text start="1050.48" dur="5.12">great responsibility for um and i feel</text><text start="1053.44" dur="4.8">is is very important for us to to</text><text start="1055.6" dur="4.079">continue evolving right absolutely uh</text><text start="1058.24" dur="4.48">chris would love to kick it over to you</text><text start="1059.679" dur="5.521">and uh hear hear about your experience</text><text start="1062.72" dur="3.68">working on get coindao over the last six</text><text start="1065.2" dur="3.44">to nine months</text><text start="1066.4" dur="3.84">yeah it&apos;s been an interesting experience</text><text start="1068.64" dur="3.919">so i um</text><text start="1070.24" dur="6.16">i joined the dao like at the very</text><text start="1072.559" dur="5.521">beginning um as a steward um and</text><text start="1076.4" dur="4.88">the dao actually started on my birth</text><text start="1078.08" dur="5.36">today so i&apos;m never gonna forget that</text><text start="1081.28" dur="5.759">so that&apos;s that was like an epic moment</text><text start="1083.44" dur="4.96">it was like oh i&apos;m getting tokens</text><text start="1087.039" dur="3.681">happy birthday</text><text start="1088.4" dur="5.04">yeah so it was like it was a great start</text><text start="1090.72" dur="4.88">to to see that getcoin went</text><text start="1093.44" dur="4.72">to the next level with starting the dow</text><text start="1095.6" dur="5.199">so i i was very much into this</text><text start="1098.16" dur="5.44">and then uh yeah very soon i uh joined</text><text start="1100.799" dur="5.281">as a contributor um working initially on</text><text start="1103.6" dur="4.88">community experience it was still</text><text start="1106.08" dur="6.0">being like we were still discovering</text><text start="1108.48" dur="4.8">what that exactly entailed um and i was</text><text start="1112.08" dur="2.959">i was</text><text start="1113.28" dur="4.0">yeah still discovering like how how i</text><text start="1115.039" dur="3.201">could add value and so the thing that</text><text start="1117.28" dur="3.2">came</text><text start="1118.24" dur="5.2">came about very quickly was like okay we</text><text start="1120.48" dur="3.84">need a body between somewhere between</text><text start="1123.44" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="1124.32" dur="3.76">on the one hand the stewards where we</text><text start="1126.32" dur="3.68">can make decisions about like okay we</text><text start="1128.08" dur="4.08">have budgets that we have for these work</text><text start="1130.0" dur="4.799">streams these these units these</text><text start="1132.16" dur="4.399">organizational units</text><text start="1134.799" dur="2.721">and then just the contributors who are</text><text start="1136.559" dur="2.881">just like</text><text start="1137.52" dur="3.92">coming coming with initiatives we need</text><text start="1139.44" dur="3.68">another uh body where we bring the</text><text start="1141.44" dur="4.88">different work streams together and make</text><text start="1143.12" dur="6.08">decisions so that became what is now um</text><text start="1146.32" dur="6.239">which is a mouthful so csdo so this is</text><text start="1149.2" dur="4.8">the cross stream dao operations call so</text><text start="1152.559" dur="4.48">we have a</text><text start="1154.0" dur="4.88">a very tactical call once a week and</text><text start="1157.039" dur="4.321">every two weeks we have a strategic call</text><text start="1158.88" dur="5.52">where we dive deeper and so in these two</text><text start="1161.36" dur="4.64">calls we make decisions as as a team so</text><text start="1164.4" dur="4.32">like in these calls there&apos;s two</text><text start="1166.0" dur="4.4">representatives per workstream most of</text><text start="1168.72" dur="3.28">the time it&apos;s like the work stream lead</text><text start="1170.4" dur="3.2">or the workshop leads</text><text start="1172.0" dur="4.88">and and there we</text><text start="1173.6" dur="5.6">ratify a number of things that we do not</text><text start="1176.88" dur="4.4">want to like bring to the stewards or we</text><text start="1179.2" dur="4.24">communicate it to the stewards but we we</text><text start="1181.28" dur="5.12">have decisions to make on a daily basis</text><text start="1183.44" dur="4.239">and so we bring these um on this level</text><text start="1186.4" dur="4.08">and then we communicate it to the</text><text start="1187.679" dur="6.961">stewards so that&apos;s what we do in cseo</text><text start="1190.48" dur="6.079">and that evolved uh quite a bit so um</text><text start="1194.64" dur="4.48">personally it was just a meeting but</text><text start="1196.559" dur="4.401">then very soon there was this entire</text><text start="1199.12" dur="3.439">work stream that developed around it and</text><text start="1200.96" dur="3.839">that is</text><text start="1202.559" dur="4.401">dao operations so because there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="1204.799" dur="3.841">of things that you can actually unify</text><text start="1206.96" dur="4.4">and that all the work streams need so</text><text start="1208.64" dur="5.36">that&apos;s like how do we how do we tackle</text><text start="1211.36" dur="4.08">things like accounting uh people</text><text start="1214.0" dur="3.84">operations</text><text start="1215.44" dur="4.96">um lots of things that that we see that</text><text start="1217.84" dur="5.28">this is impacts cross down so this</text><text start="1220.4" dur="6.32">became a work stream and so this</text><text start="1223.12" dur="5.12">tactical meeting the cso call became</text><text start="1226.72" dur="3.12">something that was really very much at</text><text start="1228.24" dur="3.2">the heart of it</text><text start="1229.84" dur="3.92">and then yeah it was really interesting</text><text start="1231.44" dur="3.28">to to experiment with this and see like</text><text start="1233.76" dur="4.08">how</text><text start="1234.72" dur="5.52">how can you actually take decisions</text><text start="1237.84" dur="6.8">as a team where nobody is the boss like</text><text start="1240.24" dur="6.4">before it was easy it was um there is uh</text><text start="1244.64" dur="5.039">there&apos;s just get going holdings and</text><text start="1246.64" dur="5.76">there is kevin owaki who is the ceo and</text><text start="1249.679" dur="4.961">there is a ceo kyle and then</text><text start="1252.4" dur="4.48">it was always a very collaborative</text><text start="1254.64" dur="3.84">environment it feels to me but now</text><text start="1256.88" dur="3.44">suddenly it&apos;s like okay nobody is in</text><text start="1258.48" dur="3.84">charge we all are</text><text start="1260.32" dur="4.239">so we experimented with different ways</text><text start="1262.32" dur="5.599">of doing this so um</text><text start="1264.559" dur="6.24">what um the first format of of of the</text><text start="1267.919" dur="5.201">call was uh using integrative decision</text><text start="1270.799" dur="5.281">making so that&apos;s like the holocratic way</text><text start="1273.12" dur="5.679">where like you have a process of asking</text><text start="1276.08" dur="5.76">um for making a proposal and then you go</text><text start="1278.799" dur="3.921">through a round of getting uh reactions</text><text start="1281.84" dur="2.48">and then</text><text start="1282.72" dur="3.92">integrating what the feedback is and</text><text start="1284.32" dur="4.8">then passing proposals so that is the</text><text start="1286.64" dur="5.2">first thing and uh from that so that&apos;s</text><text start="1289.12" dur="5.2">sociocracy holacracy we are now evolved</text><text start="1291.84" dur="4.56">to form it that is a</text><text start="1294.32" dur="4.16">nice template from the ready that we</text><text start="1296.4" dur="4.399">often work with and</text><text start="1298.48" dur="4.48">we call it an action meeting and this is</text><text start="1300.799" dur="4.801">more</text><text start="1302.96" dur="4.32">an evolution into a format where we have</text><text start="1305.6" dur="3.76">more of a sort of stand-up meeting and</text><text start="1307.28" dur="3.84">it&apos;s like okay i have this point and</text><text start="1309.36" dur="3.12">this is the next steps that i need and</text><text start="1311.12" dur="2.24">these are the outcomes that i want to</text><text start="1312.48" dur="2.72">get to</text><text start="1313.36" dur="3.84">and uh most of the things we try to do</text><text start="1315.2" dur="3.76">async because it has been mentioned</text><text start="1317.2" dur="3.04">before both for this viewers it&apos;s for</text><text start="1318.96" dur="3.36">the contributors</text><text start="1320.24" dur="4.08">uh there&apos;s always this fight for like</text><text start="1322.32" dur="4.16">the available time so we try to</text><text start="1324.32" dur="4.16">constantly optimize and get to a format</text><text start="1326.48" dur="4.079">that works for most of the people</text><text start="1328.48" dur="4.48">that counts for both work stream leads</text><text start="1330.559" dur="4.401">and contributors as well as stewards so</text><text start="1332.96" dur="4.4">that is that level that um i&apos;ve been</text><text start="1334.96" dur="4.48">focusing most on</text><text start="1337.36" dur="3.679">great so cross stream dao ops is the</text><text start="1339.44" dur="3.359">body that</text><text start="1341.039" dur="3.921">is where work stream leads come together</text><text start="1342.799" dur="4.321">and make decisions with the context that</text><text start="1344.96" dur="4.56">they have and it sounds like it started</text><text start="1347.12" dur="4.4">off as a holocracy sort of consent based</text><text start="1349.52" dur="5.36">decision making the legitimacy comes</text><text start="1351.52" dur="5.76">from the consent of of the other people</text><text start="1354.88" dur="4.64">in the work streams um</text><text start="1357.28" dur="3.759">anything else to add about csgo chris</text><text start="1359.52" dur="3.44">yeah um</text><text start="1361.039" dur="4.961">no i think i think that kind of explains</text><text start="1362.96" dur="5.36">we can go deeper into into other parts</text><text start="1366.0" dur="4.799">of this but it&apos;s it&apos;s definitely it&apos;s a</text><text start="1368.32" dur="4.88">continuous evolution on figuring out</text><text start="1370.799" dur="4.24">what works so it&apos;s like we always end</text><text start="1373.2" dur="3.52">with our checkout where the main</text><text start="1375.039" dur="4.561">question actually is like how can we</text><text start="1376.72" dur="4.24">improve this goal um like the first one</text><text start="1379.6" dur="2.88">time we even asked like how can we</text><text start="1380.96" dur="3.199">improve it ten percent because that&apos;s</text><text start="1382.48" dur="4.079">the goal like all these processes need</text><text start="1384.159" dur="4.721">to evolve the entire time so it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="1386.559" dur="4.801">been an interesting journey yeah dow</text><text start="1388.88" dur="4.72">governance has sort of been an iterative</text><text start="1391.36" dur="4.24">game has been what i what i&apos;ve seen that</text><text start="1393.6" dur="4.4">might be a good segue into talking about</text><text start="1395.6" dur="5.199">seasons which i think maybe simona you</text><text start="1398.0" dur="5.52">might be qualified to do uh you want to</text><text start="1400.799" dur="4.321">tell us about how dow governance what it</text><text start="1403.52" dur="3.12">looked like when you came into it and</text><text start="1405.12" dur="3.28">how you organized it into seasons when</text><text start="1406.64" dur="2.72">you came in um</text><text start="1408.4" dur="1.92">yes</text><text start="1409.36" dur="2.88">so</text><text start="1410.32" dur="4.32">i think</text><text start="1412.24" dur="4.64">because we&apos;re talking about evolution</text><text start="1414.64" dur="4.399">right and we can</text><text start="1416.88" dur="4.08">go in the natural realm a little bit</text><text start="1419.039" dur="4.561">which i know that where we might do a</text><text start="1420.96" dur="4.079">little bit later but obviously seasons</text><text start="1423.6" dur="3.52">just makes</text><text start="1425.039" dur="3.361">a lot of sense when you think about</text><text start="1427.12" dur="4.48">cadence</text><text start="1428.4" dur="5.279">and to to make sense of</text><text start="1431.6" dur="5.12">a landscape or to make sense of</text><text start="1433.679" dur="5.6">something you want a particular pattern</text><text start="1436.72" dur="3.439">that you can recognize and you can move</text><text start="1439.279" dur="2.64">with</text><text start="1440.159" dur="4.64">and so</text><text start="1441.919" dur="6.161">aligning the budgets for work streams</text><text start="1444.799" dur="6.641">with grants rounds just made a lot a lot</text><text start="1448.08" dur="5.599">of sense in in terms of that attention</text><text start="1451.44" dur="3.28">versus action dynamic that i mentioned</text><text start="1453.679" dur="2.081">earlier</text><text start="1454.72" dur="4.079">because</text><text start="1455.76" dur="5.84">if the attention is on bitcoin for the</text><text start="1458.799" dur="4.561">grants rounds then we would want to</text><text start="1461.6" dur="5.12">capture that attention</text><text start="1463.36" dur="6.08">and that action and have it apply to</text><text start="1466.72" dur="5.6">potentially other things that are dow</text><text start="1469.44" dur="5.92">related or that are bitcoin related and</text><text start="1472.32" dur="5.92">so having this cadence that aligns with</text><text start="1475.36" dur="4.72">the grants just made complete sense in</text><text start="1478.24" dur="3.679">terms of</text><text start="1480.08" dur="4.56">um creating</text><text start="1481.919" dur="4.961">that pattern of it&apos;s happening from here</text><text start="1484.64" dur="4.159">to here this is the focus and this is</text><text start="1486.88" dur="4.799">what we&apos;re doing here is a list of</text><text start="1488.799" dur="5.281">actions that we take here um the the</text><text start="1491.679" dur="4.321">important dates here is when we make the</text><text start="1494.08" dur="4.32">decision here is how it flows and</text><text start="1496.0" dur="5.52">everybody is aligned with that</text><text start="1498.4" dur="4.96">i think the reason why that&apos;s very very</text><text start="1501.52" dur="4.0">important is again</text><text start="1503.36" dur="4.08">you want to make sure that the energy</text><text start="1505.52" dur="5.84">that people put in</text><text start="1507.44" dur="5.04">is used to its maximum potential whereas</text><text start="1511.36" dur="2.0">before</text><text start="1512.48" dur="2.88">you</text><text start="1513.36" dur="3.919">if it&apos;s not if it doesn&apos;t have a</text><text start="1515.36" dur="4.96">semblance of a pattern or some sort of</text><text start="1517.279" dur="5.441">organization it can very easily go in a</text><text start="1520.32" dur="5.44">lot of it but it doesn&apos;t it isn&apos;t</text><text start="1522.72" dur="5.36">directed properly and it can dissipate</text><text start="1525.76" dur="4.48">and it can cause frustration for</text><text start="1528.08" dur="5.839">everybody involved because if i have to</text><text start="1530.24" dur="5.439">come back to a proposal to proposals for</text><text start="1533.919" dur="4.64">six months every single day a different</text><text start="1535.679" dur="4.0">proposal that might not be beneficial</text><text start="1538.559" dur="3.921">because</text><text start="1539.679" dur="5.441">we are human beings we have rhythms we</text><text start="1542.48" dur="4.64">sometimes sleep we sometimes do other</text><text start="1545.12" dur="2.96">things which is okay</text><text start="1547.12" dur="3.919">and so</text><text start="1548.08" dur="5.28">having that cadence ensures that we have</text><text start="1551.039" dur="4.64">that balance that i mentioned earlier</text><text start="1553.36" dur="5.04">and it&apos;s important to have that and</text><text start="1555.679" dur="5.041">maintain it and evolve it so that we get</text><text start="1558.4" dur="4.399">even better at it so that was the</text><text start="1560.72" dur="4.559">reasoning behind seasons</text><text start="1562.799" dur="3.921">um and aligning things that way</text><text start="1565.279" dur="3.76">all right we just heard the reason</text><text start="1566.72" dur="2.319">behind the</text><text start="1569.279" dur="5.76">the reason seasons the seasons</text><text start="1572.08" dur="5.599">yeah i maybe what i would immediately</text><text start="1575.039" dur="5.281">makes me think of is like both</text><text start="1577.679" dur="4.561">being both a steward and a contributor</text><text start="1580.32" dur="3.92">that was personally very interesting to</text><text start="1582.24" dur="5.36">me because then when you&apos;re on both</text><text start="1584.24" dur="5.52">sides you see the amount of work indeed</text><text start="1587.6" dur="4.079">that stewards get with like the</text><text start="1589.76" dur="4.0">these these these three monthly reviews</text><text start="1591.679" dur="3.921">of budgets etc and that was like</text><text start="1593.76" dur="4.08">that&apos;s what what i think everyone on</text><text start="1595.6" dur="4.48">this call has just like also seen like</text><text start="1597.84" dur="4.4">when we constantly got this feedback of</text><text start="1600.08" dur="3.44">like okay how can we make this better</text><text start="1602.24" dur="4.08">and that&apos;s also where we&apos;re currently</text><text start="1603.52" dur="4.639">like evaluating like how can we maybe</text><text start="1606.32" dur="4.32">morph the seasons into</text><text start="1608.159" dur="4.4">a longer period or maybe do some other</text><text start="1610.64" dur="4.32">optimizations because</text><text start="1612.559" dur="4.48">it is a lot it takes a lot of people to</text><text start="1614.96" dur="3.76">actually really dive in and we do</text><text start="1617.039" dur="4.961">realize this because we we went through</text><text start="1618.72" dur="4.8">it ourselves and also just um to come</text><text start="1622.0" dur="4.559">back to that point and i know that linda</text><text start="1623.52" dur="4.72">you had a tweet earlier and it&apos;s so true</text><text start="1626.559" dur="3.841">in the beginning that there used to be</text><text start="1628.24" dur="4.319">these votes that would literally be put</text><text start="1630.4" dur="5.12">up for like three days and it would</text><text start="1632.559" dur="5.281">start on a friday and finish on a sunday</text><text start="1635.52" dur="5.84">at 12 am and you go</text><text start="1637.84" dur="5.36">give me a just like a tiny break and</text><text start="1641.36" dur="2.96">they&apos;re like i really had an opinion oh</text><text start="1643.2" dur="2.0">too late</text><text start="1644.32" dur="4.0">so</text><text start="1645.2" dur="4.959">the point when when you start thinking</text><text start="1648.32" dur="3.92">about these things and this is the big</text><text start="1650.159" dur="4.721">thing this is why we need to do this</text><text start="1652.24" dur="5.12">mindfully because you have to account</text><text start="1654.88" dur="4.159">for the fact that the technology is very</text><text start="1657.36" dur="3.919">powerful and it does</text><text start="1659.039" dur="4.561">many wonderful things</text><text start="1661.279" dur="4.961">but it&apos;s still</text><text start="1663.6" dur="3.84">people are still involved in it you</text><text start="1666.24" dur="6.159">cannot</text><text start="1667.44" dur="6.64">remove the human element from thinking</text><text start="1672.399" dur="3.361">when you&apos;re thinking about patterns and</text><text start="1674.08" dur="4.24">flows and things that you put in place</text><text start="1675.76" dur="4.88">you simply cannot and</text><text start="1678.32" dur="5.359">it only creates frustration if you are</text><text start="1680.64" dur="5.919">not mindful of these</text><text start="1683.679" dur="5.441">again seasons in people&apos;s lives the ups</text><text start="1686.559" dur="5.041">and downs the ebbs and flows it&apos;s</text><text start="1689.12" dur="4.08">important to account for those it&apos;s</text><text start="1691.6" dur="3.6">important to bait those in and yes</text><text start="1693.2" dur="4.479">sometimes it takes a little bit longer</text><text start="1695.2" dur="5.92">yes sometimes the vote is up for way too</text><text start="1697.679" dur="4.641">long two days too long or here and there</text><text start="1701.12" dur="3.36">niggling</text><text start="1702.32" dur="4.56">uh delays let&apos;s say</text><text start="1704.48" dur="5.199">but they are there potentially for a</text><text start="1706.88" dur="5.679">reason and when we evolve it we must</text><text start="1709.679" dur="6.88">find out what that optimum</text><text start="1712.559" dur="6.161">window of voting is and how do we do it</text><text start="1716.559" dur="4.801">and when does it happen and what are the</text><text start="1718.72" dur="5.6">steps before that so that again it all</text><text start="1721.36" dur="3.76">flows and it doesn&apos;t frustrate anybody</text><text start="1724.32" dur="2.079">or</text><text start="1725.12" dur="4.159">it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1726.399" dur="4.961">stop anybody from genuinely making an</text><text start="1729.279" dur="4.161">informed decision and hopefully a</text><text start="1731.36" dur="4.319">valuable contribution</text><text start="1733.44"

rubber stamping</text><text start="1740.96" dur="3.36">things because you&apos;re running out of</text><text start="1742.24" dur="5.12">time because you have 30 minutes until a</text><text start="1744.32" dur="5.2">vote closes right like all of those</text><text start="1747.36" dur="5.199">things and being um</text><text start="1749.52" dur="6.399">careful about how you align those things</text><text start="1752.559" dur="5.441">is very important if we want this stuff</text><text start="1755.919" dur="4.561">to genuinely become</text><text start="1758.0" dur="4.48">the things

dur="1.679">that</text><text start="1765.6" dur="2.079">we&apos;re</text><text start="1766.399" dur="3.121">you know we can kind of look at the</text><text start="1767.679" dur="3.201">seasons

good</text><text start="2014.159" dur="4.24">sense and will continue to iterate on</text><text start="2016.48" dur="2.88">this um</text><text start="2018.399" dur="3.28">and like</text><text start="2019.36" dur="5.12">by adding some rules to it like we have</text><text start="2021.679" dur="5.441">for example the thing of um a proposal</text><text start="2024.48" dur="5.84">cannot go to snapshot if not five</text><text start="2027.12" dur="5.76">stewards have commented and then um we</text><text start="2030.32" dur="3.28">refined that to like saying like if you</text><text start="2032.88" dur="2.32">are</text><text start="2033.6" dur="2.88">a steward but you&apos;re also in the work</text><text start="2035.2" dur="3.839">stream well we&apos;re not really going to</text><text start="2036.48" dur="3.76">count your vote or your comments so it&apos;s</text><text start="2039.039" dur="3.601">like these little things that we&apos;ve</text><text start="2040.24" dur="4.48">tweaked to make sure that um</text><text start="2042.64" dur="4.48">then we get more input</text><text start="2044.72" dur="4.24">so that&apos;s one thing um</text><text start="2047.12" dur="3.759">i think the steward council that we now</text><text start="2048.96" dur="3.36">have which is which is like a selection</text><text start="2050.879" dur="3.361">of the stewards where we can dive a</text><text start="2052.32" dur="3.359">little bit deeper it&apos;s also a positive</text><text start="2054.24" dur="3.439">evolution there</text><text start="2055.679" dur="3.601">um that comes to mind</text><text start="2057.679" dur="4.081">and i guess the third one that</text><text start="2059.28" dur="5.28">immediately comes to mind is um is the</text><text start="2061.76" dur="5.2">bear market um i i really love it</text><text start="2064.56" dur="4.0">because like suddenly the stewards have</text><text start="2066.96" dur="4.159">become uh some of the stewards have</text><text start="2068.56" dur="4.799">become way more um</text><text start="2071.119" dur="4.641">yes really getting into big debates on</text><text start="2073.359" dur="4.48">like why are we funding this and i love</text><text start="2075.76" dur="3.52">it it&apos;s fantastic we should always have</text><text start="2077.839" dur="4.401">this whether it&apos;s a bull or a bear</text><text start="2079.28" dur="4.48">market like having these these very</text><text start="2082.24" dur="4.08">deep discussions is like does it</text><text start="2083.76" dur="3.76">actually make sense that we fund this or</text><text start="2086.32" dur="3.12">not</text><text start="2087.52" dur="4.0">and this actually led to deeper</text><text start="2089.44" dur="4.959">discussions within the work streams as</text><text start="2091.52" dur="4.639">well within csdo and like we really need</text><text start="2094.399" dur="4.161">to need to now fast track everything</text><text start="2096.159" dur="4.561">that has to do with what is the purpose</text><text start="2098.56" dur="5.76">of git going down what do we want to</text><text start="2100.72" dur="5.28">fund what are our main</text><text start="2104.32" dur="3.84">goals that we want to achieve so and</text><text start="2106.0" dur="4.56">that&apos;s the thing that then became what</text><text start="2108.16" dur="4.88">we now call our purpose and essential</text><text start="2110.56" dur="5.84">intents and so this is another tool that</text><text start="2113.04" dur="5.92">helps stewards to actually like evaluate</text><text start="2116.4" dur="4.24">does it make sense to um to actually</text><text start="2118.96" dur="4.08">fund this is this really aligned with</text><text start="2120.64" dur="4.719">the mission and the values and the goals</text><text start="2123.04" dur="3.76">of get coin and yeah i think there&apos;s</text><text start="2125.359" dur="2.961">lots of little steps that we&apos;re doing</text><text start="2126.8" dur="5.36">here</text><text start="2128.32" dur="6.96">and i think it&apos;s very much around</text><text start="2132.16" dur="5.919">this theme of</text><text start="2135.28" dur="5.92">transparency and making sure so this is</text><text start="2138.079" dur="5.04">one of my main goals that everything</text><text start="2141.2" dur="5.36">that we do</text><text start="2143.119" dur="5.841">is as transparent as possible and also</text><text start="2146.56" dur="5.36">as objective as possible when we make</text><text start="2148.96" dur="5.52">decisions about things which is why</text><text start="2151.92" dur="4.48">having clarity around</text><text start="2154.48" dur="4.879">the purpose and essential intent is</text><text start="2156.4" dur="4.64">important which is why having</text><text start="2159.359" dur="3.921">clarity on</text><text start="2161.04" dur="5.36">what the engagement is around the</text><text start="2163.28" dur="5.92">stewards and the stores that then become</text><text start="2166.4" dur="5.28">part of the steward council is there</text><text start="2169.2" dur="5.36">because again to linda&apos;s point there are</text><text start="2171.68" dur="5.6">so many people in the various different</text><text start="2174.56" dur="5.6">dows out there that i</text><text start="2177.28" dur="5.92">you have no way of knowing are they</text><text start="2180.16" dur="5.52">present are they taking time to look</text><text start="2183.2" dur="3.44">through the proposals to understand the</text><text start="2185.68" dur="3.6">impact</text><text start="2186.64" dur="5.439">of a budget request or some sort of</text><text start="2189.28" dur="4.64">funding request on the treasury of that</text><text start="2192.079" dur="4.401">particular dow</text><text start="2193.92" dur="5.52">is there a process what is the process</text><text start="2196.48" dur="5.359">and so for me having these things very</text><text start="2199.44" dur="5.76">very clear not just for the people</text><text start="2201.839" dur="5.921">within the dao but for the outside</text><text start="2205.2" dur="4.879">world for the ecosystem and potentially</text><text start="2207.76" dur="6.48">having it again as patterns that can be</text><text start="2210.079" dur="7.04">adopted and can be taken</text><text start="2214.24" dur="4.24">again open source containers for people</text><text start="2217.119" dur="3.601">to use</text><text start="2218.48" dur="5.28">to ensure that their decision making</text><text start="2220.72" dur="5.52">process and their governance process is</text><text start="2223.76" dur="5.44">as transparent and hopefully as</text><text start="2226.24" dur="6.56">flowing as we&apos;re trying to make the</text><text start="2229.2" dur="6.159">gitcoin one be and i think um ens</text><text start="2232.8" dur="5.039">recently well i think in the past couple</text><text start="2235.359" dur="5.121">of months they&apos;ve actually um</text><text start="2237.839" dur="3.441">forked the steward health cards that we</text><text start="2240.48" dur="3.359">have</text><text start="2241.28" dur="5.12">that tracks engagement and tracks</text><text start="2243.839" dur="4.321">engagement in the last 30 days whereas</text><text start="2246.4" dur="4.4">before we had it all</text><text start="2248.16" dur="4.48">like lifetime now we&apos;re doing it in a</text><text start="2250.8" dur="3.44">way that you can actually see when</text><text start="2252.64" dur="3.84">somebody has dropped off which are</text><text start="2254.24" dur="5.2">absolutely fine that they have and if</text><text start="2256.48" dur="4.56">they have again things happen you your</text><text start="2259.44" dur="4.24">attention goes elsewhere that&apos;s</text><text start="2261.04" dur="5.2">absolutely fine but everybody delegating</text><text start="2263.68" dur="5.04">and everybody involved should know or</text><text start="2266.24" dur="4.24">should be able to see and so i was</text><text start="2268.72" dur="4.56">really really pleased to see them</text><text start="2270.48" dur="4.879">forking it and really focusing on okay</text><text start="2273.28" dur="4.96">this is a bit of tooling that actually</text><text start="2275.359" dur="4.48">is very very important particularly if</text><text start="2278.24" dur="4.64">we want to move towards a fluid</text><text start="2279.839" dur="5.441">governance model right again coming back</text><text start="2282.88" dur="4.719">to accounting for the fact that we are</text><text start="2285.28" dur="5.44">all humans and we want this to work but</text><text start="2287.599" dur="4.0">also want to maybe sleep sometimes</text><text start="2290.72" dur="3.359">so</text><text start="2291.599" dur="4.081">it&apos;s like it&apos;s a very very</text><text start="2294.079" dur="4.881">um</text><text start="2295.68" dur="5.679">i would say a very nice and really kind</text><text start="2298.96" dur="4.0">of fast evolution i would say like i</text><text start="2301.359" dur="3.841">have these things that we&apos;ve put in</text><text start="2302.96" dur="4.399">place but again in the last six months</text><text start="2305.2" dur="4.24">or rather a little bit less even um</text><text start="2307.359" dur="4.24">since february when we started putting</text><text start="2309.44" dur="4.96">all of these things in place i think has</text><text start="2311.599" dur="5.201">been really really good</text><text start="2314.4" dur="4.8">yeah maybe mentioning the the</text><text start="2316.8" dur="3.44">health cards like um that this is</text><text start="2319.2" dur="3.28">something</text><text start="2320.24" dur="4.56">what it actually is so we used to call</text><text start="2322.48" dur="4.0">it like the stewards report cards</text><text start="2324.8" dur="3.279">but that that sounded maybe a little bit</text><text start="2326.48" dur="4.8">too high schooly so that&apos;s like the</text><text start="2328.079" dur="6.161">health cards and it gives like a score</text><text start="2331.28" dur="4.72">on like how well stewards are doing in</text><text start="2334.24" dur="3.119">the sense of like it it takes a number</text><text start="2336.0" dur="2.96">of</text><text start="2337.359" dur="5.201">elements into account like how many</text><text start="2338.96" dur="5.6">times you have um responded on the forum</text><text start="2342.56" dur="3.68">how many times you have voted how many</text><text start="2344.56" dur="4.08">votes you actually have delegated to</text><text start="2346.24" dur="4.24">yourself etc and it gives you this</text><text start="2348.64" dur="4.16">activity score that that is a really</text><text start="2350.48" dur="4.08">good i gives a good representation of</text><text start="2352.8" dur="4.64">how active you are as a steward but</text><text start="2354.56" dur="6.799">actually that&apos;s in the beginning it used</text><text start="2357.44" dur="5.84">to just be the voting and i believe some</text><text start="2361.359" dur="2.881">sort of forum activity</text><text start="2363.28" dur="3.6">and</text><text start="2364.24" dur="5.2">the reason why i really wanted us to</text><text start="2366.88" dur="4.88">evolve that is because there are so many</text><text start="2369.44" dur="4.399">stewards who are also contributors there</text><text start="2371.76" dur="4.24">are so many stewards who are also part</text><text start="2373.839" dur="4.081">of some of the work streams so we</text><text start="2376.0" dur="4.839">started pulling</text><text start="2377.92" dur="5.12">some qualitative metrics not just the</text><text start="2380.839" dur="4.841">voting how many times have you done it</text><text start="2383.04" dur="5.36">because that&apos;s so easy okay i voted</text><text start="2385.68" dur="3.679">10 times great i&apos;m super engaged</text><text start="2388.4" dur="3.36">but</text><text start="2389.359" dur="4.48">coupling that with the comments with</text><text start="2391.76" dur="5.839">participating in the work streams with</text><text start="2393.839" dur="5.601">doing a lot of active engagement like</text><text start="2397.599" dur="3.841">being on the calls being on the steward</text><text start="2399.44" dur="4.48">calls being on the steward council calls</text><text start="2401.44" dur="5.44">and really having that</text><text start="2403.92" dur="5.84">a true finger on the engagement pulse</text><text start="2406.88" dur="5.36">has been very very telling on a lot of</text><text start="2409.76" dur="4.0">those metrics which is again wonderful</text><text start="2412.24" dur="3.119">to see</text><text start="2413.76" dur="3.359">i think one of the one of the problems</text><text start="2415.359" dur="3.681">that we tried to solve which you all</text><text start="2417.119" dur="4.72">have called out is that</text><text start="2419.04" dur="4.16">whenever we launched the token we had</text><text start="2421.839" dur="3.121">this awesome sort of claim and</text><text start="2423.2" dur="2.879">delegation experience but a lot of those</text><text start="2424.96" dur="3.2">delegates</text><text start="2426.079" dur="3.52">over a year&apos;s time period their interest</text><text start="2428.16" dur="3.12">has waned they&apos;ve gotten involved in</text><text start="2429.599" dur="3.121">other projects they&apos;ve been really</text><text start="2431.28" dur="2.64">focused on the merge like there&apos;s a</text><text start="2432.72" dur="3.359">number of things that have come up that</text><text start="2433.92" dur="4.0">just pulled people away and so</text><text start="2436.079" dur="3.441">building out those stewards report cards</text><text start="2437.92" dur="2.56">and setting them to the 30-day frequency</text><text start="2439.52" dur="3.52">have just been</text><text start="2440.48" dur="5.04">um a really great way for us to evaluate</text><text start="2443.04" dur="3.92">like who&apos;s actually active in community</text><text start="2445.52" dur="3.12">so that folks can go through and</text><text start="2446.96" dur="3.52">re-delegate so we can make sure that</text><text start="2448.64" dur="4.24">those stewards are active in the</text><text start="2450.48" dur="4.639">community still and those that are most</text><text start="2452.88" dur="4.479">active actually have the voice</text><text start="2455.119" dur="3.681">um to kind of represent what they want</text><text start="2457.359" dur="3.601">to see inside of the protocol</text><text start="2458.8" dur="4.48">development inside of the grants program</text><text start="2460.96" dur="4.159">itself as well</text><text start="2463.28" dur="3.76">um one of the other areas that really</text><text start="2465.119" dur="3.761">kind of stood out to me</text><text start="2467.04" dur="3.039">i think is mostly in like work stream</text><text start="2468.88" dur="2.8">mandates</text><text start="2470.079" dur="2.961">it&apos;s been interesting to kind of see how</text><text start="2471.68" dur="4.159">work streams have</text><text start="2473.04" dur="5.039">formed and sort of evolved over the year</text><text start="2475.839" dur="5.601">and then come back to like a core thesis</text><text start="2478.079" dur="5.28">especially during this build market as</text><text start="2481.44" dur="4.639">some folks have been staying</text><text start="2483.359" dur="5.201">during this bear i think that&apos;s one of</text><text start="2486.079" dur="4.321">the places where um you know we have</text><text start="2488.56" dur="3.36">very much appreciated more steward</text><text start="2490.4" dur="4.0">involvement and delegating to the</text><text start="2491.92" dur="4.72">stewards who are more activists to help</text><text start="2494.4" dur="4.24">align some of those incentives</text><text start="2496.64" dur="4.32">but i think um one of the things that&apos;s</text><text start="2498.64" dur="4.0">been great about this build market is it</text><text start="2500.96" dur="4.0">really has brought the dow closer</text><text start="2502.64" dur="3.679">together um whenever the dow first</text><text start="2504.96" dur="3.28">launch we sort of saw like this</text><text start="2506.319" dur="4.0">explosion of autonomy across work</text><text start="2508.24" dur="4.16">streams and i think a lot of the dao is</text><text start="2510.319" dur="3.681">starting to realize that like oh if we</text><text start="2512.4" dur="3.28">coordinate if we work together like we</text><text start="2514.0" dur="3.359">can get to a better collective outcome</text><text start="2515.68" dur="2.399">than like my work stream could on its</text><text start="2517.359" dur="2.48">own</text><text start="2518.079" dur="4.481">and it&apos;s like whoa like that&apos;s not</text><text start="2519.839" dur="4.161">mind-blowing information here yet but um</text><text start="2522.56" dur="3.279">i think it&apos;s through some of the</text><text start="2524.0" dur="3.76">difficult conversations on you know</text><text start="2525.839" dur="3.841">evaluation of like the purpose of the</text><text start="2527.76" dur="3.52">dao and the essential intent like chris</text><text start="2529.68" dur="4.08">talked about but like we&apos;ve been able to</text><text start="2531.28" dur="4.24">really focus and kind of move more</text><text start="2533.76" dur="3.359">together as a dao</text><text start="2535.52" dur="4.0">instead of in different directions as</text><text start="2537.119" dur="4.881">work streams so i&apos;ve appreciated that</text><text start="2539.52" dur="5.2">evolution over time and um steward&apos;s</text><text start="2542.0" dur="4.64">helping guide us to that outcome and</text><text start="2544.72" dur="4.24">really just kind of getting closer and</text><text start="2546.64" dur="4.4">closer to that protocol state and</text><text start="2548.96" dur="3.6">launching you know git coins protocols</text><text start="2551.04" dur="3.36">as well i was going to say i can add</text><text start="2552.56" dur="4.0">another one that i feel like we&apos;re</text><text start="2554.4" dur="3.12">working towards improving but generally</text><text start="2556.56" dur="3.68">just</text><text start="2557.52" dur="4.0">compensation structures for delegates</text><text start="2560.24" dur="3.04">i&apos;m</text><text start="2561.52" dur="4.0">it is a lot of work and it&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2563.28" dur="3.52">time spent on this and</text><text start="2565.52" dur="2.72">i definitely want people to be in a</text><text start="2566.8" dur="3.12">situation where</text><text start="2568.24" dur="3.119">they&apos;re not feeling that you know just</text><text start="2569.92" dur="3.439">because the dow&apos;s not paying them they</text><text start="2571.359" dur="3.441">can&apos;t spend their attention on this even</text><text start="2573.359" dur="4.081">though they really care about what the</text><text start="2574.8" dur="4.559">dow is doing and so we are moving</text><text start="2577.44" dur="3.76">towards like we&apos;ve had discussions</text><text start="2579.359" dur="4.641">around you know compensating at least</text><text start="2581.2" dur="4.8">the gas that people have spent on uh</text><text start="2584.0" dur="3.68">voting for these proposals which i&apos;m</text><text start="2586.0" dur="3.44">really appreciative of i think that</text><text start="2587.68" dur="4.639">helps people because at one point gas</text><text start="2589.44" dur="5.44">was quite expensive um and then also</text><text start="2592.319" dur="5.361">just um we&apos;ve had like a git coin</text><text start="2594.88" dur="5.52">payment um towards or a bitcoin token</text><text start="2597.68" dur="4.32">payment towards the council um but i</text><text start="2600.4" dur="4.4">think that amount can definitely be</text><text start="2602.0" dur="4.4">reevaluated but i would really like um</text><text start="2604.8" dur="3.2">yeah us to continue having that</text><text start="2606.4" dur="3.52">conversation around like how can we make</text><text start="2608.0" dur="4.64">sure people feel compensated for their</text><text start="2609.92" dur="5.12">time since it has been a year of of work</text><text start="2612.64" dur="4.4">from a lot of people and um</text><text start="2615.04" dur="3.12">many calls many forum reviews and stuff</text><text start="2617.04" dur="3.92">like that</text><text start="2618.16" dur="4.4">totally and yeah we</text><text start="2620.96" dur="4.32">yeah it&apos;s definitely something that that</text><text start="2622.56" dur="5.039">is top of mind to work on um</text><text start="2625.28" dur="4.16">so actually swann and i were also just</text><text start="2627.599" dur="4.0">discussing on the</text><text start="2629.44" dur="4.399">on on the entire thing of like we have</text><text start="2631.599" dur="4.321">so many stewards also who applied i</text><text start="2633.839" dur="4.0">think it&apos;s like 400 plus people right</text><text start="2635.92" dur="3.72">who also said like i want to be a</text><text start="2637.839" dur="3.76">steward but that we want to like</text><text start="2639.64" dur="3.88">re-engage and like</text><text start="2641.599" dur="3.681">check in with them and see like hey</text><text start="2643.52" dur="3.36">would you have time</text><text start="2645.28" dur="3.28">but then indeed like there is a question</text><text start="2646.88" dur="4.239">of like how do you incentivize them the</text><text start="2648.56" dur="4.799">steward card health cards is one but</text><text start="2651.119" dur="3.681">there can also be like a financial</text><text start="2653.359" dur="3.441">component to it</text><text start="2654.8" dur="4.08">but that needs to be like reasonable of</text><text start="2656.8" dur="3.519">course because we want we want people to</text><text start="2658.88" dur="3.439">to really come because they believe in</text><text start="2660.319" dur="3.361">the mission but at the same time like</text><text start="2662.319" dur="3.681">how do you</text><text start="2663.68" dur="4.08">um yeah also take into account that</text><text start="2666.0" dur="3.359">that we are still in a world where</text><text start="2667.76" dur="3.359">people um</text><text start="2669.359" dur="3.201">need to need to just pay for their</text><text start="2671.119" dur="4.641">living and if they spend a lot of time</text><text start="2672.56" dur="6.0">on this like how can we justify this so</text><text start="2675.76" dur="5.04">it is not an easy an easy subject but um</text><text start="2678.56" dur="4.24">it&apos;s definitely yeah very high on our</text><text start="2680.8" dur="4.72">list and it&apos;s a really interesting</text><text start="2682.8" dur="5.12">subject because like the</text><text start="2685.52" dur="5.04">the level of compensation that we all</text><text start="2687.92" dur="4.8">voted on i can&apos;t remember when it was</text><text start="2690.56" dur="5.039">maybe it was march</text><text start="2692.72" dur="4.8">or end of march beginning of april at</text><text start="2695.599" dur="3.041">that point was</text><text start="2697.52" dur="3.68">good</text><text start="2698.64" dur="5.28">and we chose the lowest tier out of the</text><text start="2701.2" dur="5.6">three tiers and so it&apos;s such an</text><text start="2703.92" dur="4.24">interesting dynamic because obviously in</text><text start="2706.8" dur="3.6">our space</text><text start="2708.16" dur="6.4">you have to account for</text><text start="2710.4" dur="5.679">that potential of a fluctuation if it</text><text start="2714.56" dur="4.16">exists or</text><text start="2716.079" dur="5.121">to take into account hey</text><text start="2718.72" dur="4.879">when we started with the council maybe</text><text start="2721.2" dur="3.68">we didn&apos;t envisage just how many hours</text><text start="2723.599" dur="2.961">it would be</text><text start="2724.88" dur="4.239">and so i think</text><text start="2726.56" dur="7.279">again just uh rewarding with more</text><text start="2729.119" dur="7.281">governance rights is something that is</text><text start="2733.839" dur="4.561">should happen right because you are</text><text start="2736.4" dur="4.4">involved you want to and you are</text><text start="2738.4" dur="5.04">consistently involved consistently</text><text start="2740.8" dur="5.68">engaged and so it makes sense to get</text><text start="2743.44" dur="5.679">even more governance rights but i think</text><text start="2746.48" dur="6.96">figuring out what</text><text start="2749.119" dur="6.96">a dynamic of or a combination</text><text start="2753.44" dur="5.52">could be that actually does</text><text start="2756.079" dur="5.121">incentivize people to give more of their</text><text start="2758.96" dur="3.92">time to this versus</text><text start="2761.2" dur="3.2">doing this in their free time and then</text><text start="2762.88" dur="3.12">trying to stretch something that can</text><text start="2764.4" dur="6.64">actually pay their bills</text><text start="2766.0" dur="9.119">and and this is i would say is</text><text start="2771.04" dur="6.72">a condition of our current state right</text><text start="2775.119" dur="4.641">of our current status within this this</text><text start="2777.76" dur="4.96">ecosystem because</text><text start="2779.76" dur="4.079">we don&apos;t have a full protocol politician</text><text start="2782.72" dur="4.16">role</text><text start="2783.839" dur="5.76">very well defined and somebody that just</text><text start="2786.88" dur="4.64">is present in the governance of a lot of</text><text start="2789.599" dur="3.281">different dows and they bring their</text><text start="2791.52" dur="2.48">expertise</text><text start="2792.88" dur="4.0">and their</text><text start="2794.0" dur="5.52">um you know their their opinions and</text><text start="2796.88" dur="5.199">their um valuable skills</text><text start="2799.52" dur="5.44">to each of those dows and that is in</text><text start="2802.079" dur="4.481">itself incredibly valuable um</text><text start="2804.96" dur="3.92">so i think we&apos;ll we&apos;ll see a lot of</text><text start="2806.56" dur="3.92">those models evolve and i would love for</text><text start="2808.88" dur="3.84">free bitcoin to be a</text><text start="2810.48" dur="4.8">big part of that because we&apos;re preparing</text><text start="2812.72" dur="4.8">for you know the the end of the first</text><text start="2815.28" dur="4.16">steward council and i want us to do a</text><text start="2817.52" dur="3.76">big retro and see okay</text><text start="2819.44" dur="4.159">what do we need to do better what do we</text><text start="2821.28" dur="4.4">need to think about what do we need to</text><text start="2823.599" dur="4.48">make sure that we have in mind for the</text><text start="2825.68" dur="4.88">next one and even when we set it up it</text><text start="2828.079" dur="5.361">was very much supposed to be hey let&apos;s</text><text start="2830.56" dur="5.44">see if this is something that works and</text><text start="2833.44" dur="4.32">in my opinion it really does because it</text><text start="2836.0" dur="2.56">does help us have</text><text start="2837.76" dur="3.68">um</text><text start="2838.56" dur="5.039">higher level discussions and potentially</text><text start="2841.44" dur="4.639">difficult discussions sometimes</text><text start="2843.599" dur="4.321">about the future of the dao and let&apos;s</text><text start="2846.079" dur="3.76">see how how we evolve that to make it</text><text start="2847.92" dur="3.12">something that is sustainable and is</text><text start="2849.839" dur="4.161">something that</text><text start="2851.04" dur="5.92">is valuable for people and their time</text><text start="2854.0" dur="4.64">totally thanks simona uh at this point i</text><text start="2856.96" dur="2.96">think it&apos;s my job as the timekeeper to</text><text start="2858.64" dur="3.12">note that we only have about five</text><text start="2859.92" dur="3.439">minutes left so let&apos;s maybe get into</text><text start="2861.76" dur="3.28">final thoughts is there anything that i</text><text start="2863.359" dur="3.76">didn&apos;t ask that you want to tell us</text><text start="2865.04" dur="5.279">about git coindao governance</text><text start="2867.119" dur="5.2">what are we shooting for uh does it</text><text start="2870.319" dur="4.0">do you all have final thoughts about get</text><text start="2872.319" dur="3.601">coin dial governance and its evolution</text><text start="2874.319" dur="3.76">before we break</text><text start="2875.92" dur="5.28">i actually have a question like on the</text><text start="2878.079" dur="5.361">on the thing that simula just said um</text><text start="2881.2" dur="3.359">on like we are continuously getting this</text><text start="2883.44" dur="3.36">feedback</text><text start="2884.559" dur="4.401">you being here linda as like</text><text start="2886.8" dur="4.24">a steward and not a concrete contributor</text><text start="2888.96" dur="5.04">for bitcoin now because like kyle simona</text><text start="2891.04" dur="4.48">and i are also contributors like</text><text start="2894.0" dur="3.04">what is like the biggest point of</text><text start="2895.52" dur="3.92">feedback that you would give to us right</text><text start="2897.04" dur="3.6">now what what is top of mind like you</text><text start="2899.44" dur="3.44">should get better at this like i&apos;m</text><text start="2900.64" dur="3.84">really curious what comes to mind</text><text start="2902.88" dur="3.92">uh i mean i definitely think you guys</text><text start="2904.48" dur="5.119">are doing a really great job um one</text><text start="2906.8" dur="5.759">thing is that um for me i because i&apos;m</text><text start="2909.599" dur="5.041">not day-to-day operating in these</text><text start="2912.559" dur="4.881">work streams it&apos;s hard for me sometimes</text><text start="2914.64" dur="4.56">to understand the context of uh why</text><text start="2917.44" dur="4.24">things are being done or this new</text><text start="2919.2" dur="5.68">project of um what the goal of this is</text><text start="2921.68" dur="4.639">and so i actually feel like it&apos;s i mean</text><text start="2924.88" dur="2.88">this is how i think about being a</text><text start="2926.319" dur="3.361">steward but i actually don&apos;t think</text><text start="2927.76" dur="4.0">stewards should be reviewing everything</text><text start="2929.68" dur="4.639">i really think that stewards should be</text><text start="2931.76" dur="4.559">focused on their interests and expertise</text><text start="2934.319" dur="4.0">and so actually i know we&apos;re moving</text><text start="2936.319" dur="4.401">towards the structure of getting paired</text><text start="2938.319" dur="3.76">up with other stewards based on like</text><text start="2940.72" dur="4.0">their interests and expertise to</text><text start="2942.079" dur="4.641">actually work with specific uh work</text><text start="2944.72" dur="4.639">streams and so for me i just feel very</text><text start="2946.72" dur="4.399">overwhelmed by a lot because um like i&apos;m</text><text start="2949.359" dur="3.441">not an expert on some of these topics</text><text start="2951.119" dur="2.96">and i&apos;m i&apos;m trying to my best to read</text><text start="2952.8" dur="2.96">through this proposal and i&apos;m like i</text><text start="2954.079" dur="3.361">just have no idea if this is a</text><text start="2955.76" dur="3.04">reasonable amount for what they&apos;re</text><text start="2957.44" dur="2.56">trying to do and</text><text start="2958.8" dur="2.88">what they&apos;re trying to do is that</text><text start="2960.0" dur="3.92">actually something that&apos;s necessary or</text><text start="2961.68" dur="3.2">is it like a nice to have and so i&apos;m</text><text start="2963.92" dur="2.8">just</text><text start="2964.88" dur="3.6">feeling</text><text start="2966.72" dur="3.359">how can we like alleviate the amount of</text><text start="2968.48" dur="2.879">information that people have to process</text><text start="2970.079" dur="3.52">and it&apos;s like a very limited amount of</text><text start="2971.359" dur="3.361">time but otherwise i i do love that</text><text start="2973.599"
