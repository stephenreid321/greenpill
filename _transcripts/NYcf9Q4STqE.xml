Eric is a proud libertarian and we</text><text start="49.44" dur="4.799">talk in this episode about common ground</text><text start="51.899" dur="4.921">not just common ground between different</text><text start="54.239" dur="4.861">political beliefs and how blockchains</text><text start="56.82" dur="3.78">and web3 enable new ways for</text><text start="59.1" dur="4.139">Libertarians to get what they want but</text><text start="60.6" dur="3.9">also lefties to get what they want which</text><text start="63.239" dur="4.681">is the funding of public goods and more</text><text start="64.5" dur="5.04">Pro social types of causes but also</text><text start="67.92" dur="3.96">cooperation across social distance and</text><text start="69.54" dur="4.439">Common

start="76.2" dur="5.94">another Eric has kind of been an elder</text><text start="78.78" dur="5.58">Statesman or uh I guess whatever the</text><text start="82.14" dur="4.86">crypto equivalent of an elder Statesman</text><text start="84.36" dur="5.579">is uh since Eric is pretty anti-statist</text><text start="87.0" dur="4.259">but uh Eric has been sort of across</text><text start="89.939" dur="3.241">different crypto tribes and is well</text><text start="91.259" dur="3.781">respected by the Bitcoin Community the</text><text start="93.18" dur="3.84">ethereum community and many other crypto</text><text start="95.04" dur="3.84">communities as a leader and a Pioneer in</text><text start="97.02" dur="3.48">this space and so I&apos;m just really</text><text start="98.88" dur="3.779">interested in pulling the thread of</text><text start="100.5" dur="4.02">common ground and cooperation across</text><text start="102.659" dur="4.561">social distance not only from crypto</text><text start="104.52" dur="4.62">tribes but also from people who have</text><text start="107.22" dur="3.899">different political philosophies Eric</text><text start="109.14" dur="4.32">being a Libertarian and me being kind of</text><text start="111.119" dur="4.441">like a green Lefty kind of person and so</text><text start="113.46" dur="4.08">this episode is sort of exploring that</text><text start="115.56" dur="3.239">design space of what&apos;s possible when you</text><text start="117.54" dur="2.88">actually have conversations with each</text><text start="118.799" dur="3.6">other and I think that this is a key</text><text start="120.42" dur="4.979">part of building a regenerative crypto</text><text start="122.399" dur="5.101">economic movement the broad Water Tent</text><text start="125.399" dur="5.161">that we can build around using web3 to</text><text start="127.5" dur="4.8">fund public goods the better and if we</text><text start="130.56" dur="4.44">just keep on building messages that</text><text start="132.3" dur="4.439">resonate with people who look like me</text><text start="135.0" dur="4.02">people from Boulder Colorado with like</text><text start="136.739" dur="4.381">long hair and they&apos;re that are that are</text><text start="139.02" dur="4.2">kind of like Lefty then we&apos;re missing an</text><text start="141.12" dur="5.52">important constituency of people who</text><text start="143.22" dur="5.28">care about a Libertarian type ideals and</text><text start="146.64" dur="4.14">in this episode with Eric is kind of an</text><text start="148.5" dur="4.14">olive branch to that community in order</text><text start="150.78" dur="4.319">to figure out the Common Ground between</text><text start="152.64" dur="4.739">the those communities and I think that</text><text start="155.099" dur="3.661">we&apos;re not as stuck as the conversations</text><text start="157.379" dur="3.36">at least in the United States our</text><text start="158.76" dur="3.9">national media feels very stuck like</text><text start="160.739" dur="3.841">there&apos;s gridlock in Washington between</text><text start="162.66" dur="4.439">the left and the right and I think in</text><text start="164.58" dur="4.379">web 3 there&apos;s a lot of opportunity to</text><text start="167.099" dur="3.86">close out the old divisions and to</text><text start="168.959" dur="5.401">create new momentum towards pro-social</text><text start="170.959" dur="5.5">and uh and and pro public goods causes</text><text start="174.36" dur="3.42">and so we kind of Traverse that terrain</text><text start="176.459" dur="3.301">a little bit in this episode with Eric</text><text start="177.78" dur="4.8">it&apos;s a unique episode it&apos;s not like one</text><text start="179.76" dur="4.8">that I&apos;ve done before we&apos;re</text><text start="182.58" dur="4.799">um really good at in some interesting</text><text start="184.56" dur="4.86">conversations here so uh Eric is an idol</text><text start="187.379" dur="3.421">is a legend to me and to many in the</text><text start="189.42" dur="3.179">crypto community

you into</text><text start="326.16" dur="3.479">Bitcoin and and why are you here why are</text><text start="328.199" dur="3.961">you in crypto</text><text start="329.639" dur="5.221">yeah so uh yeah I fell down the rabbit</text><text start="332.16" dur="5.94">hole in May of 2011.</text><text start="334.86" dur="5.76">and um previously I&apos;d been living in in</text><text start="338.1" dur="3.96">Dubai kind of right after college</text><text start="340.62" dur="4.859">um moved there because there was no</text><text start="342.06" dur="4.859">taxes at all and that to me seems</text><text start="345.479" dur="4.56">um like a beautiful sign of good</text><text start="346.919" dur="4.321">civilization so I moved over there and</text><text start="350.039" dur="3.301">um it was during that time that the</text><text start="351.24" dur="5.16">whole Global financial crisis happened</text><text start="353.34" dur="4.62">like 2008-ish</text><text start="356.4" dur="4.079">um and so I got really interested in</text><text start="357.96" dur="6.36">monetary economics how money Works how</text><text start="360.479" dur="5.881">Banks work and uh came to the conclusion</text><text start="364.32" dur="5.4">or at least started thinking that maybe</text><text start="366.36" dur="6.6">the the big issue was that money itself</text><text start="369.72" dur="5.1">was being centrally planned by</text><text start="372.96" dur="4.62">um by a monopoly</text><text start="374.82" dur="5.34">and um that if a market was going to</text><text start="377.58" dur="4.58">function well probably money should be a</text><text start="380.16" dur="5.819">market-based good instead of a</text><text start="382.16" dur="5.14">coercion-based State good and um I just</text><text start="385.979" dur="4.5">really didn&apos;t have like a lot of</text><text start="387.3" dur="4.679">solutions for that I just felt the</text><text start="390.479" dur="2.821">dismay that you know all the world&apos;s</text><text start="391.979" dur="2.94">monies were essentially planned by</text><text start="393.3" dur="4.98">governments</text><text start="394.919" dur="6.241">um I was a fan of gold but realized that</text><text start="398.28" dur="4.979">because it&apos;s it&apos;s physical it has to be</text><text start="401.16" dur="3.72">stored in large you know vaults that are</text><text start="403.259" dur="4.201">secure and so you can never really be</text><text start="404.88" dur="5.22">like outside of the hands of the state</text><text start="407.46" dur="5.78">um and then when I learned about Bitcoin</text><text start="410.1" dur="6.0">I realized that wow actually this is</text><text start="413.24" dur="4.54">this is a possible alternative this is</text><text start="416.1" dur="4.2">like a market-based money that can&apos;t get</text><text start="417.78" dur="4.8">turned off you can send value anyone to</text><text start="420.3" dur="3.66">any to anyone anywhere instantly at</text><text start="422.58" dur="3.239">nearly zero cost</text><text start="423.96" dur="3.239">and just fell in love with the whole</text><text start="425.819" dur="3.301">thing and so</text><text start="427.199" dur="4.921">um obviously it was a long shot that it</text><text start="429.12" dur="5.46">would work out but I I was willing to to</text><text start="432.12" dur="4.98">bet on it and to commit you know all my</text><text start="434.58" dur="3.54">years since then to it so that&apos;s the</text><text start="437.1" dur="3.96">Genesis</text><text start="438.12" dur="4.799">yeah so um</text><text start="441.06" dur="3.479">maybe we could spend a couple minutes on</text><text start="442.919" dur="4.741">the journey since then I know that</text><text start="444.539" dur="5.641">you&apos;ve been involved in founding some</text><text start="447.66" dur="4.86">pretty Innovative products and companies</text><text start="450.18" dur="4.079">in in the crypto space so if you could</text><text start="452.52" dur="3.239">kind of uh Speed Run us through through</text><text start="454.259" dur="3.421">that that&apos;d be great</text><text start="455.759" dur="4.261">yeah uh so</text><text start="457.68" dur="5.459">uh back in 2012</text><text start="460.02" dur="5.06">um I both joined bid instant which was I</text><text start="463.139" dur="4.861">think the first like</text><text start="465.08" dur="4.78">investor-backed company in in Bitcoin um</text><text start="468.0" dur="4.5">so Charlie schrem started that in New</text><text start="469.86" dur="4.38">York and I moved from New Hampshire</text><text start="472.5" dur="3.479">where I was there as part of the free</text><text start="474.24" dur="3.239">state project down to New York to join</text><text start="475.979" dur="3.72">Charlie</text><text start="477.479" dur="4.381">um to build bid instant with him and</text><text start="479.699" dur="3.481">while I was at bid instant well bid</text><text start="481.86" dur="3.899">instant for those who don&apos;t know was a</text><text start="483.18" dur="5.16">way to move money very quickly to mount</text><text start="485.759" dur="3.84">gox to move Fiat money so mountains back</text><text start="488.34" dur="4.139">then was the like really the only</text><text start="489.599" dur="4.38">Bitcoin exchange and it was in Japan and</text><text start="492.479" dur="2.821">so if you wanted to get Fiat there it&apos;d</text><text start="493.979" dur="2.581">be like an international wire that would</text><text start="495.3" dur="2.7">take a week or so</text><text start="496.56" dur="3.359">so we had a way of letting people</text><text start="498.0" dur="3.479">deposit money at various locations in</text><text start="499.919" dur="3.84">the US and we would credit them like</text><text start="501.479" dur="4.861">within a couple hours in with with our</text><text start="503.759" dur="4.921">own money at Mount Cox it was quite cool</text><text start="506.34" dur="4.38">and um</text><text start="508.68" dur="3.779">it was around that time that I started</text><text start="510.72" dur="5.759">uh Satoshi dice</text><text start="512.459" dur="6.901">and that was the world&apos;s most popular</text><text start="516.479" dur="5.221">Bitcoin gambling game it was half of all</text><text start="519.36" dur="6.06">the Bitcoin transactions from Genesis</text><text start="521.7" dur="5.46">block up until sometime in 2013.</text><text start="525.42" dur="4.979">um so it was paying like half the mining</text><text start="527.16" dur="5.88">fees of the whole network for first four</text><text start="530.399" dur="5.221">or five years of bitcoin&apos;s existence and</text><text start="533.04" dur="4.739">it got a little out of control</text><text start="535.62" dur="3.18">um and I ultimately decided to sell it</text><text start="537.779" dur="3.661">because</text><text start="538.8" dur="4.56">I was getting somewhat well known in</text><text start="541.44" dur="4.8">Bitcoin by then and what I care about</text><text start="543.36" dur="4.8">most with Bitcoin is like this the</text><text start="546.24" dur="3.12">change for good that I see that it can</text><text start="548.16" dur="3.9">bring in the world</text><text start="549.36" dur="5.159">so I was um a proponent and advocate of</text><text start="552.06" dur="4.56">it and I recognized that if I was going</text><text start="554.519" dur="3.241">to do that well I probably shouldn&apos;t</text><text start="556.62" dur="3.24">also be running the world&apos;s biggest</text><text start="557.76" dur="5.46">Bitcoin Casino like I kind of need to</text><text start="559.86" dur="5.159">pick a path just for Optics reasons so</text><text start="563.22" dur="3.679">ended up selling Satoshi dice back then</text><text start="565.019" dur="5.041">and um</text><text start="566.899" dur="5.801">after after bit instant and Satoshi dice</text><text start="570.06" dur="5.279">I was in Panama for a year and then um</text><text start="572.7" dur="5.42">after Mount gox collapse started uh</text><text start="575.339" dur="5.281">shape shift so that was back in 2014</text><text start="578.12" dur="4.779">shapeshift started as an exchange for</text><text start="580.62" dur="4.62">people to convert one digital asset like</text><text start="582.899" dur="5.041">Bitcoin into another like Litecoin this</text><text start="585.24" dur="5.719">was pre-etherium and um it did it</text><text start="587.94" dur="5.519">without custody so the the mount Cox</text><text start="590.959" dur="4.721">catastrophe weighed on me and almost</text><text start="593.459" dur="5.101">destroyed the industry and shapeshift</text><text start="595.68" dur="4.74">was an intent um to build an exchange</text><text start="598.56" dur="5.219">for digital assets that did not require</text><text start="600.42" dur="5.76">custody and um that had its whole story</text><text start="603.779" dur="4.081">over the last eight or nine years and</text><text start="606.18" dur="2.64">that&apos;s been um that&apos;s been my history</text><text start="607.86" dur="3.96">with it</text><text start="608.82" dur="5.28">yeah I I just think that the idea of a</text><text start="611.82" dur="4.019">non-custodialist exchange is so</text><text start="614.1" dur="3.48">groundbreaking and it&apos;s maybe something</text><text start="615.839" dur="3.781">we take for granted I do a trade on</text><text start="617.58" dur="3.96">uniswap or on the new version of</text><text start="619.62" dur="4.2">shapeshift and the assets leave my</text><text start="621.54" dur="4.26">wallet and there&apos;s some magic that</text><text start="623.82" dur="3.78">happens and then the new assets come</text><text start="625.8" dur="4.02">into my wallet but the State of the</text><text start="627.6" dur="4.739">State at that time was not doing</text><text start="629.82" dur="4.68">non-custodial transfers and I think did</text><text start="632.339" dur="4.141">you all did you all pioneer that</text><text start="634.5" dur="4.08">yeah I think we were the first ones to</text><text start="636.48" dur="3.84">do a non-custodial exchange</text><text start="638.58" dur="3.48">um obviously it couldn&apos;t work with Fiat</text><text start="640.32" dur="3.98">and so that was one of my decisions back</text><text start="642.06" dur="6.839">then was like all the exchanges were</text><text start="644.3" dur="7.18">Fiat exchanges Fiat to bitcoin and I you</text><text start="648.899" dur="5.641">know Bitcoin was like 95 or 98 of the</text><text start="651.48" dur="4.02">market cap of All Digital assets so</text><text start="654.54" dur="3.239">um people thought it was a little</text><text start="655.5" dur="4.44">strange to do an exchange just for</text><text start="657.779" dur="4.5">digital assets like like that was two</text><text start="659.94" dur="3.839">niche but I saw where the world was</text><text start="662.279" dur="4.321">going obviously there was going to be</text><text start="663.779" dur="4.381">lots of digital assets and um so yeah I</text><text start="666.6" dur="4.02">think it was the first it was obviously</text><text start="668.16" dur="4.5">before smart contracts so the way it</text><text start="670.62" dur="4.2">worked is that like it operated much</text><text start="672.66" dur="3.96">like a vending machine so someone would</text><text start="674.82" dur="5.4">send Bitcoin the Bitcoin would go to our</text><text start="676.62" dur="5.58">wallet so we had a moment of custody</text><text start="680.22" dur="4.14">and then we would send</text><text start="682.2" dur="3.54">um you know the Litecoin out to the user</text><text start="684.36" dur="4.32">moments later</text><text start="685.74" dur="4.92">so um people had to trust us only for</text><text start="688.68" dur="3.48">the moment of the trade instead of the</text><text start="690.66" dur="3.66">entire period of you know where their</text><text start="692.16" dur="4.2">funds were being held which just you</text><text start="694.32" dur="5.459">know reduced by three orders of</text><text start="696.36" dur="5.34">magnitude the risk to the user right and</text><text start="699.779" dur="3.481">we didn&apos;t we also because we cared about</text><text start="701.7" dur="3.42">protecting people we also didn&apos;t take</text><text start="703.26" dur="4.8">their personal information so we had no</text><text start="705.12" dur="5.219">kyc and um that became very</text><text start="708.06" dur="4.44">controversial but it was something that</text><text start="710.339" dur="3.961">was important to me because</text><text start="712.5" dur="4.14">um yeah if someone&apos;s not even accused of</text><text start="714.3" dur="4.86">a crime I shouldn&apos;t have to take their</text><text start="716.64" dur="5.04">personal information period</text><text start="719.16" dur="4.679">right well I mean you know one of the</text><text start="721.68" dur="4.74">things that so I mean I think a thread</text><text start="723.839" dur="6.06">for this episode for me is cooperation</text><text start="726.42" dur="4.68">across social distance and you know one</text><text start="729.899" dur="2.821">of the major arcs that I want to get</text><text start="731.1" dur="4.08">into in this episode is like your sort</text><text start="732.72" dur="4.739">of libertarian values in my more leftist</text><text start="735.18" dur="3.899">values but but before we get into that I</text><text start="737.459" dur="3.961">just want to know the cooperation across</text><text start="739.079" dur="5.041">social distance that happens with</text><text start="741.42" dur="5.76">shapeshift because shape because crypto</text><text start="744.12" dur="4.98">is inherently tribal industry as anyone</text><text start="747.18" dur="5.339">who spent any time on crypto Twitter</text><text start="749.1" dur="6.12">knows there is people from coin a that</text><text start="752.519" dur="5.101">talk about how coin B is a [ __ ] coin and</text><text start="755.22" dur="5.04">vice versa and there&apos;s these narrative</text><text start="757.62" dur="4.44">battles for the future of digital assets</text><text start="760.26" dur="5.28">and one of the things that has always</text><text start="762.06" dur="5.279">attracted me to you as a thinker and the</text><text start="765.54" dur="4.16">philosopher and executor in the space is</text><text start="767.339" dur="5.221">that you&apos;re very pluralistic about</text><text start="769.7" dur="5.92">assets and and I don&apos;t know which came</text><text start="772.56" dur="5.76">first sort of that philosophy</text><text start="775.62" dur="4.86">um or shape-shift a business that was</text><text start="778.32" dur="3.9">built on that philosophy a fee but I&apos;ve</text><text start="780.48" dur="4.859">always just appreciated that you&apos;ll</text><text start="782.22" dur="5.94">stand up to maximalists of of all</text><text start="785.339" dur="3.961">different crypto tribes and</text><text start="788.16" dur="3.239">um you&apos;re kind of a Nexus for</text><text start="789.3" dur="3.719">cooperation across social distance in</text><text start="791.399" dur="3.601">the crypto industry because you&apos;re above</text><text start="793.019" dur="3.421">any specific asset I don&apos;t know if you</text><text start="795.0" dur="4.32">have anything to say about that thanks</text><text start="796.44" dur="5.16">yeah I appreciate you saying that um</text><text start="799.32" dur="5.1">yeah I mean it comes from my interest in</text><text start="801.6" dur="5.34">all of this which which was based on</text><text start="804.42" dur="5.099">principle like I am in this space</text><text start="806.94" dur="5.22">because of principle because of the</text><text

happen</text><text start="817.139" dur="4.561">better I am in favor of so I fell in</text><text start="820.32" dur="3.42">love with Bitcoin because it was the</text><text start="821.7" dur="3.66">first plausible tool that actually</text><text start="823.74" dur="3.12">enabled that</text><text start="825.36" dur="3.0">um I&apos;ve fallen in love with ethereum</text><text start="826.86" dur="3.779">because it can do things the Bitcoin</text><text start="828.36" dur="4.5">can&apos;t do and it works differently and in</text><text start="830.639" dur="4.32">different beautiful ways I love the</text><text start="832.86" dur="3.539">Privacy coins like Monero and Z cash</text><text start="834.959" dur="4.44">because they actually let people be</text><text start="836.399" dur="4.56">anonymous and I love seeing just all the</text><text start="839.399" dur="3.361">Innovation that is happening because</text><text start="840.959" dur="3.661">people are truly building like a</text><text start="842.76" dur="4.56">decentralized financial system</text><text start="844.62" dur="4.32">and if you value decentralization how</text><text start="847.32" dur="3.36">can you not appreciate multiple</text><text start="848.94" dur="3.899">blockchains being built in different</text><text start="850.68" dur="4.68">ways by different teams with different</text><text start="852.839" dur="4.74">assumptions many of which will fail</text><text start="855.36" dur="3.719">obviously most tokens are totally stupid</text><text start="857.579" dur="3.901">and most projects are going to fall</text><text start="859.079" dur="4.981">apart that&apos;s just part of how Innovation</text><text start="861.48" dur="5.039">Works that&apos;s not unique to crypto but to</text><text start="864.06" dur="4.5">be wedded to um any specific asset</text><text start="866.519" dur="4.26">instead of the principles I think is</text><text start="868.56" dur="4.5">really missing the point and it&apos;s always</text><text start="870.779" dur="4.8">bothered me to see these tribalists they</text><text start="873.06" dur="4.74">spend more time arguing between Bitcoin</text><text start="875.579" dur="4.141">or ethereum instead of realizing that</text><text start="877.8" dur="3.899">like these two systems are complementary</text><text start="879.72" dur="5.66">like they rise and they fall together</text><text start="881.699" dur="6.541">they are not eating each other&apos;s lunch</text><text start="885.38" dur="5.319">they help and enable each other I I love</text><text start="888.24" dur="4.62">that Bitcoin has remained proof of work</text><text start="890.699" dur="5.101">and I love that ethereum has moved to</text><text start="892.86" dur="5.159">proof of stake I think the the</text><text start="895.8" dur="4.08">diversity of those two consensus</text><text start="898.019" dur="4.021">mechanisms is part of the strength of</text><text start="899.88" dur="3.42">this ecosystem because each has pros and</text><text start="902.04" dur="3.06">cons</text><text start="903.3" dur="3.599">um and I just see these as like you know</text><text start="905.1" dur="4.08">mutually beneficial things and I wish</text><text start="906.899" dur="3.721">people would stop fighting among</text><text start="909.18" dur="4.019">themselves and realize that the actual</text><text start="910.62" dur="4.38">the actual enemy are the banks and the</text><text start="913.199" dur="5.88">government&apos;s uh the Fiat Financial</text><text start="915.0" dur="7.079">system not other open source Developers</text><text start="919.079" dur="4.801">I&apos;d love to to pull that thread</text><text start="922.079" dur="3.841">um just knowing what the Arc of this</text><text start="923.88" dur="3.18">episode is uh I&apos;m wondering if you can</text><text start="925.92" dur="3.719">talk about</text><text start="927.06" dur="4.68">why the banks in the government are the</text><text start="929.639" dur="4.56">enemy I wonder if you can talk about why</text><text start="931.74" dur="4.86">coercion at the foundation of state</text><text start="934.199" dur="5.521">power is a bad thing just sort of those</text><text start="936.6" dur="4.56">principles that you&apos;ve been adhering to</text><text start="939.72" dur="3.54">since the start of getting into the</text><text start="941.16" dur="4.14">crypto space I&apos;m wondering if we can if</text><text start="943.26" dur="3.78">we can dive into those for a few minutes</text><text start="945.3" dur="3.779">yeah</text><text start="947.04" dur="4.2">um so</text><text start="949.079" dur="4.2">yeah fundamentally everyone has to make</text><text start="951.24" dur="4.26">some assumptions on how the world should</text><text start="953.279" dur="3.781">work and they have to make some moral</text><text start="955.5" dur="2.94">and ethical assumptions and then build a</text><text start="957.06" dur="5.339">world view around it</text><text start="958.44" dur="7.86">and um my assumption is is simple or my</text><text start="962.399" dur="5.521">my premises which is just that uh it is</text><text start="966.3" dur="3.18">better when humans are peaceful with</text><text start="967.92" dur="3.659">each other</text><text start="969.48" dur="3.84">that uh we should respect each other as</text><text start="971.579" dur="2.88">individuals we should not cause each</text><text start="973.32" dur="4.019">other harm</text><text start="974.459" dur="5.281">I shouldn&apos;t hurt you you shouldn&apos;t hurt</text><text start="977.339" dur="3.18">me I shouldn&apos;t steal your stuff</text><text start="979.74" dur="3.36">um</text><text start="980.519" dur="4.981">and you know I shouldn&apos;t commit fraud</text><text start="983.1" dur="4.979">against you like these kind of very</text><text start="985.5" dur="4.079">basic things that 99.9 of people agree</text><text start="988.079" dur="2.101">with</text><text start="989.579" dur="3.421">um</text><text start="990.18" dur="4.92">that&apos;s the the fundamental essence of my</text><text start="993.0" dur="4.32">whole philosophy and everything else all</text><text start="995.1" dur="4.26">the other details are just sort of a</text><text start="997.32" dur="3.959">logical extension of that you know why</text><text start="999.36" dur="3.96">am I anti-taxation because you&apos;re</text><text start="1001.279" dur="4.141">stealing from people and we can discuss</text><text start="1003.32" dur="3.68">you know why I Define it in that way but</text><text start="1005.42" dur="5.4">it comes from that principle of</text><text start="1007.0" dur="6.94">respecting your fellow man and um</text><text start="1010.82" dur="5.819">and not harming them so um yeah that&apos;s</text><text start="1013.94" dur="4.62">that&apos;s why I think that a money system</text><text start="1016.639" dur="3.961">needs to maintain Fidelity to that</text><text start="1018.56" dur="5.399">principle if you have a fiat currency</text><text start="1020.6" dur="6.839">system where coercive laws from the</text><text start="1023.959" dur="5.941">government are not quite forcing people</text><text start="1027.439" dur="4.681">to use and hold but certainly legally</text><text start="1029.9" dur="4.62">encouraging people to use a financial</text><text start="1032.12" dur="4.92">system that is debased</text><text start="1034.52" dur="4.02">um I find that to be highly unethical I</text><text start="1037.04" dur="4.2">mean it&apos;s essentially</text><text start="1038.54" dur="5.879">the world is close to force to being</text><text start="1041.24" dur="5.16">used fiat currency and then certain</text><text start="1044.419" dur="4.26">people with certain privileges are able</text><text start="1046.4" dur="4.92">to print as much of that stuff as they</text><text start="1048.679" dur="4.38">want they get the benefits before the</text><text start="1051.32" dur="4.02">price levels in the economy generally</text><text start="1053.059" dur="4.74">rise and everyone that holds the asset</text><text start="1055.34" dur="5.64">and works for the asset largely the the</text><text start="1057.799" dur="6.061">poorest uh and least educated among the</text><text start="1060.98" dur="5.16">world are the ones that suffer from that</text><text start="1063.86" dur="3.48">currency debasement I think it&apos;s one of</text><text start="1066.14" dur="3.32">the worst</text><text start="1067.34" dur="5.82">scams frauds</text><text start="1069.46" dur="5.5">injustices of the world and so when I</text><text start="1073.16" dur="3.48">see Bitcoin and I see a system that is</text><text start="1074.96" dur="3.54">open immutable and that everyone can</text><text start="1076.64" dur="3.24">access with the exact same rules in the</text><text start="1078.5" dur="2.7">same way</text><text start="1079.88" dur="3.78">um no one&apos;s forced to use it it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1081.2" dur="4.74">have any special legal privileges it is</text><text start="1083.66" dur="3.84">purely a money of the market</text><text start="1085.94" dur="2.94">um to me that is where the virtue of</text><text start="1087.5" dur="2.7">these things come from and that&apos;s true</text><text start="1088.88" dur="3.419">whether we&apos;re talking about Bitcoin or</text><text start="1090.2" dur="4.8">ethereum</text><text start="1092.299" dur="5.461">so one of the arguments that I heard in</text><text start="1095.0" dur="4.74">there was this argument against against</text><text start="1097.76" dur="4.62">theft and and I think that there&apos;s</text><text start="1099.74" dur="5.28">there&apos;s sort of two examples of how Fiat</text><text start="1102.38" dur="5.7">money enables theft one is taxation is</text><text start="1105.02" dur="5.94">theft uh because people didn&apos;t consent</text><text start="1108.08" dur="5.76">to being taxed taxed and then the second</text><text start="1110.96" dur="4.92">is debasement of the currency which</text><text start="1113.84" dur="3.78">creates inflation of the currency is</text><text start="1115.88" dur="3.72">theft and those to me feel like</text><text start="1117.62" dur="3.72">arguments from first principles I did</text><text start="1119.6" dur="4.14">not consent to my monetary system being</text><text start="1121.34" dur="3.839">debased or me being taxed so therefore</text><text start="1123.74" dur="3.48">is theft that feels like a first</text><text start="1125.179" dur="4.981">principle&apos;s argument to me but I also</text><text start="1127.22" dur="6.6">heard a causal argument in there that</text><text start="1130.16" dur="4.86">feels very pro-social to me and as a as</text><text start="1133.82" dur="3.479">like kind of a lefty I&apos;m really</text><text start="1135.02" dur="4.019">interested in that as well because you</text><text start="1137.299" dur="4.021">said that the people who are debasing</text><text start="1139.039" dur="6.781">the currency get the benefits of that</text><text start="1141.32" dur="6.239">new currency before the poor uh in in</text><text start="1145.82" dur="4.56">that feels like an economic justice</text><text start="1147.559" dur="6.301">social justice causal argument</text><text start="1150.38" dur="6.419">um against those things and</text><text start="1153.86" dur="3.72">and and and and and so</text><text start="1156.799" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="1157.58" dur="4.26">I I I just think it it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1159.799" dur="2.76">interesting to think that</text><text start="1161.84" dur="3.18">um</text><text start="1162.559" dur="4.021">there&apos;s kind of like a I I don&apos;t see it</text><text start="1165.02" dur="4.44">often in the media but there&apos;s a there&apos;s</text><text start="1166.58" dur="5.28">kind of like a social justice argument</text><text start="1169.46" dur="4.079">um against fiat currency in there and</text><text start="1171.86" dur="3.179">and I don&apos;t think that I&apos;ve ever heard</text><text start="1173.539" dur="3.061">that from you or other Libertarians</text><text start="1175.039" dur="2.461">before maybe I just wasn&apos;t listening for</text><text start="1176.6" dur="3.12">it</text><text start="1177.5" dur="5.22">yo uh well people on the left love to</text><text start="1179.72" dur="4.74">use this word access like people have</text><text start="1182.72" dur="4.319">people should have access to health care</text><text start="1184.46" dur="4.98">or access to birth control</text><text start="1187.039" dur="4.38">um often access is used as a euphemism</text><text start="1189.44" dur="4.56">just to cover up the fact that it&apos;s an</text><text start="1191.419" dur="3.841">issue of poverty that like everyone has</text><text start="1194.0" dur="3.419">access to health care it&apos;s just a</text><text start="1195.26" dur="5.22">question of whether you can afford it</text><text start="1197.419" dur="6.301">um so it&apos;s but that word access is used</text><text start="1200.48" dur="5.699">I think because people like like the</text><text start="1203.72" dur="5.52">idea that something is available</text><text start="1206.179" dur="5.341">um sort of equally across all people and</text><text start="1209.24" dur="4.38">and it&apos;s interesting when those that are</text><text start="1211.52" dur="4.44">not part of the crypto world don&apos;t apply</text><text start="1213.62" dur="4.26">that to the money system itself</text><text start="1215.96" dur="3.78">right so if we&apos;re talking about the</text><text start="1217.88" dur="5.4">value of equal access to something and</text><text start="1219.74" dur="5.4">we want to literally use the term access</text><text start="1223.28" dur="4.62">um none of us have equal access to the</text><text start="1225.14" dur="4.38">Fiat Financial system if you&apos;re a bank</text><text start="1227.9" dur="4.139">with a banking license you have</text><text start="1229.52" dur="4.8">privileges over that system to create</text><text start="1232.039" dur="3.841">money literally out of thin air like</text><text start="1234.32" dur="2.64">when a bank creates a loan for your</text><text start="1235.88" dur="2.76">mortgage</text><text start="1236.96" dur="4.38">most people don&apos;t realize this but they</text><text start="1238.64" dur="4.62">make the money at the bank when you get</text><text start="1241.34" dur="4.14">the loan</text><text start="1243.26" dur="3.419">um it&apos;s like just counterfeiting money</text><text start="1245.48" dur="3.0">but because they have a special license</text><text start="1246.679" dur="3.301">from the state they get to do that if</text><text start="1248.48" dur="2.22">you did that or if I did that we&apos;d go to</text><text start="1249.98" dur="2.699">jail</text><text start="1250.7" dur="4.2">similarly the Central Bank obviously has</text><text start="1252.679" dur="5.601">even greater Powers than that</text><text start="1254.9" dur="6.18">um similarly you and I can&apos;t like access</text><text start="1258.28" dur="4.72">uh the flows of money in the Fiat</text><text start="1261.08" dur="4.2">Financial system we can&apos;t pull it up on</text><text start="1263.0" dur="4.38">an open blockchain and view all the</text><text start="1265.28" dur="3.72">money moving around the world right we</text><text start="1267.38"

can&apos;t access the</text><text start="1274.28" dur="5.16">information behind it and</text><text start="1276.86" dur="5.46">um this creates a huge disparity between</text><text start="1279.44" dur="3.96">people who otherwise should be treated</text><text start="1282.32" dur="3.66">equally</text><text start="1283.4" dur="3.54">and um what&apos;s so cool about crypto is</text><text start="1285.98" dur="3.54">that</text><text start="1286.94" dur="5.099">it didn&apos;t require anyone to like</text><text start="1289.52" dur="4.2">vote in the old system to approve it</text><text start="1292.039" dur="3.901">it&apos;s just this alternative system that&apos;s</text><text start="1293.72" dur="4.439">sitting there usable by anyone who opens</text><text start="1295.94" dur="4.44">their eyes to it and everyone has equal</text><text start="1298.159" dur="3.9">access to it and not just everyone in</text><text start="1300.38" dur="4.08">America but like the entire world</text><text start="1302.059" dur="3.6">doesn&apos;t matter what color your skin is</text><text start="1304.46" dur="2.219">it doesn&apos;t matter how much money you</text><text start="1305.659"

dur="4.8">objective rule set as everyone else</text><text start="1317.179" dur="4.98">and to me like that is that is true</text><text start="1319.52" dur="4.5">equality and absolutely something that I</text><text start="1322.159" dur="3.961">think the the Libertarians and the</text><text start="1324.02" dur="4.94">leftists within the crypto Community</text><text start="1326.12" dur="2.84">should align on</text><text start="1329.419" dur="2.64">um I just want to kind of check on that</text><text start="1330.799" dur="2.461">framing a little bit because I know that</text><text start="1332.059" dur="3.901">you and I did a panel at East Denver</text><text start="1333.26" dur="4.74">last year about 11 months ago and David</text><text start="1335.96" dur="3.599">Hoffman was moderating it and I think</text><text start="1338.0" dur="3.299">that he kind of presented me as the</text><text start="1339.559" dur="4.201">leftist at the table and you as the</text><text start="1341.299" dur="5.401">libertarian at the table and that might</text><text start="1343.76" dur="4.62">be too reductionist because I think that</text><text start="1346.7" dur="4.14">um I have a superposition of beliefs</text><text start="1348.38" dur="4.38">across the political Spectrum I just</text><text start="1350.84" dur="3.6">happen to have long hair and talk about</text><text start="1352.76" dur="3.6">public goods a lot so maybe people code</text><text start="1354.44" dur="4.14">me on the left and and I guess I&apos;m</text><text start="1356.36" dur="3.66">asking like is coding is coding you on</text><text start="1358.58" dur="3.0">the political Spectrum as a Libertarian</text><text start="1360.02" dur="4.32">true reductionist</text><text start="1361.58" dur="5.4">no I&apos;m absolutely a Libertarian uh in a</text><text start="1364.34" dur="5.459">very extreme one so I happily Embrace</text><text start="1366.98" dur="5.88">that label I can Define what it means I</text><text start="1369.799" dur="4.441">think interestingly it&apos;s very</text><text start="1372.86" dur="3.9">I think a lot of people on the left or</text><text start="1374.24" dur="3.96">the right often if you ask them like</text><text start="1376.76" dur="3.12">what it means to be on the left to the</text><text start="1378.2" dur="3.54">right they they don&apos;t quite have a</text><text start="1379.88" dur="3.299">consistent answer</text><text start="1381.74" dur="3.96">um and it&apos;s interesting to watch people</text><text start="1383.179" dur="5.041">on both sides of that Spectrum take</text><text start="1385.7" dur="5.64">conflicting views that don&apos;t actually</text><text start="1388.22" dur="4.74">adhere to a single principle yeah um my</text><text start="1391.34" dur="3.12">principle is just as I mentioned before</text><text start="1392.96" dur="3.839">that people should be peaceful with one</text><text start="1394.46" dur="4.26">another and everything everything that I</text><text start="1396.799" dur="4.62">believe comes down to is sort of trying</text><text start="1398.72" dur="5.52">to fit it to that</text><text start="1401.419" dur="5.161">I&apos;m wondering if we can talk about as</text><text start="1404.24" dur="3.9">far as I I&apos;ve read some libertarian</text><text start="1406.58" dur="4.26">philosophy and it feels like this idea</text><text start="1408.14" dur="5.64">that taxation is theft is rooted on this</text><text start="1410.84" dur="5.699">idea that the government has a monopoly</text><text start="1413.78" dur="5.16">on violence so basically the implication</text><text start="1416.539" dur="5.161">of that is if you do not pay your taxes</text><text start="1418.94" dur="6.119">then you&apos;ll be thrown in jail uh and</text><text start="1421.7" dur="4.62">guns will be pointed at you and and I&apos;m</text><text start="1425.059" dur="5.461">wondering if you can talk a little bit</text><text start="1426.32" dur="6.96">about the Monopoly on on violence and um</text><text start="1430.52" dur="5.279">is that at the root of the sort of</text><text start="1433.28" dur="5.519">libertarian</text><text start="1435.799" dur="5.221">um problem with with government is is</text><text start="1438.799" dur="5.221">that basically</text><text start="1441.02" dur="5.279">um the Monopoly on violence is is a</text><text start="1444.02" dur="5.1">violation of that principle that people</text><text start="1446.299" dur="4.561">should be peaceful with each other</text><text start="1449.12" dur="3.36">yeah and that you know sort of all</text><text start="1450.86" dur="3.54">violence is a violation of that</text><text start="1452.48" dur="4.679">principle sometimes violence can be</text><text start="1454.4" dur="5.46">justified so I&apos;m not a pacifist in that</text><text start="1457.159" dur="5.76">regard but um the bar should be very</text><text start="1459.86" dur="5.28">high to justify violence and I think one</text><text start="1462.919" dur="4.861">thing that might help people is</text><text start="1465.14" dur="4.62">Society is very large and complex and</text><text start="1467.78" dur="4.56">people kind of are born into it with all</text><text start="1469.76" dur="3.48">these understandings and and memes and</text><text start="1472.34" dur="4.5">norms</text><text start="1473.24" dur="6.299">and if you actually just reduce the</text><text start="1476.84" dur="5.4">the space of consideration to a smaller</text><text start="1479.539" dur="4.861">set you can see these principles very</text><text start="1482.24" dur="4.38">easily so take for example like a</text><text start="1484.4" dur="4.08">society of or like a you know a desert</text><text start="1486.62" dur="3.539">island of 10 people</text><text start="1488.48" dur="3.36">and they all find themselves there no</text><text start="1490.159" dur="3.061">help is coming and they&apos;re all just like</text><text start="1491.84" dur="3.3">trying to survive in the wilderness on</text><text start="1493.22" dur="3.54">the island</text><text start="1495.14" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="1496.76" dur="3.659">I think most people would agree that</text><text start="1498.38" dur="3.12">none of those people should like harm</text><text start="1500.419" dur="2.341">each other</text><text start="1501.5" dur="2.28">right like that should be a good</text><text start="1502.76" dur="4.08">principle</text><text start="1503.78" dur="6.48">and um if</text><text start="1506.84" dur="4.8">if six of the people uh all raised their</text><text start="1510.26" dur="4.26">hands and voted</text><text start="1511.64" dur="4.56">for those six people to rule the four</text><text start="1514.52" dur="4.139">I think most people would have a problem</text><text start="1516.2" dur="5.04">with that they&apos;d be like well hold on a</text><text start="1518.659" dur="4.621">second why do the six of you get to rule</text><text start="1521.24" dur="4.559">the four but that&apos;s just that&apos;s</text><text start="1523.28" dur="4.259">democracy so I&apos;m also not a fan of</text><text start="1525.799" dur="4.441">democracy as a principle</text><text start="1527.539" dur="4.74">and um I think when you when you take</text><text start="1530.24" dur="4.14">that set of 10 people on the island</text><text start="1532.279" dur="3.841">most people are like especially if you</text><text start="1534.38" dur="3.48">cast it like um with with men and women</text><text start="1536.12" dur="3.0">that it becomes even more visceral you</text><text start="1537.86" dur="3.299">know let&apos;s say there&apos;s four women and</text><text start="1539.12" dur="4.32">six men</text><text start="1541.159" dur="3.841">um to what degree do those six men have</text><text start="1543.44" dur="3.479">the right to do whatever they want to</text><text start="1545.0" dur="2.82">the women just because they outnumber</text><text start="1546.919" dur="2.941">them</text><text start="1547.82" dur="3.479">right I think they don&apos;t have any right</text><text start="1549.86" dur="3.0">to do anything to the women the women</text><text start="1551.299" dur="4.021">are individuals and it doesn&apos;t matter if</text><text start="1552.86" dur="4.26">it&apos;s six men or a hundred men like the</text><text start="1555.32" dur="3.9">women should be respected as individual</text><text start="1557.12" dur="4.62">people it doesn&apos;t matter if a vote is</text><text start="1559.22" dur="4.02">taken to violate them</text><text start="1561.74" dur="3.179">um and to me that seems obvious on the</text><text start="1563.24" dur="4.62">example of the desert island but somehow</text><text start="1564.919" dur="5.76">when you expand it from 10 people to 350</text><text start="1567.86" dur="4.319">million uh most throw that idea out the</text><text start="1570.679" dur="3.841">window and they think anything that is</text><text start="1572.179" dur="4.561">democratically voted is fine</text><text start="1574.52" dur="4.259">and um that&apos;s I think where a lot of the</text><text start="1576.74" dur="4.38">the conflict comes from</text><text start="1578.779" dur="5.821">so what is the um</text><text start="1581.12" dur="5.7">is there is there sort of like is this</text><text start="1584.6" dur="5.76">idea in um</text><text start="1586.82" dur="5.7">neoliberal neoliberal philosophy or an</text><text start="1590.36" dur="4.74">argument that&apos;s put forth uh that&apos;s</text><text start="1592.52" dur="5.22">abbreviated as Tina there is no</text><text start="1595.1" dur="4.74">alternative and you know I I guess</text><text start="1597.74" dur="6.12">that&apos;s that&apos;s my question for you is is</text><text start="1599.84" dur="6.54">is there an agarist uh alternative to</text><text start="1603.86" dur="4.14">civilization at scale</text><text start="1606.38" dur="4.32">um algorithm being a social philosophy</text><text start="1608.0" dur="4.679">and creating a relation uh a society in</text><text start="1610.7" dur="4.92">which all relations are voluntary</text><text start="1612.679" dur="4.441">exchanges without the state uh sort of</text><text start="1615.62" dur="5.1">forcing anyone to do anything like is is</text><text start="1617.12" dur="6.24">there a counter factual version of of</text><text start="1620.72" dur="5.4">the United States or the world or</text><text start="1623.36" dur="6.0">Colorado that is more agarist that is</text><text start="1626.12" dur="6.72">there a social philosophy that</text><text start="1629.36" dur="4.86">that has scaled that that looks more in</text><text start="1632.84" dur="3.78">in that vein</text><text start="1634.22" dur="4.439">is a good question and I think before</text><text start="1636.62" dur="3.24">addressing that question it&apos;s important</text><text start="1638.659" dur="3.241">to</text><text start="1639.86" dur="4.699">at least like agree on the moral</text><text start="1641.9" dur="5.759">principles before talking about the</text><text start="1644.559" dur="4.6">empirical results</text><text start="1647.659" dur="4.441">um because I think it&apos;d be reasonable</text><text start="1649.159" dur="4.681">for people to say look I agree that</text><text start="1652.1" dur="3.66">um the sick should not be able to vote</text><text start="1653.84" dur="5.28">on whatever they want and harm the four</text><text start="1655.76" dur="6.38">I agree that that&apos;s morally correct</text><text start="1659.12" dur="5.82">but they must do it for X Y and Z</text><text start="1662.14" dur="3.7">practical reason or empirical reason or</text><text start="1664.94" dur="2.4">whatever</text><text start="1665.84" dur="4.14">um that&apos;s at least an intellectually</text><text start="1667.34" dur="3.48">honest way to proceed</text><text start="1669.98" dur="2.34">um</text><text start="1670.82" dur="2.7">so I think if you&apos;re looking at like</text><text start="1672.32" dur="2.82">what are the what are the consequences</text><text start="1673.52" dur="2.94">and what are the Alternatives there&apos;s</text><text start="1675.14" dur="3.899">all sorts of counter factuals and</text><text start="1676.46" dur="4.38">there&apos;s also examples of like the</text><text start="1679.039" dur="4.081">efficacy of larger governments for</text><text start="1680.84" dur="4.079">smaller governments so you can see this</text><text start="1683.12" dur="4.559">all over the world like to use the the</text><text start="1684.919" dur="5.821">US for example U.S has a much larger</text><text start="1687.679" dur="5.041">government today than it than it used to</text><text start="1690.74" dur="3.96">um the entire industrial revolution of</text><text start="1692.72" dur="3.66">America and its period of fastest growth</text><text start="1694.7" dur="3.839">and greatest wealth creation happened in</text><text start="1696.38" dur="3.72">the 19th century specifically in the</text><text start="1698.539" dur="3.601">latter part of the 19th century after</text><text start="1700.1" dur="3.72">slavery was abolished</text><text start="1702.14" dur="3.539">and um</text><text start="1703.82" dur="4.32">that happened without any income tax</text><text start="1705.679" dur="4.081">that happened with a small</text><text start="1708.14" dur="3.419">national government</text><text start="1709.76" dur="3.299">it happened with very little</text><text start="1711.559" dur="3.24">interference from government into the</text><text start="1713.059" dur="4.141">lives of ordinary individuals</text><text start="1714.799" dur="4.201">and um there&apos;s examples throughout the</text><text start="1717.2" dur="5.339">world right like Hong Kong versus China</text><text start="1719.0" dur="5.82">or South Korea versus North Korea</text><text start="1722.539" dur="4.74">um you know Switzerland versus other</text><text start="1724.82" dur="4.38">countries in in Europe generally when</text><text start="1727.279" dur="5.4">you have people permitted Freedom</text><text start="1729.2" dur="5.339">societies tend to thrive</text><text start="1732.679" dur="4.441">um more than those societies which</text><text start="1734.539" dur="5.101">resort to central control and violence</text><text start="1737.12" dur="5.7">of things there&apos;s obviously counter</text><text start="1739.64" dur="4.5">examples that that work against that but</text><text start="1742.82" dur="3.3">as a general Trend throughout history</text><text start="1744.14" dur="4.38">and across the world I I feel like</text><text start="1746.12" dur="4.62">that&apos;s fairly apparent and so from my</text><text start="1748.52" dur="4.74">perspective both the moral argument and</text><text start="1750.74" dur="4.26">the empirical argument toward respecting</text><text start="1753.26" dur="4.5">individuals</text><text start="1755.0" dur="4.88">um as sacred I think is is a compelling</text><text start="1757.76" dur="2.12">one</text><text start="1760.399" dur="4.621">yeah I I I think that that&apos;s interesting</text><text start="1763.399" dur="3.961">I</text><text start="1765.02" dur="5.46">the engineering me wants to have like a</text><text start="1767.36" dur="4.5">little bit more of like case studies on</text><text start="1770.48" dur="3.54">both sides and then we can maybe pull</text><text start="1771.86" dur="4.02">apart the um</text><text start="1774.02" dur="4.379">the different attributes of them and</text><text start="1775.88" dur="4.159">what caused the societies to grow but</text><text start="1778.399" dur="4.081">you know what comes to mind for me is</text><text start="1780.039" dur="3.88">can we click on that for a second</text><text start="1782.48" dur="3.6">because like if we go back to the island</text><text start="1783.919" dur="4.62">with the 10 people and the four women</text><text start="1786.08" dur="5.339">yeah I mean imagine the the engineer</text><text start="1788.539" dur="6.301">among them right a male of course who is</text><text start="1791.419" dur="5.76">saying well if the women do not comply</text><text start="1794.84" dur="5.339">like we won&apos;t be able to have babies and</text><text start="1797.179" dur="5.281">the society will die out thus we have</text><text start="1800.179" dur="4.201">justification to rape the women</text><text start="1802.46" dur="3.719">right like that&apos;s that&apos;s an engineer</text><text start="1804.38" dur="3.659">that&apos;s from an engineering perspective</text><text start="1806.179" dur="3.781">that&apos;s correct</text><text start="1808.039" dur="4.801">um and yet good people should feel kind</text><text start="1809.96" dur="5.4">of disgusted by that so yeah the problem</text><text start="1812.84" dur="4.92">with with these societies is when people</text><text start="1815.36" dur="3.539">decide like I want to engineer how</text><text start="1817.76" dur="3.24">others live</text><text start="1818.899" dur="3.0">because I believe that there&apos;s X Y and Z</text><text start="1821.0" dur="3.0">benefit</text><text start="1821.899" dur="3.841">you violated the rights of that person</text><text start="1824.0" dur="3.059">as an individual and that&apos;s a really</text><text start="1825.74" dur="3.0">slippery slope</text><text start="1827.059" dur="4.081">yeah well I mean it&apos;s like the</text><text start="1828.74" dur="4.14">engineering me wanted to find like more</text><text start="1831.14" dur="3.06">examples of does economic growth</text><text start="1832.88" dur="2.399">correlate with big government or small</text><text start="1834.2" dur="2.579">government</text><text start="1835.279" dur="3.841">um with respect to your example on the</text><text start="1836.779" dur="4.081">island I think that a pluralism of</text><text start="1839.12" dur="3.72">approaches to like in the United States</text><text start="1840.86" dur="3.96">we don&apos;t just have rule by the majority</text><text start="1842.84" dur="4.5">we also have the Constitution and the</text><text start="1844.82" dur="4.62">Bill of Rights and so to reduce reduce</text><text start="1847.34" dur="4.439">that doubt well yeah to reduce that down</text><text start="1849.44" dur="4.14">to the island I mean a world in which</text><text start="1851.779" dur="4.201">the majority rules but people have</text><text start="1853.58" dur="5.339">certain inalienable rights</text><text start="1855.98" dur="5.1">um limits what the majority can do to to</text><text start="1858.919" dur="4.321">the minority right yeah and that&apos;s</text><text start="1861.08" dur="4.86">that&apos;s a huge step forward you know</text><text start="1863.24" dur="6.179">that&apos;s why like the the Constitution and</text><text start="1865.94" dur="4.92">the Bill of Rights were so important uh</text><text start="1869.419" dur="3.0">the the problem is that they haven&apos;t</text><text start="1870.86" dur="3.84">been respected as much as they should</text><text start="1872.419" dur="4.5">and arguably they don&apos;t protect as much</text><text start="1874.7" dur="3.719">as they should but that idea that there</text><text start="1876.919" dur="4.021">are things that the majority can never</text><text start="1878.419" dur="4.62">vote on because they&apos;re inalienable to</text><text start="1880.94" dur="4.32">the individual that&apos;s that&apos;s huge and</text><text start="1883.039" dur="3.661">you know I obviously think that the the</text><text start="1885.26" dur="3.24">scope of things that should be</text><text start="1886.7" dur="4.5">inalienable to the individual is is</text><text start="1888.5" dur="4.679">quite large yeah it kind of comes back</text><text start="1891.2" dur="3.66">to immutability uh when it comes to</text><text start="1893.179" dur="3.36">enforcement of the Bill of Rights these</text><text start="1894.86" dur="4.439">are inalienable rights they&apos;re immutable</text><text start="1896.539" dur="4.02">rights yes but but unlike a blockchain</text><text start="1899.299" dur="3.12">these are just words written by</text><text start="1900.559" dur="4.021">politicians and they get degraded over</text><text start="1902.419" dur="3.661">time as people both forget about why</text><text start="1904.58" dur="2.699">they were there and also because they</text><text start="1906.08" dur="2.579">find</text><text start="1907.279" dur="4.861">you know</text><text start="1908.659" dur="5.461">um reasons to degrade it so this comes</text><text start="1912.14" dur="3.3">back to an idea Josh Stark who&apos;s at the</text><text start="1914.12" dur="3.539">ethereum foundation wrote this amazing</text><text start="1915.44" dur="4.02">post about where hardness comes from in</text><text start="1917.659" dur="6.181">the world hardness being</text><text start="1919.46" dur="6.719">um basically a uh source of of uh</text><text start="1923.84" dur="4.8">confidence that things will continue to</text><text start="1926.179" dur="4.141">be a certain way and his point was that</text><text start="1928.64" dur="4.139">hardness comes from atoms and</text><text start="1930.32" dur="4.2">institutions and blockchains so like the</text><text start="1932.779" dur="4.14">hardness of atoms means that there will</text><text start="1934.52" dur="4.86">only be so much gold on earth no one can</text><text start="1936.919" dur="3.98">make more more Gold without spending a</text><text start="1939.38" dur="4.5">lot of energy</text><text start="1940.899" dur="5.681">institutions from the DMV to the United</text><text start="1943.88" dur="5.46">States government uh to the Constitution</text><text start="1946.58" dur="4.56">are enforced socially and then</text><text start="1949.34" dur="3.36">blockchains are for enforced</text><text start="1951.14" dur="4.139">technologically and then kind of like</text><text start="1952.7" dur="4.979">socially below that so it kind of comes</text><text start="1955.279" dur="4.441">down to where does the hardness or</text><text start="1957.679" dur="5.22">confidence that this will be enforced</text><text start="1959.72" dur="5.699">come from I think in both of these views</text><text start="1962.899" dur="4.201">yeah and then there&apos;s a spectrum there</text><text start="1965.419" dur="3.181">you know certainly like the physics of</text><text start="1967.1" dur="4.26">atoms is</text><text start="1968.6" dur="4.079">is completely hard like it follows</text><text start="1971.36" dur="3.9">um rules that are not violated</text><text start="1972.679" dur="4.141">blockchains are quite close to that like</text><text start="1975.26" dur="3.84">maybe all the way there like they</text><text start="1976.82" dur="4.5">operate on their on their code precisely</text><text start="1979.1" dur="4.5">as as is written</text><text start="1981.32" dur="4.02">um and yes their rules can change but</text><text start="1983.6" dur="3.48">that the rules can change is one of the</text><text start="1985.34" dur="4.319">rules so that&apos;s actually not a violation</text><text start="1987.08" dur="3.9">right what you know about blockchains is</text><text start="1989.659" dur="3.301">that they will always operate according</text><text start="1990.98" dur="3.72">to the code and this is a very powerful</text><text start="1992.96" dur="4.439">feature that people really haven&apos;t</text><text start="1994.7" dur="5.64">appreciated yet in terms of like</text><text start="1997.399" dur="5.64">if you care about Law and Order</text><text start="2000.34" dur="5.76">uh blockchains are incredible because</text><text start="2003.039" dur="5.701">they execute the rules objectively 100</text><text start="2006.1" dur="4.439">all the time most people think of you</text><text start="2008.74" dur="4.2">know crypto as sort of an anarchic World</text><text start="2010.539" dur="4.081">a wild west of these crazy Libertarians</text><text start="2012.94" dur="3.719">that like just don&apos;t like rules</text><text start="2014.62" dur="4.559">and that&apos;s so not that&apos;s so not true at</text><text start="2016.659" dur="4.02">all you know the Bitcoin is is a harder</text><text start="2019.179" dur="3.48">set of rules than anything that the</text><text start="2020.679" dur="4.681">United States government uh has ever</text><text start="2022.659" dur="4.801">created and will ever create so I think</text><text start="2025.36" dur="4.799">arguing it from a point of like</text><text start="2027.46" dur="4.8">um we care about order and Rule and thus</text><text start="2030.159" dur="4.02">we like blockchains I think that&apos;s a</text><text start="2032.26" dur="4.2">that&apos;s a compelling case</text><text start="2034.179" dur="4.141">yeah I want to introduce one more sort</text><text start="2036.46" dur="3.9">of a knowledge primitive</text><text start="2038.32" dur="6.12">um to the conversation and and that&apos;s</text><text start="2040.36" dur="6.36">this post uh by vitalik about legitimacy</text><text start="2044.44" dur="4.86">um have you read this one no</text><text start="2046.72" dur="4.32">so so basically vitalik uh sort of</text><text start="2049.3" dur="4.619">claims here that legitimacy is a pattern</text><text start="2051.04" dur="4.619">of higher order acceptance an outcome in</text><text start="2053.919" dur="3.781">a social context is legitimate if the</text><text start="2055.659" dur="5.161">people in that social context play their</text><text start="2057.7" dur="5.459">role in enacting that outcome so</text><text start="2060.82" dur="5.46">um legitimacy according to vitalik in</text><text start="2063.159" dur="4.02">this post uh can be achieved by Brute</text><text start="2066.28" dur="3.359">Force</text><text start="2067.179" dur="4.141">which is you know I think what you would</text><text start="2069.639" dur="3.48">argue well I want to put words in your</text><text start="2071.32" dur="4.319">mouth but maybe someone would argue that</text><text start="2073.119" dur="4.56">uh the the government uh the US</text><text start="2075.639" dur="3.48">government does we have a monopoly on</text><text start="2077.679" dur="3.42">force and therefore we can enforce</text><text start="2079.119" dur="4.701">legitimacy there can be legitimacy by</text><text start="2081.099" dur="6.3">continuity legitimacy by fairness</text><text start="2083.82" dur="6.16">legitimacy by process by performance and</text><text start="2087.399" dur="5.28">by participation so</text><text start="2089.98" dur="4.699">um for me a lot of this value space that</text><text start="2092.679" dur="4.741">you and I are talking about right here</text><text start="2094.679" dur="5.381">is kind of like different narrative</text><text start="2097.42" dur="6.179">frames on where legitimacy comes from</text><text start="2100.06" dur="4.98">and where it does not come from</text><text start="2103.599" dur="2.881">um and and so I feel like this is an</text><text start="2105.04" dur="2.819">important knowledge like if we&apos;re going</text><text start="2106.48" dur="3.42">to build cooperation across social</text><text start="2107.859" dur="6.961">distance because</text><text start="2109.9" dur="6.78">um a lefty like me might say oh well uh</text><text start="2114.82" dur="4.86">if we fund public goods with taxes</text><text start="2116.68" dur="5.34">that&apos;s legitimacy by performance and and</text><text start="2119.68" dur="3.72">and maybe by process</text><text start="2122.02" dur="2.76">um and someone on the other side of the</text><text start="2123.4" dur="3.6">spectrum would say like that&apos;s</text><text start="2124.78" dur="4.5">illegitimate because</text><text start="2127.0" dur="4.44">um from first principles taxation is</text><text start="2129.28" dur="3.36">theft so I mean we&apos;ll get into the sort</text><text start="2131.44" dur="3.24">of disagreements between those things</text><text start="2132.64" dur="3.54">but I just want to introduce the idea of</text><text start="2134.68" dur="3.84">legitimacy higher order social</text><text start="2136.18" dur="3.96">acceptance as an important primitive in</text><text start="2138.52" dur="3.0">a lot of the examples that were that</text><text start="2140.14" dur="2.939">we&apos;re talking to how does that resonate</text><text start="2141.52" dur="5.22">with you</text><text start="2143.079" dur="5.941">that&apos;s fair I think legitimacy</text><text start="2146.74" dur="5.28">um isn&apos;t a universal</text><text start="2149.02" dur="6.96">um so it&apos;s a very subjective judgment</text><text start="2152.02" dur="5.94">so uh I might judge an outcome to be</text><text start="2155.98" dur="4.859">illegitimate or legitimate and you might</text><text start="2157.96" dur="5.399">disagree and that&apos;s that&apos;s okay</text><text start="2160.839" dur="5.041">um like I think it&apos;s hard to to cast it</text><text start="2163.359" dur="4.561">as a universal that something is is</text><text start="2165.88" dur="3.6">legitimate or not because of one reason</text><text start="2167.92" dur="3.48">across all people</text><text start="2169.48" dur="3.24">it&apos;s a I think it&apos;s an assessment that</text><text start="2171.4" dur="3.3">every individual has to make on a</text><text start="2172.72" dur="3.84">certain outcome and they can use those</text><text start="2174.7" dur="3.419">those factors you know the metallic</text><text start="2176.56" dur="3.96">highlights in the Judgment of whether</text><text start="2178.119" dur="4.621">they think it&apos;s legitimate or not</text><text start="2180.52" dur="4.86">yeah</text><text start="2182.74" dur="3.72">well uh we have 25 minutes left and I</text><text start="2185.38" dur="3.0">really want to get to the meat of the</text><text start="2186.46" dur="3.78">discussion which is the healthy tension</text><text start="2188.38" dur="3.959">between</text><text start="2190.24" dur="4.32">um what I would see is</text><text start="2192.339" dur="4.141">well look</text><text start="2194.56" dur="4.019">um I think that you have good arguments</text><text start="2196.48" dur="4.98">from first principles that taxation is</text><text start="2198.579" dur="4.981">theft and um that people shouldn&apos;t go be</text><text start="2201.46" dur="4.32">coerced into</text><text start="2203.56" dur="4.14">having their money taken from them I</text><text start="2205.78" dur="3.54">think that people on the left who care</text><text start="2207.7" dur="3.06">about pro-social causes who care about</text><text start="2209.32" dur="3.299">environmentalism things that I would</text><text start="2210.76" dur="3.3">call public goods</text><text start="2212.619" dur="3.901">um</text><text start="2214.06" dur="3.6">have a good reason that we want to fund</text><text start="2216.52" dur="2.579">public goods we&apos;re having this</text><text start="2217.66" dur="3.419">conversation for example over the</text><text start="2219.099" dur="4.441">Internet which was invented by arpa</text><text start="2221.079" dur="4.5">which is funded by a government grant so</text><text start="2223.54" dur="3.539">you know like for me the argument that</text><text start="2225.579" dur="3.421">we want to fund public goods is like hey</text><text start="2227.079" dur="4.741">wouldn&apos;t you pay 20 of your salary to</text><text start="2229.0" dur="4.02">have a one thousand percent Better World</text><text start="2231.82" dur="3.539">um which you know we&apos;ll get into</text><text start="2233.02" dur="3.72">debating those numbers I&apos;m sure but the</text><text start="2235.359" dur="2.881">opportunity that I see Eric and the</text><text start="2236.74" dur="3.9">reason I wanted to do this podcast with</text><text start="2238.24" dur="4.56">you is that what if we could fund public</text><text start="2240.64" dur="5.88">goods without coercion from governments</text><text start="2242.8" dur="6.299">then we could unite the Libertarians and</text><text start="2246.52" dur="4.02">the lefties like me around creating a</text><text start="2249.099" dur="3.661">world in which our Commons are well</text><text start="2250.54" dur="4.26">funded but we don&apos;t need to use coercion</text><text start="2252.76" dur="4.02">in order to do it and maybe you know</text><text start="2254.8" dur="4.26">there&apos;s a world in which when I fund the</text><text start="2256.78" dur="3.839">the like instead of just paying my taxes</text><text start="2259.06" dur="4.26">and it goes to whatever the bureaucrats</text><text start="2260.619" dur="4.201">want I can like have a check box where I</text><text start="2263.32" dur="3.06">give to the collective and I say I want</text><text start="2264.82" dur="3.06">to fund the potholes in my community</text><text start="2266.38" dur="3.239">center but not the war in the Middle</text><text start="2267.88" dur="3.959">East or something like that</text><text start="2269.619" dur="3.661">um and so and and so you know I&apos;m trying</text><text start="2271.839" dur="2.821">to build this cooperation across social</text><text start="2273.28" dur="3.12">distance between the people who are in</text><text start="2274.66" dur="4.38">your camp and the people who are more in</text><text start="2276.4" dur="4.56">my camp and I&apos;m just wondering how can</text><text start="2279.04" dur="3.42">how can we do that does crypto enable</text><text start="2280.96" dur="3.84">that is there a window of opportunity am</text><text start="2282.46" dur="3.659">I the only one who sees it and yeah I</text><text start="2284.8" dur="2.46">know that there&apos;s a lot there but that&apos;s</text><text start="2286.119" dur="2.341">where I&apos;d love to spend the next 25</text><text start="2287.26" dur="4.02">minutes</text><text start="2288.46" dur="5.399">well yeah I mean just</text><text start="2291.28" dur="4.86">just the recognition that it&apos;s a good</text><text start="2293.859" dur="4.621">thing to fund public goods without</text><text start="2296.14" dur="3.719">coercion is great I mean that&apos;s a</text><text start="2298.48" dur="3.72">virtuous statement that I would stand</text><text start="2299.859" dur="3.48">behind 100 percent</text><text start="2302.2" dur="3.48">um</text><text start="2303.339" dur="3.841">yeah let&apos;s find ways to fund the public</text><text start="2305.68" dur="3.12">goods without coercion like that&apos;s a</text><text start="2307.18" dur="3.12">that&apos;s a Libertarian perspective</text><text start="2308.8" dur="3.42">absolutely you know certainly</text><text start="2310.3" dur="3.24">Libertarians aren&apos;t opposed to public</text><text start="2312.22" dur="2.28">goods</text><text start="2313.54" dur="3.48">um they&apos;re not opposed to the</text><text start="2314.5" dur="4.56">environment they&apos;re not opposed to roads</text><text start="2317.02" dur="4.86">they&apos;re not opposed to the internet</text><text start="2319.06" dur="5.039">they are opposed to coercion and so um</text><text start="2321.88" dur="5.1">yeah I mean that&apos;s that&apos;s a good way of</text><text start="2324.099" dur="4.321">starting that discussion for sure so um</text><text start="2326.98" dur="3.78">I really want to pinch and zoom on that</text><text start="2328.42" dur="4.08">point it makes me so excited for you to</text><text start="2330.76" dur="3.78">say that Eric because you sent this</text><text start="2332.5" dur="3.839">tweet in February of 2022 that said like</text><text start="2334.54" dur="4.319">I love public goods and obviously</text><text start="2336.339" dur="5.101">they&apos;re critical to deny public goods is</text><text start="2338.859" dur="4.861">to deny the error that we breathe and I</text><text start="2341.44" dur="4.2">think that holy [ __ ] that made me so</text><text start="2343.72" dur="4.02">excited that there&apos;s an opportunity here</text><text start="2345.64" dur="5.16">for like this podcast episode but</text><text start="2347.74" dur="6.119">generally like cooperation across people</text><text start="2350.8" dur="5.34">who view legitimacy as derived from very</text><text start="2353.859" dur="4.621">different places and it you know I I</text><text start="2356.14" dur="3.66">guess I&apos;m I&apos;m just like want to ask the</text><text start="2358.48" dur="3.42">question like how can we build this</text><text start="2359.8" dur="3.42">world where we fund public goods in this</text><text start="2361.9" dur="4.98">way</text><text start="2363.22" dur="5.76">well I think it&apos;s important to</text><text start="2366.88" dur="3.959">point out maybe where we might differ on</text><text start="2368.98" dur="3.84">something here which is that I I would</text><text start="2370.839" dur="3.841">like a world where there&apos;s as few public</text><text start="2372.82" dur="3.66">goods as possible</text><text start="2374.68" dur="4.5">and yet I acknowledge that some exist</text><text start="2376.48" dur="4.32">right air being a great a great one</text><text start="2379.18" dur="3.0">um but the environment generally being a</text><text start="2380.8" dur="5.1">good one</text><text start="2382.18" dur="6.72">um but I think uh humans work best when</text><text start="2385.9" dur="5.219">things are privatized because it aligns</text><text start="2388.9" dur="5.04">the the native self-interest that people</text><text start="2391.119" dur="5.22">have with the outcomes</text><text start="2393.94" dur="3.899">um so I want to reduce the scope in</text><text start="2396.339" dur="3.661">which something is considered a public</text><text start="2397.839" dur="4.681">good but I know that that scope can&apos;t be</text><text start="2400.0" dur="4.26">reduced to zero and there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2402.52" dur="3.66">things that I&apos;m curious if you call them</text><text start="2404.26" dur="3.78">public goods so like for example is the</text><text start="2406.18" dur="4.32">ethereum blockchain a public good in</text><text start="2408.04" dur="5.52">your in your view</text><text start="2410.5" dur="4.5">um you know what&apos;s fun is that uh since</text><text start="2413.56" dur="3.66">I founded getcoin which is all about</text><text start="2415.0" dur="2.96">public goods uh</text><text start="2417.22" dur="3.72">uh</text><text start="2417.96" dur="4.42">I started getting tagged in all these uh</text><text start="2420.94" dur="3.0">Twitter debates where it was like Hey</text><text start="2422.38" dur="3.239">Kevin this has a grant is it a public</text><text start="2423.94" dur="3.12">good and I was expected to like go on</text><text start="2425.619" dur="2.341">record about all these different things</text><text start="2427.06" dur="2.4">and</text><text start="2427.96" dur="4.02">um the fun part about Bitcoin being a</text><text start="2429.46" dur="4.8">dow is I could be like uh like go take a</text><text start="2431.98" dur="4.379">hike the Dow could decide</text><text start="2434.26" dur="3.48">um but I can&apos;t Dodge that here I can&apos;t I</text><text start="2436.359" dur="4.26">can&apos;t do that Dodge here with you it</text><text start="2437.74" dur="5.82">will emerge from consensus yeah yeah and</text><text start="2440.619" dur="4.74">um so yeah uh to actually answer your</text><text start="2443.56" dur="3.48">question and not get into like some meta</text><text start="2445.359" dur="2.76">commentary about where legitimacy comes</text><text start="2447.04" dur="4.14">from</text><text start="2448.119" dur="5.581">um Dao processes or the founders Vision</text><text start="2451.18" dur="3.72">um I actually think that there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="2453.7" dur="3.36">of things that are on a spectrum of</text><text start="2454.9" dur="4.86">public private Goods uh ethereum is a</text><text start="2457.06" dur="4.019">double-sided Marketplace between</text><text start="2459.76" dur="2.76">um people who are writing to the</text><text start="2461.079" dur="2.76">blockchain and people who are reading to</text><text start="2462.52" dur="3.54">the blockchain this is overly</text><text start="2463.839" dur="4.441">reductionist but like anyone can read</text><text start="2466.06" dur="4.68">from the state of ethereum and figure</text><text start="2468.28" dur="4.5">out what the global consensus is and do</text><text start="2470.74" dur="3.66">it for free and that is a public good</text><text start="2472.78" dur="3.2">but the ability to broadcast a</text><text start="2474.4" dur="4.26">transaction and write to the chain</text><text start="2475.98" dur="4.66">requires money and it is excludable and</text><text start="2478.66" dur="4.08">rivalrous and so it&apos;s not a public good</text><text start="2480.64" dur="4.14">and so you know the hyper object of</text><text start="2482.74" dur="3.839">ethereum is this double-sided or maybe</text><text start="2484.78" dur="3.839">triple-sided Market depending on how you</text><text start="2486.579" dur="3.78">count it in one side is a public good</text><text start="2488.619" dur="3.5">and another side is like this privatized</text><text start="2490.359" dur="5.281">Market good</text><text start="2492.119" dur="5.74">interesting so does a does a public good</text><text start="2495.64" dur="4.199">require as a prerequisite that it&apos;s</text><text start="2497.859" dur="4.621">that has free access</text><text start="2499.839" dur="5.221">so public goods the economics definition</text><text start="2502.48" dur="5.7">is something that is non-rival risks and</text><text start="2505.06" dur="4.74">non-excludable so um I am breathing air</text><text start="2508.18" dur="3.24">right now and the fact that I am</text><text start="2509.8" dur="3.779">breathing air does not create a</text><text start="2511.42" dur="4.26">rivalrousness with you Eric that you can</text><text start="2513.579" dur="3.78">breathe air and I cannot exclude you</text><text start="2515.68" dur="3.179">from breathing clean air and that&apos;s what</text><text start="2517.359" dur="4.141">makes clean air a public good is that</text><text start="2518.859" dur="5.281">it&apos;s non-rival and non-excludable so</text><text start="2521.5" dur="4.92">roads and water</text><text start="2524.14" dur="4.62">are not public goods</text><text start="2526.42" dur="4.199">yeah so um there&apos;s actually a two by two</text><text start="2528.76" dur="3.839">Matrix if you Google public goods and</text><text start="2530.619" dur="4.081">you click on uh images you&apos;ll see a two</text><text start="2532.599" dur="4.561">by two Matrix where there&apos;s excludable</text><text start="2534.7" dur="3.78">non-excludable and rivalous non-rival</text><text start="2537.16" dur="5.64">risks</text><text start="2538.48" dur="5.7">um roads are I think in the in uh</text><text start="2542.8" dur="3.6">they&apos;re they&apos;re non-excludable because</text><text start="2544.18" dur="3.72">anyone can really drive onto them</text><text start="2546.4" dur="4.14">um but they&apos;re rival risks in that they</text><text start="2547.9" dur="4.74">only have limited capacity and the</text><text start="2550.54" dur="4.5">technical economics name for that is is</text><text start="2552.64" dur="4.14">a common good so something that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="2555.04" dur="4.079">scarce but like it&apos;s pretty hard to</text><text start="2556.78" dur="4.559">exclude</text><text start="2559.119" dur="3.841">gotcha okay</text><text start="2561.339" dur="4.5">understood</text><text start="2562.96" dur="4.92">yeah so um</text><text start="2565.839" dur="3.841">to me the I want to go back to what you</text><text start="2567.88" dur="3.18">said about the the main point of diff</text><text start="2569.68" dur="2.82">difference because we&apos;re going to build</text><text start="2571.06" dur="2.94">this cooperation across social distance</text><text start="2572.5" dur="3.18">we should spend time on where there&apos;s</text><text start="2574.0" dur="2.52">the most difference</text><text start="2575.68" dur="2.78">um</text><text start="2576.52" dur="4.02">you said that you wanted to minimize</text><text start="2578.46" dur="3.639">public goods and as many things that</text><text start="2580.54" dur="2.7">should be privatized as possible I don&apos;t</text><text start="2582.099" dur="2.581">want to put words in your mouth is is</text><text start="2583.24" dur="4.8">that fair</text><text start="2584.68" dur="4.5">yeah like uh take health care for</text><text start="2588.04" dur="3.18">example</text><text start="2589.18" dur="4.38">um I don&apos;t think people have a right to</text><text start="2591.22" dur="4.2">Health Care the reason is because</text><text start="2593.56" dur="3.299">it has to be provided by someone so to</text><text start="2595.42" dur="3.419">say you have a right to it is to say</text><text start="2596.859" dur="4.441">someone else has an obligation to</text><text start="2598.839" dur="4.561">provide it to you which is slavery</text><text start="2601.3" dur="3.48">and um I don&apos;t believe in slavery</text><text start="2603.4" dur="3.3">because I believe people should be</text><text start="2604.78" dur="4.319">peaceful with each other</text><text start="2606.7" dur="4.8">um so that&apos;s that&apos;s an example of</text><text start="2609.099" dur="3.961">something that I would call like not not</text><text start="2611.5" dur="3.48">a public good should not be treated as a</text><text start="2613.06" dur="3.42">public good</text><text start="2614.98" dur="2.879">um there&apos;s I think there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2616.48" dur="3.119">things that those on the left would like</text><text start="2617.859" dur="3.181">to call public goods and I&apos;m not</text><text start="2619.599" dur="3.601">claiming that you&apos;re one of them but</text><text start="2621.04" dur="4.26">they&apos;ll throw anything that people want</text><text start="2623.2" dur="4.619">like kind of any base needs that people</text><text start="2625.3" dur="5.34">have as public goods because then once</text><text start="2627.819" dur="5.581">you do it you justify all kind of um</text><text start="2630.64" dur="7.86">coercion in granting those to people so</text><text start="2633.4" dur="7.199">food education Healthcare roads internet</text><text start="2638.5" dur="3.66">um you know I&apos;ve heard people say cell</text><text start="2640.599" dur="4.081">phones are like a</text><text start="2642.16" dur="5.4">public good and and people have a right</text><text start="2644.68" dur="5.22">to them so that that kind of goes off in</text><text start="2647.56" dur="5.58">some interesting directions but um yeah</text><text start="2649.9" dur="5.76">I want to because public goods are</text><text start="2653.14" dur="4.14">tricky I want to limit</text><text start="2655.66" dur="3.06">the scope of them and then actually</text><text start="2657.28" dur="3.839">tackle the ones that are the most</text><text start="2658.72" dur="4.26">difficult and certainly environmental</text><text start="2661.119" dur="3.601">pollution I think is is the most</text><text start="2662.98" dur="3.48">important of those</text><text start="2664.72" dur="3.92">yeah</text><text start="2666.46" dur="2.18">um</text><text start="2668.68" dur="3.96">so I mean I I think just like</text><text start="2670.48" dur="3.66">recognizing that they&apos;re tricky and why</text><text start="2672.64" dur="3.36">they&apos;re tricky</text><text start="2674.14" dur="3.66">is maybe the highest leverage point for</text><text start="2676.0" dur="3.72">this conversation because then that like</text><text start="2677.8" dur="4.019">everything else derives from that so in</text><text start="2679.72" dur="4.02">my mind public goods are tricky because</text><text start="2681.819" dur="3.481">because they&apos;re non-excludable and</text><text start="2683.74" dur="4.32">non-river risk that means that it&apos;s hard</text><text start="2685.3" dur="4.799">to build a business model for protecting</text><text start="2688.06" dur="4.2">them and we know from Eleanor ostrom&apos;s</text><text start="2690.099" dur="3.901">uh eight principles of protecting the</text><text start="2692.26" dur="4.2">commons is that you need to be able to</text><text start="2694.0" dur="4.319">gate people&apos;s like access to them if</text><text start="2696.46" dur="4.139">you&apos;re going to maintain them over the</text><text start="2698.319" dur="4.381">long term and so for me the the biggest</text><text start="2700.599" dur="3.301">problem with public goods is that</text><text start="2702.7" dur="3.06">there&apos;s no business model for</text><text start="2703.9" dur="4.32">maintaining them which means that we all</text><text start="2705.76" dur="4.38">go get jobs at like JP Morgan or some</text><text start="2708.22" dur="3.599">like private company so that we can pay</text><text start="2710.14" dur="2.699">our mortgage so that we can get food on</text><text start="2711.819" dur="3.241">the table so that we can access</text><text start="2712.839" dur="3.421">education and health care which means</text><text start="2715.06" dur="3.24">that</text><text start="2716.26" dur="3.839">um there&apos;s not money or Capital flowing</text><text start="2718.3" dur="3.66">back to the commons absent a course of</text><text start="2720.099" dur="3.961">government forcing people to do it but</text><text start="2721.96" dur="3.96">the flip side of that to me is that</text><text start="2724.06" dur="3.539">there&apos;s no feedback mechanisms about</text><text start="2725.92" dur="4.14">which public goods we actually care</text><text start="2727.599" dur="4.26">about because no one is paying for them</text><text start="2730.06" dur="4.559">it&apos;s just left to some like Central</text><text start="2731.859" dur="4.681">State planning bureaucrat to figure out</text><text start="2734.619" dur="3.841">which public goods tax dollars should go</text><text start="2736.54" dur="4.44">to and the most beautiful thing for me</text><text start="2738.46" dur="4.08">about markets is that you get this</text><text start="2740.98" dur="3.54">collective intelligence mechanism of</text><text start="2742.54" dur="3.66">like wow people really love shapeshift</text><text start="2744.52" dur="3.78">and therefore shapeshift has more</text><text start="2746.2" dur="3.6">Capital to invest in making shapeshift</text><text start="2748.3" dur="3.96">better and it creates this virtuous</text><text start="2749.8" dur="4.86">cycle where like shapeshift uh does even</text><text start="2752.26" dur="4.5">better and so what if there was a way to</text><text start="2754.66" dur="3.72">combine the collective intelligence of</text><text start="2756.76" dur="4.94">markets</text><text start="2758.38" dur="5.16">um with this sort of like non-excludably</text><text start="2761.7" dur="3.04">non-non-rivalrousness of public goods</text><text start="2763.54" dur="3.6">that feels like it would be the best of</text><text start="2764.74" dur="4.2">both worlds to me but I don&apos;t know you</text><text start="2767.14" dur="3.24">said public goods are tricky that&apos;s what</text><text start="2768.94" dur="3.06">comes up for me when I think about</text><text start="2770.38" dur="3.66">public goods being tricky I&apos;m curious</text><text start="2772.0" dur="4.14">what comes up for you in terms of why</text><text start="2774.04" dur="4.799">public goods are so tricky</text><text start="2776.14" dur="5.52">yeah I think you you defined that well</text><text start="2778.839" dur="5.041">like who the issue is the tragedy the</text><text start="2781.66" dur="3.9">comments generally yeah like who who</text><text start="2783.88" dur="3.6">takes care of the thing when it&apos;s when</text><text start="2785.56" dur="2.7">it&apos;s a public good</text><text start="2787.48" dur="2.94">um</text><text start="2788.26" dur="4.5">and you know part of I think what helps</text><text start="2790.42" dur="5.28">in the discussion is to define specific</text><text start="2792.76" dur="6.24">public goods and talk about those right</text><text start="2795.7" dur="5.46">like uh is there a universal way to</text><text start="2799.0" dur="3.839">solve the problems of public goods writ</text><text start="2801.16" dur="4.14">large</text><text start="2802.839" dur="4.921">um that sounds like a tall order but to</text><text start="2805.3" dur="4.319">take a specific one and to try to figure</text><text start="2807.76" dur="5.16">out solutions to solve that one in</text><text start="2809.619" dur="5.041">particular uh is certainly a noble goal</text><text start="2812.92" dur="3.78">yeah</text><text start="2814.66" dur="4.26">um</text><text start="2816.7" dur="4.8">well yeah I mean I think that like</text><text start="2818.92" dur="4.74">the crypto the vision that I see</text><text start="2821.5" dur="5.22">emerging out of the crypto ecosystem is</text><text start="2823.66" dur="6.3">a very holonic uh way of funding public</text><text start="2826.72" dur="5.94">goods Hollands are this idea that</text><text start="2829.96" dur="4.859">um every every everything is both a part</text><text start="2832.66" dur="5.1">and a hole in itself you know for</text><text start="2834.819" dur="4.821">example like I&apos;m Kevin I&apos;m an individual</text><text start="2837.76" dur="4.8">you&apos;re Eric you&apos;re an individual</text><text start="2839.64" dur="4.36">together and with other people in the</text><text start="2842.56" dur="3.72">crypto Community we make up the Colorado</text><text start="2844.0" dur="3.66">crypto community and then we&apos;re part of</text><text start="2846.28" dur="3.6">this greater whole which is the Colorado</text><text start="2847.66" dur="4.08">Community and</text><text start="2849.88" dur="4.199">um so if I have like Hollands are just</text><text start="2851.74" dur="3.54">basically drawing a circle around</text><text start="2854.079" dur="4.921">um</text><text start="2855.28" dur="6.78">groups of of of of of of other Hollands</text><text start="2859.0" dur="5.819">and um the holonica view of of funding</text><text start="2862.06" dur="5.82">public goods is like to find a Define a</text><text start="2864.819" dur="4.981">border around a community and to find a</text><text start="2867.88" dur="4.38">mechanism for Distributing Capital to</text><text start="2869.8" dur="5.22">public goods in a funding source for</text><text start="2872.26" dur="5.76">Distributing uh Capital public goods and</text><text start="2875.02" dur="4.5">like you know the example of uh like we</text><text start="2878.02" dur="4.68">could just use the example of ethereum</text><text start="2879.52" dur="6.599">the public good of uh the consensus</text><text start="2882.7" dur="4.8">mechanism of the ethereum network is</text><text start="2886.119" dur="4.861">um is determined by the consensus</text><text start="2887.5" dur="5.52">algorithm of of proof of of proof of</text><text start="2890.98" dur="4.26">stake and the funding mechanism is that</text><text start="2893.02" dur="5.22">people who are doing the rights to the</text><text start="2895.24" dur="5.04">network are taxed are sub or are</text><text start="2898.24" dur="3.42">subsidizing the public good of the</text><text start="2900.28" dur="3.66">entire network and that&apos;s like the whole</text><text start="2901.66" dur="3.9">on of the ethereum network</text><text start="2903.94" dur="5.82">um I wouldn&apos;t use the word text but I</text><text start="2905.56" dur="5.88">won&apos;t be pedantic about it sure yeah I I</text><text start="2909.76" dur="3.24">um and then like there&apos;s other public</text><text start="2911.44" dur="4.679">goods in the ethereum space like who</text><text start="2913.0" dur="4.44">maintains Geth in prism and</text><text start="2916.119" dur="2.881">um you know who funds the up and coming</text><text start="2917.44" dur="3.659">innovation in the ecosystem that&apos;s kind</text><text start="2919.0" dur="4.5">of like what Bitcoin grants is trying to</text><text start="2921.099" dur="4.621">be uh along with giveth and CLR fund and</text><text start="2923.5" dur="4.079">others is like create a mechanism and a</text><text start="2925.72" dur="3.359">funding source for the other public</text><text start="2927.579" dur="3.421">goods that aren&apos;t just like the</text><text start="2929.079" dur="4.081">transactional securement of the network</text><text start="2931.0" dur="4.2">so I might be belaboring the point but I</text><text start="2933.16" dur="2.88">think that the key part the key point to</text><text start="2935.2" dur="2.7">like</text><text start="2936.04" dur="3.48">how we fund public goods in an agoric</text><text start="2937.9" dur="3.12">way is drawing a whole lot around what</text><text start="2939.52" dur="2.88">the public good is and then finding a</text><text start="2941.02" dur="4.68">funding source and a mechanism for</text><text start="2942.4" dur="6.179">Distributing uh those public goods and</text><text start="2945.7" dur="4.139">so using that frame well first off I&apos;m</text><text start="2948.579" dur="2.76">curious if you have any feedback on that</text><text start="2949.839" dur="3.24">it might it might be overly complicated</text><text start="2951.339" dur="3.24">but um you know maybe we could actually</text><text start="2953.079" dur="3.0">object level talk about some public</text><text start="2954.579" dur="4.681">goods and how they could be funded in a</text><text start="2956.079" dur="6.24">non-coresive way using using that view</text><text start="2959.26" dur="4.26">yeah I mean I I think

dur="3.421">um</text><text start="2975.819" dur="4.201">like if you go out into the world and</text><text start="2978.04" dur="3.72">you see random strangers or you interact</text><text

because it&apos;s just</text><text start="2990.76" dur="4.38">sort of like a social faux pas but</text><text start="2993.52" dur="3.299">wouldn&apos;t wouldn&apos;t it be cool if like if</text><text start="2995.14" dur="3.54">you went to my Twitter profile and it</text><text start="2996.819" dur="3.601">showed like some Badges of the things</text><text start="2998.68" dur="3.12">that I&apos;ve contributed resources to and</text><text start="3000.42" dur="3.54">maybe including how much I&apos;ve</text><text start="3001.8" dur="4.799">contributed yeah and I would show those</text><text start="3003.96" dur="4.92">because I want to like say I care about</text><text start="3006.599" dur="4.141">these things and and look I&apos;m putting my</text><text start="3008.88" dur="3.9">money

about these</text><text start="3019.859" dur="3.301">things</text><text start="3021.06" dur="3.299">um and I wish that was the case you know</text><text start="3023.16" dur="3.6">and I I certainly don&apos;t know how to</text><text start="3024.359" dur="4.681">change the way Society Works in that</text><text start="3026.76" dur="4.98">regard but I wish it was more acceptable</text><text

actually like a skin in</text><text start="3037.02" dur="3.36">the game question right because you can</text><text start="3038.76" dur="3.18">go on Facebook and people will post all</text><text start="3040.38" dur="3.84">sorts of words about what they support</text><text start="3041.94" dur="4.139">right because words are cheap</text><text start="3044.22" dur="3.18">you know they&apos;ll post the the Ukraine</text><text start="3046.079" dur="4.621">flag on their profile and suddenly</text><text start="3047.4" dur="5.52">they&apos;re like a war hero and um</text><text start="3050.7" dur="5.159">there&apos;s just like there&apos;s no there&apos;s no</text><text start="3052.92" dur="4.919">teeth to it so I wish we could get to a</text><text start="3055.859" dur="3.181">place where teeth were there and people</text><text start="3057.839" dur="3.541">would demonstrate things like</text><text start="3059.04" dur="4.74">financially and how how effective it</text><text start="3061.38" dur="4.02">actually was yeah</text><text start="3063.78" dur="3.18">um well you know the what this excites</text><text start="3065.4" dur="4.02">me because a tweet that I&apos;ve sent in the</text><text start="3066.96" dur="5.46">past is like web2 is about virtue</text><text start="3069.42" dur="4.98">signaling uh and web3 could be about</text><text start="3072.42" dur="4.02">proof of virtue</text><text start="3074.4" dur="3.54">um and it&apos;s the exact same view like you</text><text start="3076.44" dur="2.639">go to someone&apos;s Tinder profile and you</text><text start="3077.94" dur="3.78">see all the virtues that they actually</text><text start="3079.079" dur="4.74">have cryptographically proven</text><text start="3081.72" dur="3.66">um Twitter profile you know whatever the</text><text start="3083.819" dur="4.26">social presence that you have you can</text><text start="3085.38" dur="4.38">have uh instead of poapps proof of proof</text><text start="3088.079" dur="2.76">of participation you can have you know</text><text start="3089.76" dur="2.88">proof</text><text start="3090.839" dur="3.901">prove a virtue and I think that that</text><text start="3092.64" dur="3.179">could be a really powerful</text><text start="3094.74" dur="2.879">um</text><text start="3095.819" dur="4.081">powerful thing to build</text><text start="3097.619" dur="3.601">um but but you know you know I I think</text><text start="3099.9" dur="2.82">that</text><text start="3101.22" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="3102.72" dur="3.42">the funding sources are only one half of</text><text start="3104.64" dur="3.3">the equation you have to find ways to</text><text start="3106.14" dur="3.12">raise money for public goods but then</text><text start="3107.94" dur="2.28">you have to route that money to the</text><text start="3109.26" dur="3.359">public goods that are actually</text><text start="3110.22" dur="5.7">legitimate and so you know I I support</text><text start="3112.619" dur="5.7">Ukraine because I gave a thousand die uh</text><text start="3115.92" dur="3.78">is is like one thing but like how did</text><text start="3118.319" dur="3.121">Ukraine like how is that actually</text><text start="3119.7" dur="4.139">distributed did they go to Ukraine Dao</text><text start="3121.44" dur="5.34">or did it go to some uh administrative</text><text start="3123.839" dur="5.101">charity that takes 89</text><text start="3126.78" dur="3.66">um off the top for administrative</text><text start="3128.94" dur="3.06">overhead this is the other by the way</text><text start="3130.44" dur="3.54">big opportunity I see with crypto and</text><text start="3132.0" dur="4.14">funding networks is that you can run a</text><text start="3133.98" dur="4.859">network a philanthropic network using</text><text start="3136.14" dur="4.14">blockchain and use the properties of</text><text start="3138.839" dur="3.961">blockchains of transparency and</text><text start="3140.28" dur="4.44">immutability uh in order to create way</text><text start="3142.8" dur="3.66">more effective organizations but less</text><text start="3144.72" dur="3.899">overhead organizations when it comes to</text><text start="3146.46" dur="4.379">actually Distributing the capital and to</text><text start="3148.619" dur="4.321">me like removing intermediaries is where</text><text start="3150.839" dur="3.181">it&apos;s at like I find the charity I don&apos;t</text><text start="3152.94" dur="2.46">wanted to go to the administrative</text><text start="3154.02" dur="3.12">overhead of that charity I wanted to go</text><text start="3155.4" dur="3.84">to creating object level impact that&apos;s</text><text start="3157.14" dur="4.08">another opportunity for crypto I see</text><text start="3159.24" dur="4.5">yeah well this is why Dallas can exist</text><text start="3161.22" dur="4.02">now is because like the the friction of</text><text start="3163.74" dur="3.42">moving money around and knowing where it</text><text start="3165.24" dur="3.9">is and accounting for it</text><text start="3167.16" dur="6.36">um has gone down drastically like Dallas</text><text start="3169.14" dur="6.66">Dallas can&apos;t work without blockchains</text><text start="3173.52" dur="3.96">um they you know they</text><text start="3175.8" dur="3.539">they only exist because of what</text><text start="3177.48" dur="4.68">blockchains have done to the ease and</text><text start="3179.339" dur="4.681">the frictionlessness of of funding and</text><text start="3182.16" dur="4.5">so there&apos;s no reason that those those</text><text start="3184.02" dur="4.559">benefits shouldn&apos;t accrue in other areas</text><text start="3186.66" dur="3.48">yeah absolutely</text><text start="3188.579" dur="2.76">well Eric you&apos;ve been really generous</text><text start="3190.14" dur="2.699">with your time I think that we&apos;ve only</text><text start="3191.339" dur="3.181">got seven minutes left on our booked</text><text start="3192.839" dur="3.78">time I I can go a few minutes over but I</text><text start="3194.52" dur="3.12">I don&apos;t want to put you in that position</text><text start="3196.619" dur="2.341">um is there anything that I didn&apos;t ask</text><text start="3197.64" dur="2.82">that you want to say or you know</text><text start="3198.96" dur="3.899">anything that you know if you had an</text><text start="3200.46" dur="4.74">audience of 7 000 sort of like crypto</text><text start="3202.859" dur="4.821">lefties that you would want them to want</text><text start="3205.2" dur="2.48">them to hear</text><text start="3209.04" dur="3.9">um</text><text start="3210.619" dur="4.72">yeah I think</text><text start="3212.94" dur="4.619">um you&apos;re Kevin leading by example here</text><text start="3215.339" dur="3.901">in attempting to find Common Ground</text><text start="3217.559" dur="3.901">among people who care about similar</text><text start="3219.24" dur="4.74">projects and I think that&apos;s a really</text><text start="3221.46" dur="4.619">that&apos;s a really important goal right so</text><text start="3223.98" dur="4.139">for the for the seven thousand lefties</text><text start="3226.079" dur="3.54">listening to this</text><text start="3228.119" dur="4.021">um try to figure out like what you</text><text start="3229.619" dur="7.021">really care about and find the people</text><text start="3232.14" dur="6.6">who who can help with those ends even if</text><text start="3236.64" dur="3.36">even if they don&apos;t agree with you and I</text><text start="3238.74" dur="3.359">think this is an important lesson in</text><text start="3240.0" dur="3.54">crypto generally the ends that we&apos;re all</text><text start="3242.099" dur="3.781">pursuing here is this like open</text><text start="3243.54" dur="4.079">decentralized Financial system and that</text><text start="3245.88" dur="4.5">is true of the most hardcore Bitcoin</text><text start="3247.619" dur="5.881">Maxi or the you know like rainbow</text><text start="3250.38" dur="5.1">unicorn wearing youth leftist</text><text start="3253.5" dur="3.54">um and everyone and everyone else like</text><text start="3255.48" dur="2.879">focus on those principles and try to</text><text start="3257.04" dur="3.299">build Common Ground I think that&apos;s</text><text start="3258.359" dur="4.021">that&apos;s like a</text><text start="3260.339" dur="4.381">that&apos;s a key virtue of humans generally</text><text start="3262.38" dur="4.02">is when they cooperate and we have these</text><text start="3264.72" dur="3.72">amazing tools of blockchains that allow</text><text start="3266.4" dur="4.679">us to cooperate at scale with huge</text><text start="3268.44" dur="6.36">economic power and if we let</text><text start="3271.079" dur="5.821">if we let ideologies cause us to create</text><text start="3274.8" dur="4.259">tribal divisions that don&apos;t need to be</text><text start="3276.9" dur="3.6">there I think that&apos;s a disservice to</text><text start="3279.059" dur="2.941">everything so</text><text start="3280.5" dur="4.02">um it&apos;s a long-winded way of just saying</text><text start="3282.0" dur="5.7">thank you Kevin for for caring about</text><text start="3284.52" dur="5.339">like Building Bridges and um I hope</text><text start="3287.7" dur="4.619">other people are inspired to do the same</text><text start="3289.859" dur="4.561">yeah well same to you Eric I mean</text><text start="3292.319" dur="4.141">obviously you&apos;re an OG in the space and</text><text start="3294.42" dur="4.86">you&apos;ve pushed the envelope of innovation</text><text start="3296.46" dur="4.379">with Satoshi Dice and shapeshift with</text><text start="3299.28" dur="3.36">non-custodial exchanges but also</text><text start="3300.839" dur="3.78">shapeshift becoming a Dao I think you&apos;re</text><text start="3302.64" dur="4.26">pushing the envelope of</text><text start="3304.619" dur="3.901">um but and and you&apos;re pushing the</text><text start="3306.9" dur="3.959">envelope of common ground in cooperation</text><text start="3308.52" dur="5.16">across social Distance by being an</text><text start="3310.859" dur="4.861">anti-tribal sane voice in the Bitcoin</text><text start="3313.68" dur="4.02">and ethereum and other crypto</text><text start="3315.72" dur="4.74">communities but I also just want to</text><text start="3317.7" dur="5.0">thank you for doing this podcast with me</text><text start="3320.46" dur="5.879">um I think that you reshuffle the dice</text><text start="3322.7" dur="6.46">uh a thousand times and people like me</text><text start="3326.339" dur="4.26">and people like you don&apos;t get to have</text><text start="3329.16" dur="3.54">uh</text><text start="3330.599" dur="4.681">uh time together in order to really</text><text start="3332.7" dur="4.98">resolve our distance our our differences</text><text start="3335.28" dur="4.86">and to build that Common Ground</text><text start="3337.68" dur="4.2">um I think that 900 times out of a</text><text start="3340.14" dur="3.84">thousand it&apos;s just like a Twitter flame</text><text start="3341.88" dur="3.959">War uh on social media and if we can</text><text start="3343.98" dur="4.02">find a way to build that cooperation</text><text start="3345.839" dur="4.201">across social distance</text><text start="3348.0" dur="3.18">um in the 21st century that&apos;s that&apos;s one</text><text start="3350.04" dur="3.42">of the things that would make me so</text><text start="3351.18" dur="4.2">bullish for for Humanity so um again</text><text start="3353.46" dur="4.02">you&apos;re leading by example and thanks for</text><text start="3355.38" dur="4.32">for uh joining me</text><text start="3357.48" dur="4.859">yeah no problem um really appreciate</text><text start="3359.7" dur="4.68">that and this is sort of why I hold this</text><text start="3362.339" dur="4.621">view of peace between individuals being</text><text start="3364.38" dur="4.02">so fundamental is because I I think you</text><text start="3366.96" dur="3.359">can cooperate and build common ground</text><text start="3368.4" dur="3.179">when two people start on the</text><text start="3370.319" dur="1.921">understanding that they won&apos;t harm each</text><text start="3371.579" dur="2.361">other</text><text start="3372.24" dur="3.72">and this is like a very Primal</text><text start="3373.94" dur="3.82">precondition but if two people are</text><text start="3375.96" dur="3.119">willing to say like I respect you I&apos;m</text><text start="3377.76" dur="4.44">not going to hurt you or steal from you</text><text start="3379.079" dur="4.561">and if you give me the same respect</text><text start="3382.2" dur="3.0">um we can disagree about everything we</text><text start="3383.64" dur="3.54">want but we know that we&apos;re safe with</text><text start="3385.2" dur="3.78">each other and we can find ways to build</text><text start="3387.18" dur="3.12">together and I think that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="3388.98" dur="2.94">really key that&apos;s where cooperation</text><text start="3390.3" dur="3.42">comes from and ultimately most of human</text><text start="3391.92" dur="3.3">progress</text><text start="3393.72" dur="2.76">it&apos;s a great place to end thanks again</text><text start="3395.22" dur="4.58">for joining me Eric</text><text start="3396.48" dur="3.32">thank you Kevin cheers</text><text
