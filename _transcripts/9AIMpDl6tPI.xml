start="190.72" dur="3.92">um</text><text start="191.599" dur="4.801">so open collective is</text><text start="194.64" dur="3.92">it&apos;s a constellation</text><text start="196.4" dur="4.96">right and we&apos;re on a mission to make</text><text start="198.56" dur="7.28">sure that communities are sustainable</text><text start="201.36" dur="4.48">and so the way we do it is the following</text><text start="205.92" dur="3.92">our financial and economic system is</text><text start="208.0" dur="2.959">used to having corporations and moving</text><text start="209.84" dur="2.8">money</text><text start="210.959" dur="4.801">between corporations</text><text start="212.64" dur="5.28">which forces you to be</text><text start="215.76" dur="6.24">somewhere in the world it forces you to</text><text start="217.92" dur="6.72">have a sort of hierarchical structure um</text><text start="222.0" dur="4.56">you know even if it&apos;s non-profit you</text><text start="224.64" dur="3.519">still need a president or an owner</text><text start="226.56" dur="3.84">someone to sign</text><text start="228.159" dur="5.121">for bank accounts like your folks in the</text><text start="230.4" dur="4.399">web 3 space know that that level of</text><text start="233.28" dur="3.92">concentration of power is not what</text><text start="234.799" dur="4.321">communities want or need</text><text start="237.2" dur="3.84">um and so</text><text start="239.12" dur="3.759">six years ago we set out on a mission to</text><text start="241.04" dur="3.759">make sure that communities could forget</text><text start="242.879" dur="4.401">about all of that and fundraise and</text><text start="244.799" dur="5.36">spend money in full transparency without</text><text start="247.28" dur="4.56">needing to become a bank account sorry a</text><text start="250.159" dur="2.8">legal entity or have their own bank</text><text start="251.84" dur="3.119">account</text><text start="252.959" dur="5.201">and this is how we do it we set up a</text><text start="254.959" dur="5.441">platform that is open collective inc</text><text start="258.16" dur="2.24">and</text><text start="260.56" dur="5.76">that platform is open source is create</text><text start="264.16" dur="4.24">is developed and maintained by open</text><text start="266.32" dur="3.68">collective in car company</text><text start="268.4" dur="3.76">and it&apos;s essentially a place where you</text><text start="270.0" dur="3.44">can have a collective you can fundraise</text><text start="272.16" dur="3.44">you can have events you can have</text><text start="273.44" dur="4.4">campaigns you can connect with your</text><text start="275.6" dur="3.68">community and you can spend money you</text><text start="277.84" dur="4.24">can pay people for</text><text start="279.28" dur="4.96">you know invoices or reimbursing for</text><text start="282.08" dur="4.559">expenses that they incurred while</text><text start="284.24" dur="4.72">working for their communities now this</text><text start="286.639" dur="3.601">open finances transparent platform is</text><text start="288.96" dur="3.679">paired with</text><text start="290.24" dur="3.92">a network of legal entities around the</text><text start="292.639" dur="3.201">world we have</text><text start="294.16" dur="4.479">you know right now on the platform about</text><text start="295.84" dur="5.44">400 entities around the world that what</text><text start="298.639" dur="4.081">they do is their custodials of the funds</text><text start="301.28" dur="2.8">right because the money still needs to</text><text start="302.72" dur="3.68">go somewhere</text><text start="304.08" dur="4.8">right and that somewhere is this network</text><text start="306.4" dur="5.12">of legal entities that kind of abstract</text><text start="308.88" dur="4.319">out all the complexity of reporting</text><text start="311.52" dur="3.84">taking care of taxes taking care of</text><text start="313.199" dur="4.161">local regulation so the communities</text><text start="315.36" dur="4.64">operate at one level of the stack and</text><text start="317.36" dur="5.04">everything else is abstracted out by</text><text start="320.0" dur="4.479">this kind of network of legal entities</text><text start="322.4" dur="3.92">so we created many of them we have a</text><text start="324.479" dur="3.761">charity in the us we have the open</text><text start="326.32" dur="4.319">source collective that is</text><text start="328.24" dur="4.799">dedicated to um</text><text start="330.639" dur="4.641">supporting the open source ecosystem we</text><text start="333.039" dur="4.081">have you know several entities like that</text><text start="335.28" dur="3.52">but we are also the platform is also</text><text start="337.12" dur="3.76">open and free for</text><text start="338.8" dur="5.76">anyone that wants to use it to kind of</text><text start="340.88" dur="3.68">support their own community</text><text start="345.199" dur="4.0">yeah and i just want to say</text><text start="347.039" dur="3.521">that you&apos;re an inspiration for me when i</text><text start="349.199" dur="4.161">started bitcoin the work that open</text><text start="350.56" dur="5.04">collective uh has done is</text><text start="353.36" dur="4.48">been really i think influential in the</text><text start="355.6" dur="3.68">open source sustainability movement what</text><text start="357.84" dur="3.6">are your some of your favorite projects</text><text start="359.28" dur="4.24">on the on the platform</text><text start="361.44" dur="3.599">um</text><text start="363.52" dur="5.2">that&apos;s almost like asking who&apos;s your</text><text start="365.039" dur="5.921">favorite child kevin you don&apos;t do that</text><text start="368.72" dur="2.24">right</text><text start="371.039" dur="2.16">so</text><text start="371.84" dur="3.12">look</text><text start="373.199" dur="4.401">you know we started really strong in the</text><text start="374.96" dur="4.72">open source world right because</text><text start="377.6" dur="4.719">um</text><text start="379.68" dur="4.72">the open source ecosystem was so ripe</text><text start="382.319" dur="3.681">for open collective when we started in</text><text start="384.4" dur="3.359">2016 like</text><text start="386.0" dur="3.759">all the coordination was already</text><text start="387.759" dur="5.44">happening so the coordination problem</text><text start="389.759" dur="6.16">was solved by github mostly and gitlab</text><text start="393.199" dur="5.521">and you know but you know it was already</text><text start="395.919" dur="5.12">solved there was someone already already</text><text start="398.72" dur="4.319">that enabled like all of this</text><text start="401.039" dur="3.041">coordination creativity collaboration to</text><text start="403.039" dur="3.6">happen</text><text start="404.08" dur="5.28">and the results of open source when we</text><text start="406.639" dur="4.721">started like the whole cultural argument</text><text start="409.36" dur="4.559">about yes or no to open source like was</text><text start="411.36" dur="4.16">already done in 2016 like there was no</text><text start="413.919" dur="2.641">question that we should be using open</text><text start="415.52" dur="2.48">source</text><text start="416.56" dur="3.6">the question was like how on earth are</text><text start="418.0" dur="3.44">we going to fund this because we have</text><text start="420.16" dur="3.36">all of these</text><text start="421.44" dur="4.0">companies using all of this technology</text><text start="423.52" dur="3.76">for free that is maintained by all of</text><text start="425.44" dur="2.96">these folks who are not making a living</text><text start="427.28" dur="4.4">out of it</text><text start="428.4" dur="5.28">and this is this system needs to um you</text><text start="431.68" dur="3.28">know to be better to improve</text><text start="433.68" dur="3.359">and so</text><text start="434.96" dur="4.72">that&apos;s where we started and that&apos;s still</text><text start="437.039" dur="4.0">definitely kind of where my heart is in</text><text start="439.68" dur="2.239">terms of</text><text start="441.039" dur="3.44">the</text><text start="441.919" dur="3.521">overall solution that that we that we</text><text start="444.479" dur="3.361">provide</text><text start="445.44" dur="4.56">and we&apos;ve been working in sustain you</text><text start="447.84" dur="5.12">know open source this festival for many</text><text start="450.0" dur="3.84">years and kind of really pushing forward</text><text start="452.96" dur="3.2">the</text><text start="453.84" dur="4.32">open source sustainability digital</text><text start="456.16" dur="2.8">infrastructure

start="462.0" dur="5.039">because that&apos;s really running on its own</text><text start="463.84" dur="5.84">it has i i don&apos;t know i think last last</text><text start="467.039" dur="5.681">year i think uh we moved 12 million</text><text start="469.68" dur="3.84">dollars to open source projects um and</text><text start="472.72" dur="2.56">so</text><text start="473.52" dur="3.519">just last year alone and this year we</text><text start="475.28" dur="4.4">are already it&apos;s may and we&apos;re already</text><text start="477.039" dur="4.081">there and so we&apos;ve been you know it&apos;s</text><text start="479.68" dur="2.959">been um</text><text start="481.12" dur="4.16">they don&apos;t need me anymore which is</text><text start="482.639" dur="4.481">great i&apos;m happy that that is happening i</text><text start="485.28" dur="3.84">like i work to make myself redundant</text><text start="487.12" dur="5.28">that is an important part of what i do</text><text start="489.12" dur="6.16">and so now i&apos;m i&apos;m focusing more on</text><text start="492.4" dur="6.4">um the charitable space and thinking</text><text start="495.28" dur="6.72">about decentralized um philanthropy kind</text><text start="498.8" dur="5.2">of the mutual aid um</text><text start="502.0" dur="4.0">mutual aid groups or the solidarity</text><text start="504.0" dur="3.44">economy in general co-op so i&apos;ve been</text><text start="506.0" dur="3.759">like the past couple of years i&apos;ve been</text><text start="507.44" dur="4.88">really like getting myself into that</text><text start="509.759" dur="3.681">space and i&apos;ve been building networks</text><text start="512.32" dur="4.88">there so</text><text start="513.44" dur="7.36">so that is what now it&apos;s kind of for me</text><text start="517.2" dur="5.6">in my daily in my daily work right</text><text start="520.8" dur="3.28">well i love that answer as you know get</text><text start="522.8" dur="2.88">coins sort of started out with the</text><text start="524.08" dur="3.36">mission of growing and sustaining open</text><text start="525.68" dur="3.68">source you and i met through this maine</text><text start="527.44" dur="3.04">community and through eric berry and</text><text start="529.36" dur="3.52">code fund</text><text start="530.48" dur="4.08">um and that that cause is just such a</text><text start="532.88" dur="2.56">close one to my heart</text><text start="534.56" dur="2.8">and</text><text start="535.44" dur="3.92">y&apos;all y&apos;all have supported some of the</text><text start="537.36" dur="3.36">most prominent web 2 open source</text><text start="539.36" dur="3.76">projects so i just think that that</text><text start="540.72" dur="3.84">you&apos;re an inspiration um and so i see</text><text start="543.12" dur="2.88">this kind of parody between the work</text><text start="544.56" dur="3.6">that you&apos;re doing and in what we&apos;re</text><text start="546.0" dur="3.519">doing in the in the web web3 space uh</text><text start="548.16" dur="3.6">when you say things like digital</text><text start="549.519"

was</text><text start="580.24" dur="4.08">so i think that</text><text start="582.16" dur="4.48">davos is solving a problem that we are</text><text start="584.32" dur="2.32">still</text><text start="587.279" dur="4.881">unable to solve right which is like</text><text start="589.839" dur="5.281">automatically</text><text start="592.16" dur="5.84">totally distributed um</text><text

we</text><text start="613.279" dur="5.12">have hundreds of them and what have you</text><text start="615.839" dur="4.24">but they are like a layer infrastructure</text><text start="618.399" dur="3.68">that is there and it connects to the</text><text start="620.079" dur="4.88">legacy system a lot that you report to</text><text start="622.079" dur="5.44">that whatever irs or or you know you</text><text start="624.959" dur="4.241">still are regular highly regulated i</text><text start="627.519" dur="3.361">don&apos;t know if that just what we want to</text><text start="629.2" dur="4.4">do is kind of abstract that out for</text><text start="630.88" dur="5.519">groups but those are doing that in a</text><text start="633.6" dur="5.28">much more fluid and efficient way</text><text start="636.399" dur="4.481">because it kind of</text><text start="638.88" dur="3.44">it just escapes the problem altogether</text><text start="640.88" dur="3.12">right you&apos;re building something else</text><text start="642.32" dur="2.8">somewhere else and there&apos;s like no</text><text start="644.0" dur="3.04">connection</text><text start="645.12" dur="3.92">right no

you&apos;re</text><text start="651.76" dur="4.24">like somewhere else</text><text start="653.279" dur="4.56">and and and for me that the way i see</text><text start="656.0" dur="4.8">that is where we&apos;re going</text><text start="657.839" dur="5.281">um i don&apos;t think we cannot get there</text><text start="660.8" dur="4.64">right so that&apos;s the first kind of</text><text start="663.12" dur="4.64">you know maybe maybe inside i think that</text><text start="665.44" dur="4.16">we we still need to figure out</text><text start="667.76" dur="3.44">like whenever you try to when you think</text><text start="669.6" dur="2.799">of</text><text start="671.2" dur="4.0">of um</text><text start="672.399" dur="5.361">changing systems of systemic change</text><text start="675.2" dur="4.639">right you have like one way that is like</text><text start="677.76" dur="4.0">okay let&apos;s overthrow the existing system</text><text start="679.839" dur="4.321">and build a new one right on the ashes</text><text start="681.76" dur="3.92">of what we brought down like revolution</text><text start="684.16" dur="3.119">i&apos;m like sure you can you know try and</text><text start="685.68" dur="3.279">do that but once you open the gates of</text><text start="687.279" dur="4.961">hell no one knows what&apos;s gonna come out</text><text start="688.959" dur="5.201">right um so the other option is like</text><text start="692.24" dur="3.52">what open connective is kind of</text><text start="694.16" dur="3.52">semi-doing that it&apos;s like we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="695.76" dur="3.68">hack this freaking system and we&apos;re</text><text start="697.68" dur="3.68">gonna kind of operate in a way that we</text><text start="699.44" dur="3.76">look like something that they are used</text><text start="701.36" dur="4.0">to seeing but we&apos;re actually doing all</text><text start="703.2" dur="4.56">of this you know enabling all of this</text><text start="705.36" dur="4.719">amazingness on the side right</text><text start="707.76" dur="4.079">and then there is a third way that it&apos;s</text><text start="710.079" dur="3.921">where i want to go to which is where</text><text start="711.839" dur="3.601">davos are which is like okay all of</text><text start="714.0" dur="5.279">these we&apos;re gonna build an alternative</text><text start="715.44" dur="6.48">system and you know escape this system</text><text start="719.279" dur="4.8">right like jump over it like leapfrog</text><text start="721.92" dur="4.24">that which is what does is doing and</text><text start="724.079" dur="4.56">that for me has an amazing appeal right</text><text start="726.16" dur="5.52">because it&apos;s like it has this</text><text start="728.639" dur="4.88">um it articulates an alternative in a</text><text start="731.68" dur="3.2">way that is very clear right you have</text><text start="733.519" dur="2.961">your own currency you have your own</text><text start="734.88" dur="3.6">regulations you have your own governance</text><text start="736.48" dur="5.359">you have your own voting system like you</text><text start="738.48" dur="5.28">have your thing you know it looks like</text><text start="741.839" dur="3.68">an alternative like it smells like an</text><text start="743.76" dur="3.199">alternative it&apos;s clear it separates and</text><text start="745.519" dur="3.76">i love that</text><text start="746.959" dur="3.68">and that excites me a lot but</text><text start="749.279" dur="3.201">what</text><text start="750.639" dur="2.961">what we&apos;re missing is like bridges</text><text start="752.48" dur="3.2">between</text><text start="753.6" dur="4.239">the worlds right what we&apos;re missing is</text><text start="755.68" dur="4.159">like a path where we can start moving</text><text start="757.839" dur="4.081">people over from this system to the</text><text start="759.839" dur="4.161">other one because if not like the new</text><text start="761.92" dur="3.919">system is gonna be like a niche system</text><text start="764.0" dur="5.04">right and you&apos;re not gonna accomplish</text><text start="765.839" dur="4.961">like our goal of um</text><text start="769.04" dur="3.52">really building an alternative because</text><text start="770.8" dur="3.68">unless you have people</text><text start="772.56" dur="3.68">using that alternative then it&apos;s not</text><text start="774.48" dur="4.32">really a new system right</text><text start="776.24" dur="4.24">um and so</text><text start="778.8" dur="4.0">i think that we still have a lot of work</text><text start="780.48" dur="5.039">to do that and that looks like you know</text><text start="782.8" dur="5.839">better onboarding and usability and like</text><text start="785.519" dur="5.12">lowering you know the cognitive leap</text><text start="788.639" dur="4.241">that you need to make in order to use it</text><text start="790.639" dur="5.2">and everything that we already know but</text><text start="792.88" dur="6.16">it also has to at some point connect</text><text start="795.839" dur="4.881">somehow with what it exists so i&apos;ve been</text><text start="799.04" dur="3.2">talking too many dolls about this</text><text start="800.72" dur="3.84">because they are all</text><text start="802.24" dur="4.08">many dolls are like or for example</text><text start="804.56" dur="4.16">developers that work for those they&apos;re</text><text start="806.32" dur="5.199">asking me like okay i still need a pay</text><text start="808.72" dur="4.88">stub for my landlord you know i still</text><text start="811.519" dur="5.44">need to be able to produce and invoice</text><text start="813.6" dur="5.52">someone how how on earth do i show</text><text start="816.959" dur="3.361">income if everything is like</text><text start="819.12" dur="2.64">you know</text><text start="820.32" dur="2.639">in this</text><text start="821.76" dur="3.519">i don&apos;t know</text><text start="822.959" dur="4.161">in kraken right like how do you prove to</text><text start="825.279" dur="3.601">your landlord that you can pay your rent</text><text start="827.12" dur="3.279">you know if you have all your money in</text><text start="828.88" dur="4.72">kraken and it&apos;s very difficult but</text><text start="830.399" dur="5.68">they&apos;re very concrete needs right so</text><text start="833.6" dur="4.96">you know i think that we open collective</text><text start="836.079" dur="5.12">needs to move more towards the future</text><text start="838.56" dur="5.04">and then but dallas also need to</text><text start="841.199" dur="4.561">start thinking about what links they</text><text start="843.6" dur="5.039">need to the existing system and how we</text><text start="845.76" dur="5.04">build them in a way that we&apos;re not</text><text start="848.639" dur="5.44">you know centralizing but at the same</text><text start="850.8" dur="6.32">time we can actually use it right</text><text start="854.079" dur="4.641">that&apos;s where i see it amazing</text><text start="857.12" dur="4.079">uh what a beautiful answer and i think</text><text start="858.72" dur="4.799">that you have so much alpha having run</text><text start="861.199" dur="3.521">open collective for all these years in</text><text start="863.519" dur="3.841">helping</text><text start="864.72" dur="5.04">helping these open source communities</text><text start="867.36" dur="3.839">uh operate in a non-hierarchical way</text><text start="869.76" dur="2.48">operate in a way in which you&apos;re</text><text start="871.199" dur="3.921">building a</text><text start="872.24" dur="4.64">a wedge into the old system and i think</text><text start="875.12" dur="4.32">what i heard from you is that you can go</text><text start="876.88" dur="5.6">the sort of like revolution</text><text start="879.44" dur="4.959">angle or you can go the enablement on</text><text start="882.48" dur="3.599">top of the existing system angle and i</text><text start="884.399" dur="3.361">think the open collective it sounds like</text><text start="886.079" dur="3.041">it&apos;s maybe kind of a bridge between the</text><text start="887.76" dur="2.879">two i don&apos;t want to put words in your</text><text start="889.12" dur="3.04">mouth</text><text start="890.639" dur="3.76">yeah i think that open collective is</text><text start="892.16" dur="4.0">like it&apos;s definitely sitting in we&apos;re</text><text start="894.399" dur="4.081">gonna build on top of the existing</text><text start="896.16" dur="4.479">system and abstract it as much as we can</text><text start="898.48" dur="4.32">and then those are very much in the this</text><text start="900.639" dur="4.32">is an alternative and we don&apos;t even talk</text><text start="902.8" dur="4.719">to the existing system right</text><text start="904.959" dur="4.88">and so i think we need to come closer</text><text start="907.519" dur="5.041">together in building those bridges</text><text start="909.839" dur="4.24">because i think that a lot of the that&apos;s</text><text start="912.56" dur="2.8">how we&apos;re going to pull people over</text><text start="914.079" dur="2.56">right that&apos;s how we&apos;re going to bring</text><text start="915.36" dur="3.599">folks to</text><text start="916.639" dur="4.88">a more decentralized kind of</text><text start="918.959" dur="3.921">future do you have any sort of alpha or</text><text start="921.519" dur="3.361">insights on</text><text start="922.88" dur="3.28">how these non-hierarchical communities</text><text start="924.88" dur="2.959">have worked and have governed themselves</text><text start="926.16" dur="3.28">on open open collective i know that</text><text start="927.839" dur="3.601">y&apos;all are very transparent about</text><text start="929.44" dur="4.079">spending which is something that the old</text><text start="931.44" dur="4.0">fiat system doesn&apos;t have but blockchain</text><text start="933.519" dur="4.32">systems have i know that you&apos;ve got an</text><text start="935.44" dur="4.56">ethos of democratic and distributed</text><text start="937.839" dur="4.24">network governance at open collective is</text><text start="940.0" dur="4.079">there anything you&apos;ve observed on the on</text><text start="942.079" dur="5.12">open collective that&apos;s alpha for people</text><text start="944.079" dur="5.841">who are running dowels at all</text><text start="947.199" dur="4.08">yeah i think and this is related to like</text><text start="949.92" dur="3.359">the second comment i wanted to make</text><text start="951.279" dur="3.68">about dallas that is like</text><text start="953.279" dur="5.12">whether it&apos;s on dallas or open</text><text start="954.959" dur="5.521">collective or like traditional system</text><text start="958.399" dur="4.88">the problems are human and they&apos;re the</text><text start="960.48" dur="4.799">same right participation is a problem</text><text start="963.279" dur="3.761">for everyone dolls</text><text start="965.279" dur="4.24">democracy collective whatever you call</text><text start="967.04" dur="3.68">it right because it has to do with</text><text start="969.519" dur="4.081">um</text><text start="970.72" dur="5.28">our as human beings our challenges right</text><text start="973.6" dur="3.2">to participating and to engaging</text><text start="976.0" dur="2.399">um</text><text start="976.8" dur="4.8">so</text><text start="978.399" dur="5.601">so i think that we need to be</text><text start="981.6" dur="4.159">we need to be super aware that</text><text start="984.0" dur="3.839">i think the challenges are more cultural</text><text start="985.759" dur="3.601">than they are technical right in many</text><text start="987.839" dur="3.68">many spaces</text><text start="989.36" dur="4.0">and</text><text start="991.519" dur="3.921">a lot of folks don&apos;t end up</text><text start="993.36" dur="4.56">participating right so even if you have</text><text start="995.44" dur="4.88">like super liquid democracy quadratic</text><text start="997.92" dur="5.76">voting kind of setups and you&apos;re like</text><text start="1000.32" dur="5.36">but you can vote on this like more often</text><text start="1003.68" dur="3.92">than not folks won&apos;t vote right and</text><text start="1005.68" dur="5.12">there&apos;s a million reasons why and we can</text><text start="1007.6" dur="4.96">get into into all of this but um</text><text start="1010.8" dur="3.839">at the end of the day you&apos;ll have and it</text><text start="1012.56" dur="4.56">happens if you go to any freaking like</text><text start="1014.639" dur="4.32">assembly town hall assembly you&apos;re gonna</text><text start="1017.12" dur="4.639">have the same problem right and i have</text><text start="1018.959" dur="5.041">the same voices that are the loudest</text><text start="1021.759" dur="4.32">that are the ones with time that are the</text><text start="1024.0" dur="4.559">ones who have the opportunity to kind of</text><text start="1026.079" dur="3.681">be there and pester and get involved and</text><text start="1028.559" dur="2.24">vote right</text><text start="1029.76" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="1030.799" dur="3.681">and we see that happening in collectives</text><text start="1032.88" dur="3.36">we see that happening in dallas we see</text><text start="1034.48" dur="2.959">that happening in politics</text><text start="1036.24" dur="2.48">so i think it has to do with</text><text start="1037.439" dur="4.321">understanding</text><text start="1038.72" dur="5.04">drivers of participation um and i know</text><text start="1041.76" dur="2.96">that dao has been like</text><text start="1043.76" dur="3.36">you know</text><text start="1044.72" dur="4.48">playing or experimenting which i think</text><text start="1047.12" dur="4.4">is phenomenal right experimenting with</text><text start="1049.2" dur="4.32">like earn to play and to participate</text><text start="1051.52" dur="3.92">kind of you know</text><text start="1053.52" dur="3.44">models which i think must be</text><text start="1055.44" dur="4.08">experimented with</text><text start="1056.96" dur="4.24">but we still don&apos;t know the result of</text><text start="1059.52" dur="3.6">that right we still don&apos;t know like the</text><text start="1061.2" dur="4.719">long-term consequences for govern</text><text start="1063.12" dur="5.28">governance or for accountability or for</text><text start="1065.919" dur="3.361">concentration of power right</text><text start="1068.4" dur="2.399">um</text><text start="1069.28" dur="4.399">so</text><text start="1070.799" dur="4.321">so i think that my one kind of</text><text start="1073.679" dur="3.041">you know</text><text start="1075.12" dur="3.76">thing that i would say for folks</text><text start="1076.72" dur="4.72">involved in governance in dallas like</text><text start="1078.88" dur="4.88">really kind of i would approach the</text><text start="1081.44" dur="5.92">problem not as</text><text start="1083.76" dur="5.279">a design problem but as a</text><text start="1087.36" dur="3.52">very much as a cultural and human</text><text start="1089.039" dur="4.401">problem and and you know the news</text><text start="1090.88" dur="4.96">designed to you know optimize for that</text><text start="1093.44" dur="4.8">but if you just if you think it&apos;s only</text><text start="1095.84" dur="5.6">design we&apos;re just gonna you know do this</text><text start="1098.24" dur="5.92">fancy quadratic voting which again</text><text start="1101.44" dur="4.64">i love okay but what i&apos;m saying is like</text><text start="1104.16" dur="4.32">make sure that you&apos;re not forgetting</text><text start="1106.08" dur="3.92">that the folks you are you know that</text><text start="1108.48" dur="5.28">your units</text><text start="1110.0" dur="3.76">are human they&apos;re not addresses</text><text start="1115.36" dur="4.24">amazing</text><text start="1116.64" dur="4.48">yeah um i think that uh</text><text start="1119.6" dur="3.76">one of the things i sort of heard there</text><text start="1121.12" dur="4.4">is that you&apos;ve got the the mechanisms</text><text start="1123.36" dur="4.88">and you&apos;ve got the governance but don&apos;t</text><text start="1125.52" dur="4.399">sleep on culture uh and if if culture</text><text start="1128.24" dur="4.4">and the humanity</text><text start="1129.919" dur="3.921">gets away from you then no mechanism is</text><text start="1132.64" dur="2.399">gonna save</text><text start="1133.84" dur="2.88">i mean like</text><text start="1135.039" dur="3.841">what is how have you tried to design the</text><text start="1136.72" dur="3.68">culture around open collective i mean i</text><text start="1138.88" dur="3.28">i&apos;ve seen some of it from the outside</text><text start="1140.4" dur="3.84">i&apos;ve been to sustain web 3 educating</text><text start="1142.16" dur="5.2">people about the problem giving them the</text><text start="1144.24" dur="4.16">tools to solve it themselves but i guess</text><text start="1147.36" dur="2.8">i want to keep pulling that thread</text><text start="1148.4" dur="3.279">whereas where&apos;s the cultural alpha what</text><text start="1150.16" dur="3.759">should dao leaders be doing with with</text><text start="1151.679" dur="5.201">their culture</text><text start="1153.919" dur="4.721">yeah totally so for example in open</text><text start="1156.88" dur="3.36">collective foundation that now we&apos;re</text><text start="1158.64" dur="3.6">working very strongly in a solidarity</text><text start="1160.24" dur="4.64">economy we have a solidarity economy</text><text start="1162.24" dur="5.6">school we have a

know to</text><text start="1170.799" dur="5.12">involve folks in thinking about</text><text start="1173.12" dur="6.16">solidarity economy in thinking about</text><text start="1175.919" dur="6.88">like

start="1334.64" dur="3.44">that you know we want to do with open</text><text start="1336.4" dur="3.279">collectives kind of future like the</text><text start="1338.08" dur="3.839">platform&apos;s future</text><text start="1339.679" dur="2.24">and</text><text start="1342.48" dur="7.76">my kind of my main kind of focus or</text><text start="1346.159" dur="6.081">concern beyond kind of the transaction</text><text start="1350.24" dur="4.4">has to do with how on earth do we train</text><text start="1352.24" dur="4.4">our community to own</text><text start="1354.64" dur="4.159">and manage something like open</text><text start="1356.64" dur="4.48">collective right because i don&apos;t want to</text><text start="1358.799" dur="4.801">turn around in two years and say like</text><text start="1361.12" dur="5.439">okay folks this is yours bye have fun</text><text start="1363.6" dur="5.079">right and but never trained them on how</text><text start="1366.559" dur="4.961">to manage something like a</text><text start="1368.679" dur="5.961">community-owned piece of infrastructure</text><text start="1371.52" dur="5.68">um and so that&apos;s kind of what</text><text start="1374.64" dur="4.8">um referendums do referendums in</text><text start="1377.2" dur="4.16">politics are kind of this really blunt</text><text start="1379.44" dur="4.64">instrument of democracy</text><text start="1381.36" dur="3.92">that politicians can decide on something</text><text start="1384.08" dur="3.2">and they&apos;re like oh we&apos;re just gonna</text><text start="1385.28" dur="4.32">throw it to the people they can decide</text><text start="1387.28" dur="4.48">it&apos;s like should we say or should we go</text><text start="1389.6" dur="4.48">vote right</text><text start="1391.76" dur="4.0">and that&apos;s not how it works you know</text><text start="1394.08" dur="4.8">we&apos;ve never trained people into deciding</text><text start="1395.76" dur="6.159">you&apos;ve never had like build up to that</text><text start="1398.88" dur="4.799">and so for me the core of everything</text><text start="1401.919" dur="5.12">that we&apos;re doing is how do we get</text><text start="1403.679" dur="5.441">communities up to speed with governing</text><text start="1407.039" dur="4.88">and being kind of</text><text start="1409.12" dur="5.36">themselves the ultimately

start="1415.919" dur="5.36">makers like that or at least not in our</text><text start="1418.159" dur="5.76">space and so that&apos;s what we want to do</text><text start="1421.279" dur="5.041">beautiful yeah i think that the the</text><text start="1423.919" dur="4.161">alpha that i get from that is that</text><text start="1426.32" dur="3.92">it&apos;s not a technology problem which</text><text start="1428.08" dur="4.56">depresses me as a software engineer but</text><text start="1430.24" dur="4.88">it sounds like it&apos;s a cultural problem</text><text start="1432.64"

start="1438.559" dur="3.441">and then basically</text><text start="1440.799" dur="3.601">i want to pull on the thread of your</text><text start="1442.0" dur="4.24">exit to community

reason we did is like we</text><text start="1580.4" dur="3.519">know that open collective is not going</text><text start="1581.84" dur="4.24">to happen overnight and so if you want</text><text

dur="3.28">they&apos;ve been</text><text start="1594.48" dur="4.16">nothing but supportive and so we are in</text><text start="1596.64" dur="4.399">this kind of super unique position where</text><text

start="1614.96" dur="3.599">thinking about the future of open</text><text start="1616.4" dur="3.92">collective and i said this before but i</text><text start="1618.559" dur="3.36">i really want to make myself redundant</text><text start="1620.32" dur="4.0">here because i think that a successful</text><text start="1621.919" dur="3.921">mission survived it survives its funders</text><text

dur="3.279">thinking about that</text><text start="1636.64" dur="5.039">like what are our options for for a</text><text start="1638.399" dur="5.921">startup like ours we can sell right or</text><text

dur="6.159">and so none of those options are</text><text start="1655.84" dur="3.839">an option for us you know we don&apos;t want</text><text start="1658.399" dur="2.88">to sell because selling doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1659.679" dur="3.681">guarantee that you can protect your</text><text start="1661.279" dur="4.561">mission and we&apos;re definitely not in a</text><text

thinking about that like exit</text><text start="1678.799" dur="4.0">to community seems like the right option</text><text start="1681.12" dur="4.08">for us now what does it mean exit to</text><text

dur="4.319">systems of the internet generation can</text><text start="2504.96" dur="3.6">you tell us a little bit about that</text><text start="2507.119" dur="3.041">about that philosophy</text><text start="2508.56" dur="5.759">yeah that i still believe that</text><text start="2510.16" dur="7.199">wholeheartedly um yeah i i think that um</text><text start="2514.319" dur="4.321">our political institutions and</text><text start="2517.359" dur="3.921">so economic</text><text start="2518.64" dur="4.4">institutions in general like democracies</text><text start="2521.28" dur="3.839">you know political institutions economic</text><text start="2523.04" dur="4.799">institutions they&apos;re not generally</text><text start="2525.119" dur="5.281">created in the void they respond to a</text><text start="2527.839" dur="4.721">certain society to a certain technology</text><text start="2530.4" dur="3.919">to a certain education and access to</text><text start="2532.56" dur="4.48">education that</text><text start="2534.319" dur="4.241">was there when they were created right</text><text start="2537.04" dur="3.6">so if you think about it like having</text><text start="2538.56" dur="4.559">representative democracy for example</text><text start="2540.64" dur="4.24">it&apos;s like a brilliant idea when your</text><text start="2543.119" dur="4.0">means of communication is like pen and</text><text start="2544.88" dur="4.239">paper and a horse of course you don&apos;t</text><text start="2547.119" dur="3.281">want everyone in the room because they</text><text start="2549.119" dur="2.72">can&apos;t physically live in the room</text><text start="2550.4" dur="2.719">because they can&apos;t get to the room and</text><text start="2551.839"

so</text><text start="2559.04" dur="3.6">we can all be in the room now we can all</text><text start="2561.04" dur="2.799">have access to the resources we need to</text><text start="2562.64" dur="3.36">make this decision we can all</text><text start="2563.839" dur="3.921">participate but we&apos;re still being</text><text start="2566.0" dur="3.839">excluded we&apos;re still</text><text

dur="4.16">instead of being active participants of</text><text start="2574.96" dur="4.56">our dialogue and that generates a lot of</text><text start="2577.04" dur="4.64">frustration it generates a lot of noise</text><text start="2579.52" dur="4.24">and a lot of silence in the system it</text><text start="2581.68" dur="3.52">generates like when things go bad people</text><text start="2583.76" dur="3.359">go out on the street in a very</text><text start="2585.2" dur="4.0">non-constructive way because that&apos;s</text><text start="2587.119" dur="4.72">noise right because that&apos;s their only</text><text start="2589.2" dur="4.399">option but also most of the times</text><text start="2591.839" dur="4.161">they&apos;re just quiet and they don&apos;t want</text><text start="2593.599"

dur="3.919">like that&apos;s what this system is intended</text><text start="2601.119" dur="2.881">to do for everyone to be a pathetic and</text><text start="2603.119" dur="2.24">go</text><text

start="2608.52" dur="5.24">self-perpetuate right right it&apos;s</text><text start="2610.88" dur="4.239">exclusive so i think that we citizens</text><text start="2613.76" dur="2.559">are you know</text><text start="2615.119" dur="4.0">now</text><text start="2616.319" dur="4.961">in this situation where society moved</text><text start="2619.119" dur="3.761">forward to a place where we can</text><text start="2621.28" dur="2.96">represent ourselves but we&apos;re still</text><text start="2622.88" dur="2.64">stuck with institutions that were</text><text start="2624.24" dur="3.359">designed in a time where we couldn&apos;t</text><text start="2625.52" dur="4.16">represent ourselves and that is kind of</text><text start="2627.599" dur="3.681">the rift that we are seeing</text><text start="2629.68" dur="4.639">and it&apos;s not going to get better until</text><text start="2631.28" dur="4.4">we design institutions for this society</text><text start="2634.319" dur="3.04">right and i think going back to maybe</text><text start="2635.68" dur="2.96">one of your earlier points there&apos;s the</text><text start="2637.359" dur="3.681">culture of</text><text start="2638.64" dur="3.84">oh wait i&apos;ve got a vote now but you know</text><text start="2641.04" dur="3.44">we so we can build the technology of</text><text start="2642.48" dur="4.24">high resolution democracy and preference</text><text start="2644.48" dur="4.0">expression but there&apos;s also the culture</text><text start="2646.72" dur="3.52">of asserting yourself and asserting a</text><text start="2648.48" dur="3.44">vision and expressing your preferences</text><text start="2650.24" dur="3.28">that i think needs to be built as well</text><text start="2651.92" dur="2.88">is is that a fair</text><text start="2653.52" dur="3.36">yeah</text><text start="2654.8" dur="3.84">we need to experience participation in</text><text start="2656.88" dur="2.959">order to and we need to learn how to</text><text start="2658.64" dur="3.52">fail</text><text start="2659.839" dur="4.641">right we need to we need to do it and</text><text start="2662.16" dur="4.8">fail and learn from it and fail failing</text><text start="2664.48" dur="5.2">should be okay until failing until we</text><text start="2666.96" dur="4.48">have like real stakes things decisions</text><text start="2669.68" dur="4.0">and we fail at them we&apos;re not gonna</text><text start="2671.44" dur="4.159">learn from them right so</text><text start="2673.68" dur="4.72">um we need to design kind of those</text><text start="2675.599" dur="5.121">spaces where we can fail at governance</text><text start="2678.4" dur="4.48">in a way that is more or less controlled</text><text start="2680.72" dur="3.44">or more or less contained</text><text start="2682.88" dur="3.28">so we can learn</text><text start="2684.16" dur="4.72">right so higher stakes we are already</text><text start="2686.16" dur="3.52">better trained to do so</text><text start="2688.88" dur="2.4">great</text><text start="2689.68" dur="3.2">does this quote that i found when i was</text><text start="2691.28" dur="3.68">doing my research on you political</text><text start="2692.88" dur="4.16">action is being able to move from uh</text><text start="2694.96" dur="4.24">agitation to construction</text><text

for</text><text start="2725.839" dur="4.081">everyone because we would tweet</text><text start="2727.68" dur="3.76">and</text><text start="2729.92" dur="3.36">you know i think that</text><text start="2731.44" dur="3.76">we missed we missed a lot of things</text><text start="2733.28" dur="4.4">there but we were trying to do was like</text><text start="2735.2" dur="5.119">be against something we&apos;re against this</text><text start="2737.68" dur="4.72">system right now occupy wall street you</text><text start="2740.319" dur="4.961">know we&apos;re against one percent like we</text><text

so that&apos;s what i meant about</text><text start="2754.319" dur="4.481">moving from agitation to construction we</text><text start="2756.079" dur="4.0">need to not only be against something we</text><text start="2758.8" dur="2.24">need to know what we want to build</text><text start="2760.079" dur="2.641">instead</text><text start="2761.04" dur="4.48">and until we figure that out that
