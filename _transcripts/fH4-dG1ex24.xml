episode for a while</text><text start="191.76" dur="3.28">and i&apos;m really excited to talk about</text><text start="193.2" dur="3.92">panvala uh can you tell me how you got</text><text

start="200.64" dur="4.0">started with bitcoin as it probably did</text><text start="202.159" dur="5.281">for most people uh the digital gold</text><text start="204.64" dur="4.239">narrative is a pretty strong one uh so</text><text start="207.44" dur="2.719">like that&apos;s what got me interested in</text><text start="208.879" dur="3.36">the first place it&apos;s like hey here&apos;s</text><text start="210.159" dur="4.561">this new currency that maybe a lot of</text><text start="212.239" dur="5.041">things could run on uh eventually i</text><text start="214.72" dur="4.4">heard of ethereum these people who were</text><text start="217.28" dur="3.84">trying to put a programming language</text><text start="219.12" dur="3.759">into their currency</text><text start="221.12" dur="3.119">and it sounded like a scam point to me</text><text start="222.879" dur="2.72">not gonna lie it&apos;s like why do you need</text><text start="224.239" dur="2.481">a programming language in your currency</text><text start="225.599" dur="3.28">how&apos;s that going to make the currency</text><text start="226.72" dur="3.28">more useful or valuable didn&apos;t make any</text><text start="228.879" dur="2.481">sense</text><text start="230.0" dur="3.2">when it clicked for me it was when i</text><text start="231.36" dur="3.84">started contributing to an open source</text><text start="233.2" dur="4.08">project called auger a prediction market</text><text start="235.2" dur="3.92">platform i was excited about prediction</text><text start="237.28" dur="3.599">markets at the time not really even</text><text start="239.12" dur="2.96">ethereum i was like hey decentralized</text><text start="240.879" dur="2.64">prediction markets that&apos;s where the</text><text start="242.08" dur="3.2">value is that i want to go build</text><text start="243.519" dur="4.0">something like that so i started</text><text start="245.28" dur="3.84">contributing as a volunteer contributor</text><text start="247.519" dur="3.28">and they happened to be using ethereum</text><text start="249.12" dur="3.199">behind the scenes and i was actually</text><text start="250.799" dur="3.761">contributing to that project that made</text><text start="252.319" dur="4.48">it clear to me what it meant to have a</text><text start="254.56" dur="3.76">programming language in your money it</text><text start="256.799" dur="3.921">means that you can kind of write the</text><text start="258.32" dur="4.72">rules for any interaction between</text><text start="260.72" dur="3.759">individuals or groups of people write</text><text start="263.04" dur="2.48">down the rules like it&apos;s the rules to a</text><text start="264.479" dur="3.201">board game</text><text start="265.52" dur="3.76">and instead of needing some sort of game</text><text start="267.68" dur="3.84">master to enforce the rules of your</text><text start="269.28" dur="3.68">board game the ethereum network is a</text><text start="271.52" dur="3.36">network of thousands of computers that</text><text start="272.96" dur="4.72">promises to be the game master for any</text><text start="274.88" dur="4.24">game any social or economic interaction</text><text start="277.68" dur="3.68">that you come up with</text><text start="279.12" dur="3.84">so if you can think of any better way</text><text start="281.36" dur="3.36">for people to cooperate with one another</text><text start="282.96" dur="3.6">and get stuff done than the way we</text><text start="284.72" dur="4.0">currently do things in our society you</text><text start="286.56" dur="4.32">can literally come up with those rules</text><text start="288.72" dur="3.759">publish them to the blockchain and tell</text><text start="290.88" dur="3.599">people hey here&apos;s a new way we can work</text><text start="292.479" dur="3.521">together i want you to do this with me</text><text start="294.479" dur="4.481">and if they like it they don&apos;t need to</text><text start="296.0" dur="4.8">rely on anyone ever again uh so at that</text><text start="298.96" dur="3.76">point once that light bulb went off i</text><text start="300.8" dur="4.16">quit my job i tried to find a way to</text><text start="302.72" dur="4.319">work in ethereum full time and i came</text><text start="304.96" dur="3.36">across consensus</text><text start="307.039" dur="2.72">so i started working at consensus</text><text start="308.32" dur="3.36">consensus is actually where i founded</text><text start="309.759" dur="3.521">panvala i started doing security</text><text start="311.68" dur="3.04">auditing work and working on some other</text><text start="313.28" dur="3.199">prediction market stuff a couple</text><text start="314.72" dur="3.759">different projects here and there but</text><text start="316.479" dur="3.041">the idea that i couldn&apos;t get out of my</text><text start="318.479" dur="2.641">head</text><text start="319.52" dur="3.519">was that if you have this toolkit for</text><text start="321.12" dur="3.04">social and economic coordination you</text><text start="323.039" dur="3.201">should probably be using it to solve the</text><text start="324.16" dur="4.479">hardest possible problem you can solve</text><text start="326.24" dur="4.72">and to me the hardest problem comes to</text><text start="328.639" dur="3.761">the stuff that we share like uh it&apos;s</text><text start="330.96" dur="2.88">very easy to organize around the stuff</text><text start="332.4" dur="3.519">that we don&apos;t share the stuff that just</text><text start="333.84" dur="4.16">benefits one person right like the</text><text start="335.919" dur="4.641">phones in our pocket have gotten better</text><text start="338.0" dur="4.479">at a dramatic rate because there&apos;s only</text><text start="340.56" dur="3.359">one person who benefits each time so</text><text start="342.479" dur="3.44">every company knows if i can make that</text><text start="343.919" dur="3.601">one person happier they will pay me more</text><text start="345.919" dur="4.641">money and then they will get a better</text><text start="347.52" dur="5.76">phone but imagine if a phone benefited</text><text start="350.56" dur="4.88">two people or five people or ten people</text><text start="353.28" dur="4.96">or millions of people imagine if all you</text><text start="355.44" dur="4.479">needed was one city phone</text><text start="358.24" dur="4.16">that everybody shared and it benefited</text><text start="359.919" dur="4.641">everybody like it would suck you would</text><text start="362.4" dur="4.239">have committees deciding what features</text><text start="364.56" dur="4.32">the phone has uh getting people to pay</text><text start="366.639" dur="4.161">for the city phone would really suck uh</text><text start="368.88" dur="3.2">trying to make a better city phone you</text><text start="370.8" dur="2.56">would you wouldn&apos;t be guaranteed that</text><text start="372.08" dur="3.28">anybody would buy it because you&apos;d have</text><text start="373.36" dur="4.8">to convince the whole city to bite it</text><text start="375.36" dur="4.399">would suck so that to me is the core</text><text start="378.16" dur="2.96">problem that&apos;s</text><text start="379.759" dur="3.361">hindering so much progress in our</text><text start="381.12" dur="3.12">society we&apos;re very good at organizing</text><text start="383.12" dur="3.359">around the stuff that benefits one</text><text start="384.24" dur="4.239">person but once it benefits many people</text><text start="386.479" dur="3.921">we suck at it we have governments which</text><text start="388.479" dur="4.16">solve a lot of problems but they&apos;re just</text><text start="390.4" dur="3.84">not that great so if we can find better</text><text start="392.639" dur="3.921">solutions to organize the stuff that we</text><text start="394.24" dur="4.079">share we&apos;re all going to be happier so i</text><text start="396.56" dur="4.079">started building some things that looked</text><text start="398.319" dur="4.72">like decentralized non-profits and pan</text><text start="400.639" dur="4.321">bala was really the third in that series</text><text start="403.039" dur="3.761">of prototypes the one that felt like it</text><text start="404.96" dur="3.84">had the most lugs to me</text><text start="406.8" dur="4.16">and what it really is is a network of</text><text start="408.8" dur="4.08">communities that work together to push</text><text start="410.96" dur="4.16">more resources to every community in the</text><text start="412.88" dur="5.12">network using our shared endowment and</text><text start="415.12" dur="5.44">the collective action that we take uh to</text><text start="418.0" dur="4.0">drive value into that endowment</text><text start="420.56" dur="3.68">so that&apos;s really the story of how it all</text><text start="422.0" dur="3.599">got started uh but there&apos;s more i can</text><text start="424.24" dur="4.079">dive into</text><text start="425.599" dur="4.961">nice amazing um i love how you framed</text><text start="428.319" dur="4.641">that you know like we&apos;ve got this</text><text start="430.56" dur="3.919">programmable money and we&apos;ve got these</text><text start="432.96" dur="3.76">network that&apos;s built on top of maybe we</text><text start="434.479" dur="3.041">should start the solve the most hard</text><text start="436.72" dur="2.72">thing</text><text start="437.52" dur="3.36">possible using that and that&apos;s the</text><text start="439.44" dur="4.0">things that we share like that just</text><text start="440.88" dur="4.48">follows from first principles for me and</text><text start="443.44" dur="3.44">from watching your shelling point talk</text><text start="445.36" dur="4.559">in order to prep for this i know that</text><text start="446.88" dur="5.039">you talked a lot about collective action</text><text start="449.919" dur="3.521">and how creating collective action is</text><text start="451.919" dur="3.441">one of the things that you&apos;re most</text><text start="453.44" dur="3.52">passionate about um</text><text start="455.36" dur="4.32">would you say that sort of fits into the</text><text start="456.96" dur="5.76">theme of solving for our shared needs</text><text start="459.68" dur="4.639">absolutely like uh again so like a lot</text><text start="462.72" dur="3.36">of people when i talk about the kind of</text><text start="464.319" dur="3.6">work that i want to get done with crypto</text><text start="466.08" dur="4.72">they assume that i&apos;m some sort of</text><text start="467.919" dur="5.361">do-gooder and i think i&apos;m generally a</text><text start="470.8" dur="4.239">good person but i do not identify as a</text><text start="473.28" dur="3.599">do-gooder at all i identify as a</text><text start="475.039" dur="3.361">pragmatist i want to do the best that&apos;s</text><text start="476.879" dur="3.44">possible given the constraints of the</text><text start="478.4" dur="3.68">world that we live in like i am not</text><text start="480.319" dur="4.16">trying to make anything wild and crazy</text><text start="482.08" dur="4.959">happen like just like what is the best</text><text start="484.479" dur="5.521">possible world we can live in is</text><text start="487.039" dur="4.961">kind of how i orient my thinking and</text><text start="490.0" dur="4.639">i don&apos;t actually think that i&apos;m making</text><text start="492.0" dur="4.319">any sacrifice by working on the problems</text><text start="494.639" dur="3.12">that i think benefit the most people</text><text start="496.319" dur="3.121">like i think when the story is written</text><text start="497.759" dur="3.681">of what happens in crypto like the</text><text start="499.44" dur="3.92">people who end up with the most</text><text start="501.44" dur="3.52">resources are going to be the people who</text><text start="503.36" dur="3.04">drove the most value to the most people</text><text start="504.96" dur="2.959">possible so</text><text start="506.4" dur="4.16">literally the work that i&apos;m doing is</text><text start="507.919" dur="5.04">kind of selfish like i think it&apos;s the i</text><text start="510.56" dur="4.32">think if it succeeds that</text><text start="512.959" dur="4.64">it will be good for me but i also think</text><text start="514.88" dur="4.88">that it&apos;ll be good for many many people</text><text start="517.599" dur="4.721">so like that that&apos;s where the collective</text><text start="519.76" dur="5.84">action really comes in like for this to</text><text start="522.32" dur="5.12">work like it&apos;s not about some sort of um</text><text start="525.6" dur="4.32">technology that magically solves your</text><text start="527.44" dur="3.44">problems for you like what i think we</text><text start="529.92" dur="3.599">can do</text><text start="530.88" dur="4.399">is like harness power that you&apos;ve always</text><text start="533.519" dur="4.401">had since day one</text><text start="535.279" dur="4.321">well that is like uh there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="537.92" dur="4.4">people who see</text><text start="539.6" dur="5.04">the the society we live in as one where</text><text start="542.32" dur="4.639">they can&apos;t actually make that big of an</text><text start="544.64" dur="3.84">impact on their own like there&apos;s a world</text><text start="546.959" dur="3.44">that they want to live in the way that</text><text start="548.48" dur="3.84">they want to change the world but our</text><text start="550.399" dur="4.0">society is very rigid</text><text start="552.32" dur="4.32">like we we&apos;re in a real sense a very</text><text start="554.399" dur="4.721">free society but we&apos;re not a society</text><text start="556.64" dur="3.84">with a ton of agency right like you can</text><text start="559.12" dur="2.719">people will

of</text><text start="646.64" dur="4.72">them today are crypto communities open</text><text start="648.959" dur="4.241">source projects dows like the easiest</text><text start="651.36" dur="3.2">people to organize right now are crypto</text><text start="653.2" dur="3.04">people because they&apos;re excited about</text><text start="654.56" dur="3.68">joining new things and the way that they</text><text start="656.24" dur="3.599">organize is without and open source</text><text start="658.24" dur="3.039">projects so those are the easiest</text><text start="659.839" dur="3.68">communities to plug into the network</text><text start="661.279" dur="4.721">right now the vision again is for every</text><text start="663.519" dur="3.76">single community on earth like i

we&apos;re going</text><text start="690.16" dur="2.96">through</text><text start="690.959" dur="3.921">so the way that we actually drive</text><text start="693.12" dur="4.48">resources to the communities in our</text><text start="694.88" dur="3.92">network is through what we call panwalla</text><text start="697.6" dur="4.16">stamps</text><text start="698.8" dur="4.479">so what panvellis stamps are are nfts</text><text start="701.76" dur="2.8">that fund your community when you</text><text start="703.279" dur="3.041">collect them</text><text start="704.56" dur="3.839">you can claim these stamps anytime you</text><text start="706.32" dur="4.72">make a purchase or you complete an</text><text start="708.399" dur="4.641">action that a sponsor has set up for you</text><text start="711.04" dur="3.919">and then once you claim that stamp you</text><text start="713.04" dur="3.84">can redeem it with any community you</text><text start="714.959" dur="3.841">want that can be one of the 82</text><text start="716.88" dur="4.639">communities that are in pan bala today</text><text start="718.8" dur="4.64">or it could be any community you want uh</text><text start="721.519" dur="3.841">us to help you plug into the network</text><text start="723.44" dur="4.16">because again this is for everybody it&apos;s</text><text start="725.36" dur="4.32">for all communities like we want you to</text><text start="727.6" dur="4.239">be a part of this movement</text><text start="729.68" dur="3.8">so uh there are three stamps that are</text><text start="731.839" dur="3.761">live right now at</text><text start="733.48" dur="3.799">panbala.com so depending on when you see</text><text start="735.6" dur="3.76">this it might be the same it might be</text><text start="737.279" dur="3.601">some new ones because again uh there&apos;s</text><text start="739.36" dur="3.84">gonna be tons and tons of stamp</text><text start="740.88" dur="4.48">campaigns these are the first three so</text><text start="743.2" dur="3.52">the first one is from index co-op and</text><text start="745.36" dur="3.68">what they want you to do to collect</text><text start="746.72" dur="4.559">their nft that&apos;s worth three dollars for</text><text start="749.04" dur="5.44">any community you choose is to either</text><text start="751.279" dur="5.36">subscribe to the to their uh

you get a stamp</text><text start="760.399" dur="3.761">that&apos;s an nft that&apos;s worth three dollars</text><text start="762.399" dur="4.081">you choose which community you want to</text><text start="764.16" dur="4.32">fund with that three dollars</text><text start="766.48" dur="4.0">right now the most popular community to</text><text start="768.48" dur="3.919">fund well with these stamps is actually</text><text start="770.48" dur="4.159">get coin itself so those will go to the</text><text start="772.399" dur="4.88">matching pool and help people find more</text><text start="774.639" dur="4.64">stuff there uh colonel is also fairly</text><text start="777.279" dur="4.0">high up the list uh but again any kind</text><text start="779.279" dur="4.24">of community uh we we hope that the</text><text start="781.279" dur="3.761">bankless community eventually joins and</text><text start="783.519" dur="3.12">starts collecting stamps to fund what</text><text start="785.04" dur="3.28">bankless does as well because we think</text><text start="786.639" dur="3.2">it&apos;s important work and again it&apos;s for</text><text start="788.32" dur="3.519">any kind of community</text><text start="789.839" dur="4.161">there&apos;s also two campaigns that opelus</text><text start="791.839" dur="4.56">is running right now for basically uh</text><text start="794.0" dur="4.44">referring people to join opolis if you</text><text start="796.399" dur="4.88">refer one person you get a stamp worth</text><text start="798.44" dur="4.36">5.28 cents if you refer five

dur="4.961">they&apos;re very uh uh big on the 5280 meme</text><text start="808.16" dur="3.44">uh so that&apos;s what&apos;s going on behind the</text><text start="809.92" dur="2.88">scenes colorado</text><text start="811.6" dur="3.359">yeah</text><text start="812.8" dur="3.92">so again these are nfts they live in</text><text start="814.959" dur="3.12">your wallet you get the redeemed version</text><text start="816.72" dur="2.72">of them and then the community you</text><text start="818.079" dur="2.801">choose gets the one that&apos;s actually</text><text start="819.44" dur="3.36">worth money and then they get to</text><text start="820.88" dur="4.16">withdraw those funds from pandola&apos;s</text><text start="822.8" dur="4.08">endowment to fund again whatever it is</text><text start="825.04" dur="3.52">that community does we&apos;re not trying to</text><text start="826.88" dur="3.84">change the world in a way that we</text><text start="828.56" dur="3.839">foresee we want to give you the agency</text><text start="830.72" dur="3.76">to change the world and the way you want</text><text start="832.399" dur="4.321">to see so collect stamps

want</text><text start="850.88" dur="4.48">wow amazing um</text><text start="853.92" dur="2.8">i think that there&apos;s just there&apos;s just</text><text start="855.36" dur="3.599">so much here and i can&apos;t decide which</text><text start="856.72" dur="4.72">thread to pull on uh feels like we&apos;re</text><text start="858.959" dur="4.961">kind of like trojan horsing some web 3</text><text start="861.44" dur="3.68">reputation into the world here as well</text><text start="863.92" dur="3.44">uh</text><text start="865.12" dur="4.32">there&apos;s a decentralized society</text><text start="867.36" dur="3.599">uh direction that all of this could go</text><text start="869.44" dur="2.72">once you have enough liquidity of these</text><text start="870.959" dur="4.081">stamps and i think that gets really</text><text start="872.16" dur="4.32">excited exciting um i don&apos;t know i guess</text><text start="875.04" dur="3.919">i&apos;ll maybe ask an open-ended question</text><text start="876.48" dur="4.56">what what gets you excited about this</text><text start="878.959" dur="4.481">community of communities and penn valley</text><text start="881.04" dur="3.919">stamps and you know</text><text start="883.44" dur="2.8">you know what gets you up and and gets</text><text start="884.959" dur="2.721">you like really excited about about</text><text start="886.24" dur="2.88">working on this</text><text start="887.68" dur="3.44">uh so the thing that gets me the most</text><text start="889.12" dur="4.24">excited is the world that i think we&apos;re</text><text start="891.12" dur="4.079">all building together both me you</text><text start="893.36" dur="4.0">everybody watching this like we&apos;re all</text><text start="895.199" dur="4.08">building something brand new and you can</text><text start="897.36" dur="3.76">feel weird new things happen every time</text><text start="899.279" dur="4.161">you go to a conference or every time you</text><text start="901.12" dur="4.719">see a new product launch but like what i</text><text start="903.44" dur="4.88">see happening is a dramatic shift of</text><text start="905.839" dur="3.601">resources to communities across our</text><text start="908.32" dur="2.959">society</text><text start="909.44" dur="4.24">and to me the main reason why that gets</text><text start="911.279" dur="4.161">me so excited is because again our</text><text start="913.68" dur="4.159">our society feels pretty rigid right now</text><text start="915.44" dur="4.959">like people are unhappy with tons of</text><text start="917.839" dur="4.881">things uh people want different visions</text><text start="920.399" dur="3.761">of the way our society works and i want</text><text start="922.72" dur="4.08">everybody to get as much of what they</text><text start="924.16" dur="4.0">want as possible like</text><text start="926.8" dur="2.8">there&apos;s probably things that you and i</text><text start="928.16" dur="3.52">disagree on things that the viewers and</text><text start="929.6" dur="4.239">i disagree on i don&apos;t care i want you to</text><text start="931.68" dur="4.32">get your way to the extent that that&apos;s</text><text start="933.839" dur="5.041">possible without infringing on what i</text><text start="936.0" dur="4.399">want and that&apos;s not really possible with</text><text start="938.88" dur="2.48">what&apos;s currently at the center of our</text><text start="940.399" dur="2.56">society</text><text start="941.36" dur="4.08">at the center of our society is</text><text start="942.959" dur="3.841">corporate life and political life and</text><text start="945.44" dur="2.88">corporate life is going to do whatever</text><text start="946.8" dur="3.12">is the most profitable you can&apos;t really</text><text start="948.32" dur="2.4">steer it on your own that much it&apos;s just</text><text start="949.92" dur="1.839">going to do whatever is the most</text><text start="950.72" dur="2.479">profitable</text><text start="951.759" dur="3.281">political life is going to do whatever</text><text start="953.199" dur="4.0">you can do to defeat your political</text><text start="955.04" dur="4.479">opponents like that&apos;s all that&apos;s all i</text><text start="957.199" dur="4.88">can do and it can&apos;t do that much</text><text start="959.519" dur="5.361">like with community life what&apos;s so</text><text start="962.079" dur="5.12">special about it is that you get your</text><text start="964.88" dur="4.8">way almost all of the time again there&apos;s</text><text start="967.199" dur="4.161">disputes within communities that happens</text><text start="969.68" dur="3.839">but literally you&apos;re choosing your own</text><text start="971.36" dur="3.839">community if you&apos;re so unhappy with your</text><text start="973.519" dur="2.721">own community you&apos;re going to choose a</text><text start="975.199" dur="3.601">different one</text><text start="976.24" dur="4.88">so like we can get much more of what</text><text start="978.8" dur="4.719">each and every one of us wants if we can</text><text start="981.12" dur="4.719">drive a dramatic amount of resources to</text><text start="983.519" dur="4.32">community life because again you get to</text><text start="985.839" dur="3.841">steer where those go you can solve the</text><text start="987.839" dur="3.521">problems that you see in our world you</text><text start="989.68" dur="2.8">can shape the world in the way you want</text><text start="991.36" dur="3.839">it to be</text><text start="992.48" dur="4.96">and again i think this can solve both</text><text start="995.199" dur="3.521">social problems that people see i think</text><text start="997.44" dur="3.36">this is the way that we&apos;re going to</text><text start="998.72" dur="2.88">solve climate change and that sounds</text><text start="1000.8" dur="2.399">like</text><text start="1001.6" dur="4.4">big and hand-wavy but i can go more in</text><text start="1003.199" dur="5.361">depth in that one as well i think</text><text start="1006.0" dur="4.32">when it comes to like working conditions</text><text start="1008.56" dur="3.839">for working people i think we&apos;re going</text><text start="1010.32" dur="4.639">to make dramatic progress on that</text><text start="1012.399" dur="4.321">because again when we change the way</text><text start="1014.959" dur="3.921">that most of the lovers in our society</text><text start="1016.72" dur="3.84">work from being just political lovers or</text><text start="1018.88" dur="4.24">profit lovers when it comes to</text><text start="1020.56" dur="3.999">individual choice then literally any</text><text start="1023.12" dur="3.04">problem you see</text><text start="1024.559" dur="2.801">you&apos;re going to be able to make progress</text><text start="1026.16" dur="3.36">on and that&apos;s not the way the world</text><text start="1027.36" dur="4.719">feels today like it does not feel like</text><text start="1029.52" dur="4.08">you can make a take an action that</text><text start="1032.079" dur="2.801">changes the world in the direction you</text><text start="1033.6" dur="3.76">want to see it that&apos;s not the world we</text><text start="1034.88" dur="4.799">live in but when this plays out when</text><text start="1037.36" dur="5.04">this decentralized society this broader</text><text start="1039.679" dur="4.16">crypto movement when it gets to that end</text><text start="1042.4" dur="3.36">state i think that&apos;s what it&apos;s going to</text><text start="1043.839" dur="3.921">look like you see a problem you are</text><text start="1045.76" dur="4.08">going to be able to take a step to fix</text><text start="1047.76" dur="5.039">it and maybe that step will feel too</text><text start="1049.84" dur="4.959">costly to you so you&apos;re saying okay well</text><text start="1052.799" dur="3.841">i&apos;m not willing to do what it takes to</text><text start="1054.799" dur="3.921">get that outcome i want it&apos;s not because</text><text start="1056.64" dur="3.84">you lost an election it&apos;s not because</text><text start="1058.72" dur="3.199">what you did isn&apos;t the most profitable</text><text start="1060.48" dur="3.52">it&apos;s literally because you as an</text><text start="1061.919" dur="4.321">individual are like ah i would rather</text><text start="1064.0" dur="4.08">spend my limited resources solving</text><text start="1066.24" dur="4.48">another problem instead so again there&apos;s</text><text start="1068.08" dur="4.24">still constraints it&apos;s not a utopia that</text><text start="1070.72" dur="4.079">we&apos;re going to live in but literally</text><text start="1072.32" dur="4.64">anything you care about you are the one</text><text start="1074.799" dur="3.921">who decides what outcome we end up</text><text start="1076.96" dur="4.32">getting</text><text start="1078.72" dur="5.52">that&apos;s beautiful um</text><text start="1081.28" dur="4.399">you know it i&apos;m hearing you kind of like</text><text start="1084.24" dur="2.72">talk to me about this collective action</text><text start="1085.679" dur="2.801">thing and i&apos;m just realizing that the</text><text start="1086.96" dur="3.68">way i talk about coordination and</text><text start="1088.48" dur="3.92">coordination failures kind of jibes with</text><text start="1090.64" dur="4.08">the way you talk about collective action</text><text start="1092.4" dur="4.48">and it&apos;s just beautiful to hear uh hear</text><text start="1094.72" dur="4.0">that come back well i guess like the</text><text start="1096.88" dur="4.24">question i i i have for you is like does</text><text start="1098.72" dur="4.319">that does does all of this scale like</text><text start="1101.12" dur="3.36">you know if if we&apos;re a team of five and</text><text start="1103.039" dur="3.801">we&apos;re trying to organize some action</text><text start="1104.48" dur="4.8">within theopolis or get coin community</text><text start="1106.84" dur="4.199">um that feels like a more surmountable</text><text start="1109.28" dur="3.92">problem than what you said about climate</text><text start="1111.039" dur="4.0">change you know does does what we&apos;re</text><text start="1113.2" dur="3.92">building in the web 3 space scale to</text><text start="1115.039" dur="3.52">solving our biggest global coordination</text><text start="1117.12" dur="4.96">failures and</text><text start="1118.559" dur="5.681">and how do we get there it if not uh</text><text start="1122.08" dur="3.599">absolutely it does i think</text><text start="1124.24" dur="3.2">literally the projects that everybody is</text><text start="1125.679" dur="2.961">working on today are part of the story</text><text start="1127.44" dur="3.599">about how we&apos;re going to change the</text><text start="1128.64" dur="3.919">world i i believe that and literally i</text><text start="1131.039" dur="3.281">want everyone who&apos;s watching us to</text><text start="1132.559" dur="3.521">believe that too because if you don&apos;t</text><text start="1134.32" dur="4.08">believe it you&apos;re not going to do it</text><text start="1136.08" dur="4.08">like you can only do things you believe</text><text start="1138.4" dur="3.36">so you need to believe that you have the</text><text start="1140.16" dur="3.2">power to change the world and when i</text><text start="1141.76" dur="2.48">show you how you&apos;re going to do it like</text><text start="1143.36" dur="3.04">you just</text><text start="1144.24" dur="4.319">go do it like i believe you actually</text><text start="1146.4" dur="2.96">have that power i believe everybody has</text><text start="1148.559" dur="3.281">so</text><text start="1149.36" dur="4.24">to me like individual communities</text><text start="1151.84" dur="4.719">solving their own problems is very</text><text start="1153.6" dur="4.959">important and the main collective action</text><text start="1156.559" dur="3.841">that i&apos;m talking about is important</text><text start="1158.559" dur="3.681">because i think it uh</text><text start="1160.4" dur="3.84">the the the vision that i want you to</text><text start="1162.24" dur="3.92">see in your head is something that looks</text><text start="1164.24" dur="4.24">like the labor movement something that&apos;s</text><text start="1166.16" dur="3.68">a whole bunch of people taking actions</text><text start="1168.48" dur="2.88">to get an outcome</text><text start="1169.84" dur="3.44">now the collective action that i&apos;m</text><text start="1171.36" dur="3.92">describing is not about organizing</text><text start="1173.28" dur="3.279">against employers like that&apos;s not really</text><text start="1175.28" dur="4.72">what it&apos;s about</text><text start="1176.559" dur="5.841">but i think we are engaged in a broad</text><text start="1180.0" dur="5.12">collective action against middlemen in</text><text start="1182.4" dur="4.32">our society the people who are basically</text><text start="1185.12" dur="3.6">collecting money</text><text start="1186.72" dur="3.76">that really belongs to us</text><text start="1188.72" dur="4.72">uh anytime you&apos;re interacting with a</text><text start="1190.48" dur="4.8">company that sells you as a product to</text><text start="1193.44" dur="4.08">somebody else there is a middleman</text><text start="1195.28" dur="4.639">extracting value that belongs to you so</text><text start="1197.52" dur="4.0">that that means facebook and google</text><text start="1199.919" dur="3.681">which get a ton of their money by</text><text start="1201.52" dur="4.0">selling your attention to businesses</text><text start="1203.6" dur="3.28">that want more customers in the door</text><text start="1205.52" dur="3.6">they&apos;re they&apos;re making money that</text><text start="1206.88" dur="3.279">belongs to you and i think you can get</text><text start="1209.12" dur="3.2">that back</text><text start="1210.159" dur="4.081">uh anytime you make a purchase at a</text><text start="1212.32" dur="4.4">store and you pay with the credit card</text><text start="1214.24" dur="4.64">uh that fee of like one percent plus</text><text start="1216.72" dur="4.48">some cents every single time that&apos;s a</text><text start="1218.88" dur="4.48">middleman collecting value it belongs to</text><text start="1221.2" dur="3.76">you and i think you can get it and again</text><text start="1223.36" dur="4.559">what this collective action is is</text><text start="1224.96" dur="4.88">literally collecting stamps everywhere</text><text start="1227.919" dur="4.081">in our economy i believe that by</text><text start="1229.84" dur="4.48">collecting stamps you can change the way</text><text start="1232.0" dur="4.159">that value flows in our economy to go in</text><text start="1234.32" dur="3.2">any direction you want some people are</text><text start="1236.159" dur="3.441">going to choose to take the value that</text><text start="1237.52" dur="3.6">belongs to them and put it in get coins</text><text start="1239.6" dur="4.0">matching pools because they believe that</text><text start="1241.12" dur="4.64">quadratic funding plural funding is a</text><text start="1243.6" dur="3.76">more democratic way to shape public</text><text start="1245.76" dur="3.36">goods a lot of people are going to do</text><text start="1247.36" dur="3.76">that some people are going to take those</text><text start="1249.12" dur="3.76">resources to fund decentralized identity</text><text start="1251.12" dur="4.64">systems that they think give them more</text><text start="1252.88" dur="4.56">control in our economy over what uh</text><text start="1255.76" dur="3.279">what&apos;s actually done with their data a</text><text start="1257.44" dur="3.119">lot of people are going to do that like</text><text start="1259.039" dur="3.441">there&apos;s so many different people that</text><text start="1260.559" dur="4.24">want different things but the thing that</text><text start="1262.48" dur="4.64">we&apos;re all gonna do together is collect</text><text start="1264.799" dur="3.36">stamps because every time you collect a</text><text start="1267.12" dur="2.48">stamp</text><text start="1268.159" dur="2.4">dollars that we&apos;re gonna go to a</text><text start="1269.6" dur="3.04">middleman</text><text start="1270.559" dur="3.841">goes to your community instead</text><text start="1272.64" dur="3.919">so think about the campaigns that i was</text><text start="1274.4" dur="4.0">talking about the index co-op stamp</text><text start="1276.559" dur="4.0">where you get three dollars for</text><text start="1278.4" dur="3.84">subscribing to their newsletter or</text><text start="1280.559" dur="2.801">subscribing to their youtube channel</text><text start="1282.24" dur="3.52">they could have taken those three</text><text start="1283.36" dur="4.559">dollars and spent it on a facebook ad</text><text start="1285.76" dur="4.56">and getting gotten the same result</text><text start="1287.919" dur="4.801">what we&apos;re asking businesses to do is</text><text start="1290.32" dur="4.719">not charity we&apos;re asking them to take</text><text start="1292.72" dur="4.24">their marketing budget and move where it</text><text start="1295.039" dur="4.401">goes instead of spending their marketing</text><text start="1296.96" dur="4.88">budget and making mark zuckerberg richer</text><text start="1299.44" dur="4.16">so he can buy more and more of hawaii we</text><text start="1301.84" dur="4.0">want them to take that marketing budget</text><text start="1303.6" dur="3.84">and literally put it in the communities</text><text start="1305.84" dur="2.4">that every single one of their customers</text><text start="1307.44" dur="3.44">are in</text><text start="1308.24" dur="4.72">like that is literally how we change the</text><text start="1310.88" dur="4.24">world together the more of these stamps</text><text start="1312.96" dur="4.16">you collect the more the value shifts</text><text start="1315.12" dur="3.439">away from middlemen and into your</text><text start="1317.12" dur="4.64">communities and to communities like</text><text start="1318.559" dur="5.841">bitcoin colonel bankless and outside of</text><text start="1321.76" dur="4.72">crypto to those clubs nonprofits</text><text start="1324.4" dur="3.04">churches schools whatever it is you want</text><text start="1326.48" dur="3.84">to support</text><text start="1327.44" dur="5.2">there&apos;s this giant endowment with a huge</text><text start="1330.32" dur="4.64">balance and that is all the advertising</text><text start="1332.64" dur="4.64">spending in our economy today and again</text><text start="1334.96" dur="4.16">you need to believe that you can access</text><text start="1337.28" dur="3.84">that that you can actually take that</text><text start="1339.12" dur="3.6">value and take it to any community you</text><text start="1341.12" dur="3.28">want because again if you don&apos;t believe</text><text start="1342.72" dur="3.28">it you&apos;re not going to go do it but</text><text start="1344.4" dur="3.68">literally the way you do it is by</text><text start="1346.0" dur="4.4">collecting stamps the more stamps you</text><text start="1348.08" dur="4.88">collect the more of that value you shift</text><text start="1350.4" dur="5.12">and that&apos;s how you access the shared uh</text><text start="1352.96" dur="4.8">endowment that&apos;s there the value already</text><text start="1355.52" dur="3.6">exists those dollars are flowing you and</text><text start="1357.76" dur="2.72">i are going to change the way those</text><text start="1359.12" dur="3.36">dollars flow and they&apos;re going to go</text><text start="1360.48" dur="3.6">into everybody&apos;s communities</text><text start="1362.48" dur="4.8">yeah i think this really gets to the</text><text start="1364.08" dur="5.599">heart of how we coordinate in the web 3</text><text start="1367.28" dur="3.44">era i mean you know i just love that you</text><text start="1369.679" dur="2.801">pointed out that you can get the same</text><text start="1370.72" dur="3.76">results with a facebook ad as you could</text><text start="1372.48" dur="3.6">with with one of these stamps but you&apos;re</text><text start="1374.48" dur="4.319">kind of cutting out the intermediary</text><text start="1376.08" dur="4.719">there and and i think that collective</text><text start="1378.799" dur="3.921">action but without these like</text><text start="1380.799" dur="4.0">value extractive intermediaries gets</text><text start="1382.72" dur="3.6">really interesting not only because then</text><text start="1384.799" dur="3.521">there&apos;s more money for the causes that</text><text start="1386.32" dur="4.719">we care about but also you get this</text><text start="1388.32" dur="4.479">higher resolution view of what the</text><text start="1391.039" dur="3.921">community cares about when it&apos;s</text><text start="1392.799" dur="3.76">peer-to-peer as opposed to peer through</text><text start="1394.96" dur="4.16">an intermediary that distorts and</text><text start="1396.559" dur="4.081">extracts to peer um</text><text start="1399.12" dur="2.96">and so</text><text start="1400.64" dur="3.519">you know i&apos;m just envisioning this world</text><text start="1402.08" dur="4.0">in which we have collective action but</text><text start="1404.159" dur="3.601">there&apos;s no rent seekers in the middle</text><text start="1406.08" dur="3.839">and it&apos;s made explicit on chain we&apos;ve</text><text start="1407.76" dur="4.72">got a shared source of truth around the</text><text start="1409.919" dur="4.88">actions that have momentum and just by</text><text start="1412.48" dur="5.439">making it more explicit it kind of</text><text start="1414.799" dur="5.12">enables more networked collective action</text><text start="1417.919" dur="3.76">uh for each individual agent in the</text><text start="1419.919" dur="3.281">system and i think that that&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="1421.679" dur="3.921">really cool about a world in which these</text><text start="1423.2" dur="4.4">stamps have if there&apos;s a lot of stamps</text><text start="1425.6" dur="3.76">out there then i think that that enables</text><text start="1427.6" dur="4.0">a lot more reputation</text><text start="1429.36" dur="4.4">enables a lot more uh sort of like</text><text start="1431.6" dur="3.28">understanding of each other i mean can</text><text start="1433.76" dur="3.519">you can you tell me about this world in</text><text start="1434.88" dur="4.399">which pan bala and pinball stamps is is</text><text start="1437.279" dur="3.361">maximally successful i guess that&apos;s the</text><text start="1439.279" dur="3.361">question that i&apos;m that i&apos;m aiming</text><text start="1440.64" dur="3.84">towards like say in five or ten years</text><text start="1442.64" dur="3.44">y&apos;all are maximally successful what does</text><text start="1444.48" dur="3.92">that world look like</text><text start="1446.08" dur="3.839">sure before i do that i want to tell you</text><text start="1448.4" dur="3.84">this year and then i&apos;ll tell you that</text><text start="1449.919" dur="5.76">one so cool</text><text start="1452.24" dur="5.039">the the early days of uh this this</text><text start="1455.679" dur="3.36">movement this mass movement that we&apos;re</text><text start="1457.279" dur="4.4">organizing to shift where value flows in</text><text start="1459.039" dur="4.401">our economy the early days look like</text><text start="1461.679" dur="4.561">more and more communities building up a</text><text start="1463.44" dur="4.08">culture of stamp collecting it has to be</text><text start="1466.24" dur="3.2">normal</text><text start="1467.52" dur="3.68">in your community to collect these</text><text start="1469.44" dur="4.239">stamps to drive more resources to your</text><text start="1471.2" dur="4.16">community so again that means that</text><text start="1473.679" dur="3.281">community leaders like people who are</text><text start="1475.36" dur="2.799">actively involved in the community</text><text start="1476.96" dur="2.959">actually saying hey here are these</text><text start="1478.159" dur="3.921">stamps you can collect to fund the</text><text start="1479.919" dur="4.321">events that we throw the grants that we</text><text start="1482.08" dur="3.599">give whatever it is your community does</text><text start="1484.24" dur="3.919">like somebody has to actually be</text><text start="1485.679" dur="4.641">mobilizing people to build this culture</text><text start="1488.159" dur="4.321">from scratch it&apos;s not normal to collect</text><text start="1490.32" dur="4.32">stamps to fund your community today and</text><text start="1492.48" dur="3.199">the early phase looks like making it</text><text start="1494.64" dur="2.96">normal</text><text start="1495.679" dur="4.0">establishing a new culture where it&apos;s</text><text start="1497.6" dur="4.319">what just what people expect to do they</text><text start="1499.679" dur="4.0">expect to go get stamps and redeem them</text><text start="1501.919" dur="4.081">to fund their community that&apos;s what the</text><text start="1503.679" dur="3.761">early days look like so again most of</text><text start="1506.0" dur="3.12">those early stamps are going to be</text><text start="1507.44" dur="3.44">sponsored by businesses that serve</text><text start="1509.12" dur="3.76">crypto people because crypto people are</text><text start="1510.88" dur="3.84">who are here today so it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="1512.88" dur="3.52">people like index co-op annopolis it&apos;s</text><text start="1514.72" dur="3.52">going to be people like crypto exchanges</text><text start="1516.4" dur="3.92">it&apos;s going to be people like uh people</text><text start="1518.24" dur="4.96">uh trying to get developers to use their</text><text start="1520.32" dur="4.88">tools that kind of business is what the</text><text start="1523.2" dur="4.479">early sponsors look like and again the</text><text start="1525.2" dur="4.4">early communities are crypto communities</text><text start="1527.679" dur="3.841">but again we want to grow the movement</text><text start="1529.6" dur="4.0">we want to expand the set of communities</text><text start="1531.52" dur="4.24">in the network to be more normal people</text><text start="1533.6" dur="4.16">communities clubs nonprofits dance</text><text start="1535.76" dur="3.84">classes whatever it is we want to plug</text><text start="1537.76" dur="4.08">more communities into the network and</text><text start="1539.6" dur="4.079">then expand the base of sponsors to</text><text start="1541.84" dur="3.92">where it&apos;s more like literally every</text><text start="1543.679" dur="4.321">business in the economy we want to be</text><text start="1545.76" dur="4.32">minting these stamps to fund communities</text><text start="1548.0" dur="4.48">that their customers are in</text><text start="1550.08" dur="3.76">so if we fast forward a couple years</text><text start="1552.48" dur="4.24">after we&apos;ve gotten</text><text start="1553.84" dur="5.52">uh scam to be ubiquitous in the crypto</text><text start="1556.72" dur="5.6">world uh and then spreading out locally</text><text start="1559.36" dur="5.04">to become ubiquitous in our own cities</text><text start="1562.32" dur="4.4">what happens then is that we have a new</text><text start="1564.4" dur="4.48">kind of power that we didn&apos;t before</text><text start="1566.72" dur="4.16">because again like what we&apos;re doing is</text><text start="1568.88" dur="5.76">starting by shifting value from</text><text start="1570.88" dur="5.52">advertising budgets to communities</text><text start="1574.64" dur="3.68">but once you have that</text><text start="1576.4" dur="4.56">stamps are actually fundamentally</text><text start="1578.32" dur="4.56">different from how ads work when you</text><text start="1580.96" dur="4.56">spend money on ads there&apos;s a point where</text><text start="1582.88" dur="3.919">you hit diminishing returns where you&apos;ve</text><text start="1585.52" dur="3.279">reached all the people you&apos;re going to</text><text start="1586.799" dur="4.0">reach and spending more money on ads</text><text start="1588.799" dur="3.681">doesn&apos;t make any sense</text><text start="1590.799" dur="3.12">stamps don&apos;t actually have that</text><text start="1592.48" dur="4.0">attribute they&apos;re fundamentally</text><text start="1593.919" dur="3.521">different when you make a purchasing</text><text start="1596.48" dur="3.52">decision</text><text start="1597.44" dur="4.0">in the world that we&apos;re going to live in</text><text start="1600.0" dur="3.36">you&apos;re going to be making that decision</text><text start="1601.44" dur="3.92">based on how much in stamps you&apos;re going</text><text start="1603.36" dur="3.919">to get back from the business you do</text><text start="1605.36" dur="3.919">business with so you think of it as a</text><text start="1607.279" dur="3.28">percentage the same way with a credit</text><text start="1609.279" dur="3.28">card you might get a certain rate of</text><text start="1610.559" dur="3.521">rewards literally everywhere in our</text><text start="1612.559" dur="4.0">economy you&apos;re getting a certain rate of</text><text start="1614.08" dur="4.0">stamps that fund your community</text><text start="1616.559" dur="3.12">so the reason there&apos;s no diminishing</text><text start="1618.08" dur="4.079">returns on that is because it&apos;s a</text><text start="1619.679" dur="4.801">competition every business wants to give</text><text start="1622.159" dur="4.961">as much as possible to be able to earn</text><text start="1624.48" dur="4.48">your business so literally anywhere they</text><text

dur="4.801">amazing yeah i feel the exact same way</text><text start="2211.68" dur="3.76">oh in a similar way with git coin and</text><text start="2214.16" dur="3.12">one of the things that i&apos;m so thankful</text><text start="2215.44" dur="3.76">about in this space is that we can all</text><text start="2217.28" dur="3.52">be building it together um i feel like</text><text start="2219.2" dur="3.44">we&apos;re running web 2 companies we&apos;d all</text><text start="2220.8" dur="3.68">be sort of elbowing each other out for</text><text start="2222.64" dur="3.36">market share but there&apos;s this sort of</text><text start="2224.48" dur="3.52">beautiful social</text><text start="2226.0" dur="4.0">and then technological interop that&apos;s</text><text start="2228.0" dur="4.4">enabled by the ethos of web 3 but also</text><text start="2230.0" dur="3.839">the modularity of web 3 where you know</text><text start="2232.4" dur="3.04">git coins one of the things we&apos;re</text><text start="2233.839" dur="3.28">focused on right now is grants 2.0 and</text><text start="2235.44" dur="3.679">civil resistance in a decentralized way</text><text start="2237.119" dur="4.24">we could accept the pan bala passports</text><text start="2239.119" dur="3.601">into that into our reputation system and</text><text start="2241.359" dur="3.361">pinball can</text><text

community through the</text><text start="2249.04" dur="5.039">aperture of bitcoin grants choosing to</text><text start="2251.2" dur="6.24">fund you um and just like that that</text><text start="2254.079" dur="5.28">social and the technological interop and</text><text start="2257.44" dur="4.56">um and then like maybe governance</text><text start="2259.359" dur="4.24">interop at some point like deeply tying</text><text start="2262.0" dur="4.0">things together creates this whole mesh</text><text start="2263.599" dur="4.401">network that we rise and fall together</text><text start="2266.0" dur="4.16">uh and i think that&apos;s a beautiful</text><text start="2268.0" dur="4.4">thing for a regenerative community if we</text><text start="2270.16" dur="3.76">have these impact owls that are each by</text><text start="2272.4" dur="2.8">definition because their impact ls have</text><text start="2273.92" dur="2.88">positive externalities and they&apos;re</text><text start="2275.2" dur="3.2">clustering around each other we&apos;re going</text><text start="2276.8" dur="4.08">to create this like rich fauna of an</text><text start="2278.4" dur="4.48">ecosystem that&apos;s on top of each other</text><text start="2280.88" dur="3.44">building modular parts of how we can</text><text start="2282.88" dur="3.92">regenerate the world and i see this like</text><text start="2284.32" dur="4.16">emergent bottom-up phenomenon that comes</text><text start="2286.8" dur="3.76">out of that i mean is there anything to</text><text start="2288.48" dur="3.359">say about i i think that you you&apos;re like</text><text start="2290.56" dur="2.4">the perfect person to ask this question</text><text start="2291.839" dur="2.641">because you&apos;ve got i think you said</text><text start="2292.96" dur="3.36">80-something communities in penn vault</text><text start="2294.48" dur="3.76">like how do you see</text><text start="2296.32" dur="4.0">dals forming into multicellular</text><text start="2298.24" dur="4.56">organisms like what&apos;s the future of dow</text><text start="2300.32" dur="4.24">to dao look like is it token swaps is it</text><text start="2302.8" dur="3.76">social interop is it technological</text><text start="2304.56" dur="3.279">interop is it all of it like what have</text><text start="2306.56" dur="2.72">you observed because i think that you&apos;ve</text><text start="2307.839" dur="2.801">got the alpha here you&apos;ve been doing</text><text start="2309.28" dur="3.04">this for four years and you&apos;ve got 80</text><text start="2310.64" dur="3.199">communities that pinball what have you</text><text start="2312.32" dur="2.72">seen and and how do you think that will</text><text start="2313.839" dur="4.161">evolve</text><text start="2315.04" dur="5.28">yeah so in a very real sense i&apos;m kind of</text><text start="2318.0" dur="3.76">a traditionalist especially when it</text><text start="2320.32" dur="3.12">comes to what crypto and</text><text start="2321.76" dur="2.56">decentralization people typically</text><text start="2323.44" dur="3.44">believe</text><text start="2324.32" dur="6.08">like the default stance with new</text><text start="2326.88" dur="5.44">web3 dow crypto stuff is to</text><text start="2330.4" dur="3.36">try to find the new way the new way</text><text start="2332.32" dur="3.039">we&apos;re going to do things that emerges</text><text start="2333.76" dur="3.2">from the tools that we have</text><text start="2335.359" dur="3.441">and i actually believe most of what</text><text start="2336.96" dur="4.0">we&apos;re going to do is going to be a</text><text start="2338.8" dur="4.24">repeat of these uh something that</text><text start="2340.96" dur="4.399">already exists so i always try to find</text><text start="2343.04" dur="4.48">the old theme the older the better uh</text><text start="2345.359" dur="4.081">the old pattern that looks like what i</text><text start="2347.52" dur="3.12">think things can play out</text><text start="2349.44" dur="4.399">so</text><text start="2350.64" dur="4.719">instead of uh like uh token swaps i i&apos;m</text><text start="2353.839" dur="5.52">glad people are trying them because they</text><text start="2355.359" dur="5.76">might be effective uh but i think what&apos;s</text><text start="2359.359" dur="4.641">like i i think the</text><text start="2361.119" dur="4.72">order that seems the most uh that comes</text><text start="2364.0" dur="3.52">up the most in history and that seems</text><text start="2365.839" dur="4.401">the most stable to me</text><text start="2367.52" dur="4.0">is finding ways to federate and uh</text><text start="2370.24" dur="3.599">basically have</text><text start="2371.52" dur="4.4">organizations where there&apos;s maximal</text><text start="2373.839" dur="4.641">independence within each community but</text><text start="2375.92" dur="4.64">they come together to</text><text start="2378.48" dur="5.119">act in their collective interests and</text><text start="2380.56" dur="4.24">the model the the metaphor that i use</text><text start="2383.599" dur="3.441">the most of my thinking is actually</text><text start="2384.8" dur="4.64">sports leagues like sports leagues do</text><text start="2387.04" dur="4.319">this a ton like they have independent</text><text start="2389.44" dur="3.52">teams that are independently controlled</text><text start="2391.359" dur="4.161">and have ways to organize for their</text><text start="2392.96" dur="5.2">collective benefit and they do that to</text><text start="2395.52" dur="4.4">great uh success in a lot of times uh</text><text start="2398.16" dur="3.36">the most interesting story in that</text><text start="2399.92" dur="3.919">regard recently has been major league</text><text start="2401.52" dur="4.96">soccer and seeing them like through</text><text start="2403.839" dur="4.961">sheer force of will makes soccer popular</text><text start="2406.48" dur="4.96">in america which is a</text><text start="2408.8" dur="5.36">a very hard task to accomplish but like</text><text start="2411.44" dur="5.28">they did it because they had this asset</text><text start="2414.16" dur="4.24">that they all built a network around</text><text start="2416.72" dur="3.68">and then they had ways to organize for</text><text start="2418.4" dur="5.36">the collective good of the sport</text><text start="2420.4" dur="5.679">and i think that same sort of thing</text><text start="2423.76" dur="4.24">is what will emerge through crypto and</text><text start="2426.079" dur="3.361">again i don&apos;t think we&apos;re there yet i</text><text start="2428.0" dur="3.28">think actually most of the assets that</text><text start="2429.44" dur="4.48">we have in crypto will end up being a</text><text start="2431.28" dur="4.96">barrier to competition a barrier to</text><text start="2433.92" dur="4.0">cooperation rather than ease it over</text><text start="2436.24" dur="4.32">time but i think if we have the</text><text start="2437.92" dur="4.96">cooperative ethos where we assume again</text><text start="2440.56" dur="4.16">just believing that we can end up in a</text><text start="2442.88" dur="3.52">cooperative situation is what&apos;s going to</text><text start="2444.72" dur="4.0">allow us to be there belief is a very</text><text start="2446.4" dur="3.6">important thing and if we believe that</text><text start="2448.72" dur="2.96">we&apos;re going to find ways to make all</text><text start="2450.0" dur="3.599">these things cooperate then i think</text><text start="2451.68" dur="3.679">we&apos;re more likely to do it i do think</text><text start="2453.599" dur="4.48">we&apos;re going to have to adjust what</text><text start="2455.359" dur="4.72">tokens and different assets and crypto</text><text start="2458.079" dur="4.24">mean to get there because again by</text><text start="2460.079" dur="3.601">default they&apos;re much more similar to</text><text start="2462.319" dur="3.441">corporations they&apos;re comp they&apos;re</text><text start="2463.68" dur="3.12">competitive by default but if we find</text><text start="2465.76" dur="4.079">ways to</text><text start="2466.8" dur="5.12">uh get past that i think there&apos;s a</text><text start="2469.839" dur="4.401">bright future of cooperation between all</text><text start="2471.92" dur="4.159">these different things out there</text><text start="2474.24" dur="4.879">nice yeah it&apos;s just a beautiful world</text><text start="2476.079" dur="5.921">when i think about intra-dao cooperation</text><text start="2479.119" dur="5.841">and then inter dao cooperation and then</text><text start="2482.0" dur="4.319">we start to think about ecosystems and</text><text start="2484.96" dur="3.44">um</text><text start="2486.319" dur="3.52">yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s it it&apos;s really beautiful</text><text start="2488.4" dur="2.56">when i when i sort of think up and down</text><text start="2489.839" dur="2.721">that stack</text><text start="2490.96" dur="2.96">um is there i think we&apos;re kind of</text><text start="2492.56" dur="2.96">running short on time is there anything</text><text start="2493.92" dur="3.12">that i didn&apos;t ask that you want to talk</text><text start="2495.52" dur="3.599">about</text><text start="2497.04" dur="4.559">i think we got to almost all the things</text><text start="2499.119" dur="4.321">the one thing that i want to be able to</text><text start="2501.599" dur="3.841">talk through with you especially is just</text><text start="2503.44" dur="4.72">visualizing since this movement that</text><text start="2505.44" dur="4.48">we&apos;re trying to organize uh involves so</text><text start="2508.16" dur="3.12">many different communities i think</text><text start="2509.92" dur="2.96">thinking through a thought experiment of</text><text start="2511.28" dur="3.6">how it would work with git coin in</text><text start="2512.88" dur="4.64">particular would be pretty valuable for</text><text start="2514.88" dur="4.8">everybody so like again people are</text><text start="2517.52" dur="5.76">already collecting stamps and choosing</text><text start="2519.68" dur="6.399">git coin to redeem them so if we imagine</text><text start="2523.28" dur="5.6">more broadly how stamps fit in with a</text><text start="2526.079" dur="4.641">git coin in general like the the the</text><text start="2528.88" dur="3.76">best example of how it can be used again</text><text start="2530.72" dur="3.68">this isn&apos;t how you have to do anything</text><text start="2532.64" dur="4.0">but an example of how it could</text><text start="2534.4" dur="4.24">interoperate is if people are collecting</text><text start="2536.64" dur="3.84">stamps and they&apos;re using those stamps to</text><text start="2538.64" dur="4.08">fund get coins matching pool</text><text start="2540.48" dur="4.16">the way to build a culture of stamp</text><text start="2542.72" dur="3.84">collecting within the git coin community</text><text start="2544.64" dur="4.08">i think is to tie that into the way git</text><text start="2546.56" dur="3.92">coin works so there&apos;s already a</text><text start="2548.72" dur="4.399">mechanism within git coin the trust</text><text start="2550.48" dur="4.8">bonus of whenever you tie into a new</text><text start="2553.119" dur="3.841">identity system uh leveraging the fact</text><text start="2555.28" dur="5.2">that identity is core to the way that</text><text start="2556.96" dur="5.84">plural funding works you get more of uh</text><text start="2560.48" dur="4.16">matching when we&apos;ve been able to verify</text><text start="2562.8" dur="4.08">that your identity is strong</text><text start="2564.64" dur="4.16">so if we also say you can get a higher</text><text start="2566.88" dur="3.6">trust bonus if you&apos;re actively</text><text start="2568.8" dur="3.92">collecting stamps you&apos;re actively</text><text start="2570.48" dur="4.56">driving more value away from middlemen</text><text start="2572.72" dur="5.84">and then to get coins matching pool like</text><text start="2575.04" dur="5.36">i think that&apos;s one vision of how uh this</text><text start="2578.56" dur="4.96">culture of stamp collecting starts to</text><text start="2580.4" dur="4.56">grow and because git coins community</text><text start="2583.52" dur="3.36">is one of the most active ones in</text><text start="2584.96" dur="3.52">actually taking action that exists in</text><text start="2586.88" dur="2.88">crypto like there&apos;s a lot of communities</text><text start="2588.48" dur="3.04">out there but the get going community is</text><text start="2589.76" dur="3.92">the only one out there every quarter</text><text start="2591.52" dur="3.44">making transactions on chain to support</text><text start="2593.68" dur="4.399">what&apos;s going on</text><text start="2594.96" dur="5.6">so like the more that this movement</text><text start="2598.079" dur="5.76">takes hold within the git coin community</text><text start="2600.56" dur="5.2">the more i think uh it it will succeed</text><text start="2603.839" dur="4.641">in general like the coin community is</text><text start="2605.76" dur="3.92">very key to the the world that i see in</text><text start="2608.48" dur="3.2">my head</text><text start="2609.68" dur="3.52">amazing yeah i mean i think it&apos;s really</text><text start="2611.68" dur="3.04">beautiful that we&apos;ve been building this</text><text start="2613.2" dur="3.6">this world together for several years</text><text start="2614.72" dur="4.56">and looking forward to seeing pinball</text><text start="2616.8" dur="4.24">succeed a lot and um</text><text start="2619.28" dur="4.72">you know as get coin becomes a dow and</text><text start="2621.04" dur="5.039">becomes its own beast i think that uh i</text><text start="2624.0" dur="4.64">hope to see</text><text start="2626.079" dur="3.921">much continued interrupt between pinball</text><text start="2628.64" dur="2.88">and git coin it&apos;s been really beautiful</text><text start="2630.0" dur="2.96">pinball git coin and i know colonel</text><text start="2631.52" dur="3.839">colonel is actually now independent from</text><text start="2632.96" dur="3.52">bitcoin but uh you know just i think</text><text start="2635.359" dur="3.601">that that&apos;s</text><text start="2636.48" dur="4.639">uh a beautiful example of dow to dial</text><text start="2638.96" dur="3.92">coordination and if we can kind of keep</text><text start="2641.119" dur="2.96">doing that dance and spread the word out</text><text start="2642.88" dur="2.8">to the rest of the ecosystem it&apos;s going</text><text start="2644.079" dur="4.721">to be a beautiful thing</text><text start="2645.68" dur="5.639">uh so thank you for your work thus far</text><text start="2648.8" dur="4.799">i&apos;m excited about pen vowel stamps uh</text><text start="2651.319" dur="3.881">penvala.coms is the call to action and</text><text start="2653.599" dur="2.641">where can people find you in penvala</text><text start="2655.2" dur="3.44">online</text><text start="2656.24" dur="5.359">uh so on twitter i&apos;m at neuron that&apos;s</text><text start="2658.64" dur="5.64">n-i-r-a-n on twitter and then panvala is</text><text

thing</text><text start="2669.599" dur="2.561">that i want you to leave here with is</text><text start="2670.8" dur="3.76">with the belief that you can actually</text><text start="2672.16"

dur="4.161">it&apos;s how we make every community have a</text><text start="2687.28" dur="3.76">larger budget and how we stop having to</text><text start="2689.28" dur="3.28">have political fights we
