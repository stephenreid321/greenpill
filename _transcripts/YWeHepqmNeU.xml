start="34.32" dur="3.419">reefs or the biodiversity of your local</text><text start="36.0" dur="4.32">economy and then that creates an</text><text start="37.739" dur="4.741">incentive for people to

don&apos;t</text><text start="244.26" dur="3.72">need to have to sit down to to just one</text><text start="246.239" dur="2.821">sentence do you have any Pilots live</text><text start="247.98" dur="4.08">right now</text><text start="249.06" dur="4.86">yeah for sure so we have a pilot right</text><text start="252.06" dur="3.66">now in Curacao it&apos;s a small Caribbean</text><text start="253.92" dur="3.659">island we actually started</text><text start="255.72" dur="3.12">experimentation there over four years</text><text start="257.579" dur="3.481">ago</text><text start="258.84" dur="4.38">um it started back in 2018 when we</text><text start="261.06" dur="3.419">received a grant from Dao stack which</text><text start="263.22" dur="3.24">was one of the let&apos;s call it the three</text><text start="264.479" dur="5.101">big guys back in those days</text><text start="266.46" dur="5.04">um you had Aragon Dallas tag and Colony</text><text start="269.58" dur="3.42">um this was kind of pre-moliked out pre</text><text start="271.5" dur="2.88">a lot of the things that people may</text><text start="273.0" dur="2.88">consider kind of the start of Dao</text><text start="274.38" dur="3.36">history now</text><text start="275.88" dur="3.36">um we received a grant to look for the</text><text start="277.74" dur="4.739">potential of decentralized governance</text><text start="279.24" dur="5.22">for small island nations specifically</text><text start="282.479" dur="4.201">um that research showed to our surprise</text><text start="284.46" dur="4.44">of course not that over 50 percent of</text><text start="286.68" dur="4.56">public good funding went away because of</text><text start="288.9" dur="4.32">nepotism it kind of trickled down to the</text><text start="291.24" dur="3.3">wrong Pockets</text><text start="293.22" dur="3.3">um and we looked at three different</text><text start="294.54" dur="4.86">areas we look at the social the social</text><text start="296.52" dur="5.82">effects the economic effects and the</text><text start="299.4" dur="5.88">um ecological effects of that kind of</text><text start="302.34" dur="4.74">um male governance that started a whole</text><text start="305.28" dur="4.38">crazy journey of now four years to</text><text start="307.08" dur="6.48">trying to build solutions for that</text><text start="309.66" dur="5.58">um back in 2019 we created curadou which</text><text start="313.56" dur="3.66">was I think one of the first if not the</text><text start="315.24" dur="4.38">first impact down in the world</text><text start="317.22" dur="4.08">um it was a group of about 50 people</text><text start="319.62" dur="4.019">um all locals from the island governing</text><text start="321.3" dur="5.16">a small treasury together and they were</text><text start="323.639" dur="5.4">allocating that to microgrants to</text><text start="326.46" dur="6.299">um yeah local ngos local individuals</text><text start="329.039" dur="5.761">from that experimentation we realized</text><text start="332.759" dur="4.741">that having a mechanism for Distributing</text><text start="334.8" dur="4.32">resources is incredible but we still</text><text start="337.5" dur="4.16">need to attract resources which was</text><text start="339.12" dur="5.16">still a problem</text><text start="341.66" dur="4.3">yeah I&apos;m sorry I didn&apos;t mean to I was</text><text start="344.28" dur="4.08">gonna say like I wanted to pause and</text><text start="345.96" dur="3.66">just camp on that point for a second a</text><text start="348.36" dur="4.5">lot of people think that the biggest</text><text start="349.62" dur="5.04">problem with supporting public goods is</text><text start="352.86" dur="3.839">uh raising the money but there&apos;s</text><text start="354.66" dur="3.599">actually a whole other side of that coin</text><text start="356.699" dur="3.06">when it comes to Distributing the funds</text><text start="358.259" dur="3.841">in a legitimate way and what you said</text><text start="359.759" dur="4.921">about 50 of the funds going to nepotism</text><text start="362.1" dur="4.14">or being misallocated is a huge problem</text><text start="364.68" dur="4.079">and I think that&apos;s actually one of the</text><text start="366.24" dur="3.899">big opportunities for the space is to</text><text start="368.759" dur="4.38">build networks of collective</text><text start="370.139" dur="5.4">intelligence to figure out how to uh uh</text><text start="373.139" dur="4.741">route resources in a more legitimate way</text><text start="375.539" dur="3.72">so um yeah thanks for letting me just</text><text start="377.88" dur="3.659">camp on that point please foresee yeah</text><text start="379.259" dur="3.841">100 and I think that I was listening to</text><text start="381.539" dur="3.78">the episode that you did about impact</text><text start="383.1" dur="4.68">networks and I think what you&apos;re</text><text start="385.319" dur="4.201">describing is collective intelligence a</text><text start="387.78" dur="4.44">lot of the times that nepotism is not</text><text start="389.52" dur="5.04">mountained they&apos;re not trying to screw</text><text start="392.22" dur="3.96">people over just by sheer lack of</text><text start="394.56" dur="5.04">information and lack of understanding</text><text start="396.18" dur="5.579">they end up screwing people over but</text><text start="399.6" dur="3.42">it&apos;s majority of the times they&apos;re not</text><text start="401.759" dur="2.94">trying to screw people over it&apos;s just</text><text start="403.02" dur="3.66">the the system is designed in a way that</text><text start="404.699" dur="3.961">they end up doing that and I think</text><text start="406.68" dur="4.079">that&apos;s really something incredible about</text><text start="408.66" dur="4.5">the new way of organizing a new way of</text><text start="410.759" dur="3.961">coordination where we&apos;re really getting</text><text start="413.16" dur="3.36">more information from the edges of the</text><text start="414.72" dur="3.18">network from inside of the network and</text><text start="416.52" dur="3.54">we&apos;re able to make better decisions</text><text start="417.9" dur="3.6">together which I think that alone is</text><text start="420.06" dur="3.78">already such a big problem and something</text><text start="421.5" dur="4.08">so exciting about the space that we&apos;re</text><text start="423.84" dur="4.44">in that we can even dream about finding</text><text start="425.58" dur="4.98">solutions for that yeah um</text><text start="428.28" dur="3.78">so the Danish experiment was I would say</text><text start="430.56" dur="4.74">extremely successful</text><text start="432.06" dur="5.52">um we got support from all areas of the</text><text start="435.3" dur="4.14">island but then we realized that without</text><text start="437.58" dur="3.54">resources we can&apos;t really do much with</text><text start="439.44" dur="4.08">our fancy tool</text><text start="441.12" dur="4.56">um so that opened our Research into</text><text start="443.52" dur="3.54">Community currencies which is an</text><text start="445.68" dur="2.94">innovation that already existed</text><text start="447.06" dur="3.38">pre-crypto</text><text start="448.62" dur="4.26">it&apos;s essentially these local</text><text start="450.44" dur="4.36">complementary currencies they could be</text><text start="452.88" dur="4.68">vouchers they could be a web 2 system an</text><text start="454.8" dur="4.619">SMS system whatever that already exists</text><text start="457.56" dur="4.38">in a couple hundred locations to</text><text start="459.419" dur="4.801">increase local production and trade</text><text start="461.94" dur="4.199">um so for example Brixton in Sardinia</text><text start="464.22" dur="4.02">you have these these networks of</text><text start="466.139" dur="4.861">hundreds of merchants that accept it and</text><text start="468.24" dur="4.859">they are forgiven legitimacy and</text><text start="471.0" dur="4.02">um kind of allow that area to thrive</text><text start="473.099" dur="3.781">without needing outside input or leading</text><text start="475.02" dur="3.84">less outside input</text><text start="476.88" dur="5.039">um this was around the time as well when</text><text start="478.86" dur="5.459">D5 started to emerge slowly</text><text start="481.919" dur="4.801">um I was always at the Forefront</text><text start="484.319" dur="4.5">building doubts I co-founded alfast with</text><text start="486.72" dur="4.319">Felipe Duarte which later became the</text><text start="488.819" dur="4.38">Taoist so I&apos;ve been really at the</text><text start="491.039" dur="4.44">Forefront of Dao innovation</text><text start="493.199" dur="4.44">and it&apos;s around early 2020 when it was</text><text start="495.479" dur="3.301">very clear that everybody only cared</text><text start="497.639" dur="3.96">about defy</text><text start="498.78" dur="4.259">um I think there was Defcon 2020</text><text start="501.599" dur="2.82">um we were trying to make a case for</text><text start="503.039" dur="3.241">Dallas but everything that people cared</text><text start="504.419" dur="3.481">about was sunny and Kane and kind of</text><text start="506.28" dur="3.359">what they were up to</text><text start="507.9" dur="3.96">um so this was kind of trivial on the</text><text start="509.639" dur="3.9">show that hey this financial stack is</text><text start="511.86" dur="3.179">going to come maybe even before the Dow</text><text start="513.539" dur="3.42">stack comes</text><text start="515.039" dur="3.901">um so we even tried shifting to D5 fast</text><text start="516.959" dur="2.94">luckily we never did that</text><text start="518.94" dur="3.18">um but</text><text start="519.899" dur="3.901">what it did do was unleash kind of our</text><text start="522.12" dur="3.48">tinkering around hey how can we leverage</text><text start="523.8" dur="3.12">defy to</text><text start="525.6" dur="2.94">um potentially solve this research</text><text start="526.92" dur="3.96">problem that we have</text><text start="528.54" dur="4.62">so then we applied for a grant from</text><text start="530.88" dur="4.8">maker Dao and we built together with</text><text start="533.16" dur="4.08">makerdale what we called curadai which</text><text start="535.68" dur="3.659">was a stable coin for the audience of</text><text start="537.24" dur="4.38">Curacao the not stable coin was quite</text><text start="539.339" dur="5.581">easy to make because Curacao just like</text><text start="541.62" dur="5.279">about 24 other countries has a currency</text><text start="544.92" dur="4.14">that&apos;s backed to the US dollar</text><text start="546.899" dur="3.841">which means that our Central Bank needs</text><text start="549.06" dur="4.02">to hold an x amount of US dollar in its</text><text start="550.74" dur="5.039">reserve and then because of that we can</text><text start="553.08" dur="4.68">hold a fixed exchange rate between our</text><text start="555.779" dur="4.441">currency and the dollar</text><text start="557.76" dur="4.139">um this used to be great in the times of</text><text start="560.22" dur="3.42">oil refinery because we used to be one</text><text start="561.899" dur="3.841">of the biggest all Refinery countries in</text><text start="563.64" dur="3.36">the world we&apos;re also number two most</text><text start="565.74" dur="3.18">polluting country in the world per</text><text start="567.0" dur="3.12">capita I think we should really be proud</text><text start="568.92" dur="2.7">of it</text><text start="570.12" dur="2.82">um not anymore though our Refinery is</text><text start="571.62" dur="2.64">closed now but</text><text start="572.94" dur="3.06">um essentially it was quite easy to make</text><text start="574.26" dur="2.639">the system because we have this fixed</text><text start="576.0" dur="2.7">pack</text><text start="576.899" dur="4.56">um but while doing that we also realized</text><text start="578.7" dur="4.62">the downsides of this fixed pack</text><text start="581.459" dur="4.261">um because and especially the past two</text><text start="583.32" dur="5.76">years every time that the US prints new</text><text start="585.72" dur="5.16">money our

start="626.339" dur="3.781">relying on food Aid</text><text start="628.32" dur="4.019">um so this really pushed us further and</text><text start="630.12" dur="4.08">further to go into this currency route</text><text start="632.339" dur="4.44">um we did this experiment with maker Dao</text><text start="634.2" dur="5.04">we proved that the models itself were</text><text start="636.779" dur="5.341">relatively easy to make let&apos;s say the</text><text start="639.24" dur="4.26">monitor monetary tools which was already</text><text start="642.12" dur="3.899">incredible right being able

that&apos;s great you&apos;ve</text><text start="653.22" dur="2.88">got like the legitimacy in the web 3</text><text start="654.839" dur="3.12">Community because you&apos;ve been deeply</text><text

dur="2.221">community</text><text start="660.899" dur="3.06">um I actually think that&apos;s a really</text><text start="661.74" dur="4.86">scalable model for taking web 3 tools</text><text

to be the bridge</text><text start="669.959" dur="4.981">between doing those things so how&apos;s</text><text start="672.66" dur="3.9">everything yeah 100 and I think we can</text><text start="674.94" dur="3.78">dive into that in a bit later kind of</text><text start="676.56" dur="3.42">how we aim to scale this but um it&apos;s</text><text start="678.72" dur="4.32">essentially this first fighter that</text><text start="679.98" dur="4.919">shows so much so make sure die was I</text><text start="683.04" dur="4.38">would say very successful what we saw is</text><text start="684.899" dur="5.221">that adding this cultural element to it</text><text start="687.42" dur="4.38">adding the colors and the feelings of of</text><text start="690.12" dur="3.36">a location</text><text

tremendously so we ran an</text><text start="698.459" dur="3.781">experiment I think for three to six</text><text start="699.899" dur="4.62">months we already had I think about 50</text><text

start="713.279" dur="4.5">their value and they adopt it quite</text><text start="715.68" dur="4.32">easily compared to previously we would</text><text start="717.779" dur="3.541">be issuing grants and

dur="4.44">guilders and then moment that they went</text><text start="725.64" dur="2.939">and claimed the grand it was only 800</text><text start="727.32" dur="2.94">killers and they would get mad at us</text><text start="728.579" dur="3.361">like hey are you scamming me</text><text start="730.26" dur="4.319">um you promised me a thousand I get 800</text><text start="731.94" dur="4.2">what&apos;s going on yeah um</text><text start="734.579" dur="4.081">and this was a pivoting moment actually</text><text start="736.14" dur="4.5">it&apos;s 2020 because as things got worse</text><text start="738.66" dur="4.08">and worse and worse we felt this urge to</text><text start="740.64" dur="4.8">take ownership more and more</text><text start="742.74" dur="4.26">um pre-covet we were in more like the</text><text start="745.44" dur="3.0">Satoshi mindset we were doing everything</text><text start="747.0" dur="3.6">hidden and</text><text start="748.44" dur="4.74">sneaky maybe it&apos;s hard to imagine for</text><text start="750.6" dur="4.08">some people but I would say pre-2020 you</text><text start="753.18" dur="4.14">really shouldn&apos;t have spoken about</text><text start="754.68" dur="4.5">crypto too often it was a little bit</text><text start="757.32" dur="4.8">scary to talk about it you were afraid</text><text start="759.18" dur="4.98">it you&apos;d get robbed or sued or

start="777.18" dur="2.88">coins keep it close to you that&apos;s the</text><text start="778.98" dur="3.18">beauty of this technology but</text><text start="780.06" dur="4.38">essentially what happened was we</text><text start="782.16" dur="3.96">realized that this problem and it isn&apos;t</text><text start="784.44" dur="3.72">just curious like I mentioned there&apos;s 22</text><text start="786.12" dur="4.86">more than 20 countries that have a</text><text start="788.16" dur="4.2">similar system and over 75 that have an</text><text start="790.98" dur="3.539">anchor or a soft anchor to another</text><text start="792.36" dur="3.9">currency so this is a global problem</text><text start="794.519" dur="3.541">that many many countries are</text><text start="796.26" dur="3.18">experiencing especially developing</text><text start="798.06" dur="3.12">countries</text><text start="799.44" dur="4.38">um so we realize that we need to step up</text><text start="801.18" dur="5.339">and take ownership of this problem we</text><text start="803.82" dur="5.1">participated in the anovathon by the</text><text start="806.519" dur="4.201">local government and we&apos;ve ordered first</text><text start="808.92" dur="3.359">time imagined the system of Colectivo</text><text start="810.72" dur="3.72">which means collective in the local</text><text start="812.279" dur="4.56">language where we created this let&apos;s</text><text start="814.44" dur="4.26">call it a circular economy where the</text><text start="816.839" dur="4.5">community creates value tokenizes some</text><text start="818.7" dur="5.22">of that value and utilizes again to fund</text><text start="821.339" dur="5.881">the next wave of of development</text><text start="823.92" dur="6.12">um and we won we won the an avaton and I</text><text start="827.22" dur="5.04">was shocked so I asked as the government</text><text start="830.04" dur="4.919">people do you understand what I&apos;m saying</text><text start="832.26" dur="4.139">because I&apos;m saying very scary stuff and</text><text start="834.959" dur="3.541">they said we don&apos;t completely understand</text><text start="836.399" dur="4.861">it but we understand the problem and we</text><text start="838.5" dur="4.74">want a solution just as bad as you do so</text><text start="841.26" dur="4.079">please here&apos;s price money I think it was</text><text start="843.24" dur="3.96">like 10 it was a very low amount</text><text start="845.339" dur="4.381">um but they wanted us to continue and</text><text start="847.2" dur="5.1">that gave me the confidence to go out</text><text start="849.72" dur="4.32">um scale my team I was already working</text><text start="852.3" dur="4.2">um width and four doubts around that</text><text start="854.04" dur="5.64">time to build up capacity resources to</text><text start="856.5" dur="6.0">third Collective into reality and that</text><text start="859.68" dur="4.8">kind of all accelerated in 2021</text><text start="862.5" dur="4.62">um we received a grant from fuse and</text><text start="864.48" dur="4.56">then later on a grant from Cello which</text><text start="867.12" dur="4.08">is a layer 1 blockchain focused on</text><text start="869.04" dur="4.2">enabling Prosperity</text><text start="871.2" dur="4.319">um and they gave us a grant um for us to</text><text start="873.24" dur="4.38">imagine the system we came back with a</text><text start="875.519" dur="4.201">white paper and prototype and they told</text><text start="877.62" dur="3.779">us wow this is incredible</text><text start="879.72" dur="4.02">um this is exactly what we hoped to</text><text start="881.399" dur="4.44">achieve with cello let us know how we</text><text start="883.74" dur="4.14">can help that turned into a strategic</text><text start="885.839" dur="3.661">round which we have been using for the</text><text start="887.88" dur="3.78">past 12 months to get us to the stage</text><text start="889.5" dur="4.56">where we are today and that stages that</text><text start="891.66" dur="4.26">we just went live with our MVP two weeks</text><text start="894.06" dur="4.56">ago and in q1 we will have the full</text><text start="895.92" dur="5.4">system ready which includes the toolkit</text><text start="898.62" dur="5.279">for creating managing local community</text><text start="901.32" dur="4.319">currencies a user-friendly wallet</text><text start="903.899" dur="5.161">focused on real world users and</text><text start="905.639" dur="5.88">Merchants and a system to tokenize</text><text start="909.06" dur="3.719">ecological assets where we use a new</text><text start="911.519" dur="3.18">standard that we developed called the</text><text start="912.779" dur="4.081">Geo nft which we did together with</text><text start="914.699" dur="4.681">astral protocol there&apos;s a whole bunch</text><text start="916.86" dur="4.08">finally coming together and then once we</text><text start="919.38" dur="2.94">have established that then it&apos;s on to</text><text start="920.94" dur="4.019">scaling to four to eight other</text><text start="922.32" dur="5.28">jurisdictions and gather as much input</text><text start="924.959" dur="4.68">as we can to hopefully turn this into a</text><text start="927.6" dur="3.9">global scalable solution that can go</text><text start="929.639" dur="4.32">around the world</text><text start="931.5" dur="4.139">beautiful well there&apos;s a lot there um</text><text start="933.959" dur="3.841">there&apos;s two things that I really want to</text><text start="935.639" dur="5.041">unpack the mechanism nerd in me is</text><text start="937.8" dur="5.46">really excited to talk about Geo nfts in</text><text start="940.68" dur="4.14">the mechanism behind that</text><text start="943.26" dur="3.54">um and basically how governance</text><text start="944.82" dur="4.139">verification the Geo nft and</text><text start="946.8" dur="4.08">environmental monitoring understanding</text><text start="948.959" dur="4.921">the material reality works so the</text><text start="950.88" dur="5.22">mechanism nerd is is sort of half a for</text><text start="953.88" dur="4.079">me but then the path B is taking these</text><text start="956.1" dur="3.72">crypto tools and putting them in the</text><text start="957.959" dur="4.461">hands of those who are not only</text><text start="959.82" dur="6.24">non-crypto but maybe are even</text><text start="962.42" dur="4.96">non-tech native and so I know Choose</text><text start="966.06" dur="3.54">Your Own Adventure where should where</text><text start="967.38" dur="4.92">should we dig in on first let&apos;s start</text><text start="969.6" dur="5.4">with the mechanism near its side I think</text><text start="972.3" dur="4.86">that&apos;s that&apos;s exciting to start with</text><text start="975.0" dur="3.66">okay let&apos;s do it so so how does the</text><text start="977.16" dur="4.14">mechanism work I feel like that&apos;s like a</text><text start="978.66" dur="5.22">five word question that is gonna unlock</text><text start="981.3" dur="3.96">like 15 minutes of conversation but but</text><text start="983.88" dur="3.72">yeah at the mechanism at a very high</text><text start="985.26" dur="5.1">level how does it work</text><text start="987.6" dur="4.38">so one something that&apos;s very um</text><text start="990.36" dur="4.38">foundational to Collective when our</text><text start="991.98" dur="4.979">approach is this focus on local there&apos;s</text><text start="994.74" dur="5.039">focus on making it as real and tangible</text><text start="996.959" dur="4.201">as possible and embedding it into the</text><text start="999.779" dur="2.521">real world</text><text start="1001.16" dur="3.299">um and one thing that that&apos;s always</text><text start="1002.3" dur="4.02">frustrated us about traditional natural</text><text start="1004.459" dur="5.701">asset markets or carbon markets and what</text><text start="1006.32" dur="5.459">so is how opaque and Abstract it is</text><text start="1010.16" dur="3.299">um it seems rather disconnected from</text><text start="1011.779" dur="3.3">reality more than it is connected to</text><text start="1013.459" dur="3.18">reality</text><text start="1015.079" dur="3.841">um so what we&apos;re trying to do is really</text><text start="1016.639" dur="4.981">embed this as close as possible into</text><text start="1018.92" dur="5.1">reality and and make you feel even</text><text start="1021.62" dur="4.079">through the web that you understand the</text><text start="1024.02" dur="3.659">physical context of this</text><text start="1025.699" dur="4.021">so what we have done is we&apos;ve worked</text><text start="1027.679" dur="3.601">together with astral protocol</text><text start="1029.72" dur="4.44">um they have an amazing team and they&apos;re</text><text start="1031.28" dur="4.98">specialists at spatial smart contracts</text><text start="1034.16" dur="4.74">so those are smart contracts that are</text><text start="1036.26" dur="5.1">connected to a specific geographic area</text><text start="1038.9" dur="4.439">or steel spatial area</text><text start="1041.36" dur="6.0">and we&apos;re creating the standard called</text><text start="1043.339" dur="6.421">Geo nft that is able to store data of a</text><text start="1047.36" dur="4.98">specific geographic location so let&apos;s</text><text start="1049.76" dur="5.1">imagine a reef structure we&apos;re first</text><text start="1052.34" dur="5.339">going to set out the parameters of the</text><text start="1054.86" dur="3.96">geographic location of the refractor</text><text start="1057.679" dur="2.821">um let&apos;s say Melody it&apos;s a hundred</text><text start="1058.82" dur="4.02">square square meters</text><text start="1060.5" dur="4.559">now we&apos;re going to deploy different</text><text start="1062.84" dur="4.8">methods to gather information or data</text><text start="1065.059" dur="4.5">from this restructure</text><text start="1067.64" dur="4.62">um the methods we&apos;re combining right now</text><text start="1069.559" dur="5.701">are satellite data</text><text start="1072.26" dur="4.44">um iot devices underground input and</text><text start="1075.26" dur="3.96">weather stations</text><text start="1076.7" dur="5.28">and we combine those four kind of data</text><text start="1079.22" dur="4.26">streams into this gnfd which then</text><text start="1081.98" dur="3.18">provides you with an almost live</text><text start="1083.48" dur="4.199">up-to-date</text><text start="1085.16" dur="5.519">um score of what we call the ecological</text><text start="1087.679" dur="7.041">index or the the well-being of this</text><text start="1090.679" dur="4.041">natural public good hmm</text><text start="1098.679" dur="5.261">what this allows you to do is now you</text><text start="1102.14" dur="3.84">don&apos;t just have a story of this but you</text><text start="1103.94" dur="3.42">have also a transferable store because</text><text start="1105.98" dur="4.62">it&apos;s an nft</text><text start="1107.36" dur="6.42">so what we do is based on the</text><text start="1110.6" dur="5.579">um square meters of this position we&apos;re</text><text start="1113.78" dur="4.2">going to issue an x amount of tokens so</text><text start="1116.179" dur="5.301">let&apos;s imagine 100 square meters you can</text><text start="1117.98" dur="6.12">issue 100 tokens out of this nft</text><text start="1121.48" dur="5.079">now what you can do with these tokens</text><text start="1124.1" dur="4.26">are different things in our case the</text><text start="1126.559" dur="3.601">majority of the tokens first go in the</text><text start="1128.36" dur="4.02">hands of those doing the interventions</text><text start="1130.16" dur="4.56">which is again very different from</text><text start="1132.38" dur="4.26">traditional markets if you are buying</text><text start="1134.72" dur="5.04">carbon credits the people on the ground</text><text start="1136.64" dur="5.46">doing the work only get this a tiny</text><text start="1139.76" dur="4.14">fraction of the value created there&apos;s a</text><text start="1142.1" dur="4.68">trillion middleman there&apos;s governments</text><text start="1143.9" dur="4.62">there&apos;s bureaucracy in the middle that</text><text start="1146.78" dur="5.34">takes the majority of the value away</text><text start="1148.52" dur="6.18">it&apos;s it&apos;s more like a will game than a</text><text start="1152.12" dur="4.32">um worker game that makes sense</text><text start="1154.7" dur="3.479">so what we&apos;re doing is first we&apos;re</text><text start="1156.44" dur="3.359">issuing these tokens to those that are</text><text start="1158.179" dur="3.12">actually taking the action a small</text><text start="1159.799" dur="4.141">fraction goes to the collective Network</text><text start="1161.299" dur="4.5">for Market making purposes but then what</text><text start="1163.94" dur="4.02">you can do with these tokens is we&apos;ve</text><text start="1165.799" dur="4.441">created this impact map which gives you</text><text start="1167.96" dur="3.36">a complete overview of all the Geo nfts</text><text start="1170.24" dur="3.0">in existence</text><text start="1171.32" dur="4.26">okay and you can purchase some of these</text><text start="1173.24" dur="4.74">Geo nfts and stake them into a specific</text><text start="1175.58" dur="3.42">location so the location that you that</text><text start="1177.98" dur="3.24">you own</text><text start="1179.0" dur="3.9">and that&apos;s what gives you output rights</text><text start="1181.22" dur="3.839">for that specific

is</text><text start="1280.76" dur="4.44">connected to some sort of environmental</text><text start="1282.76" dur="5.98">monitoring of the underlying material</text><text start="1285.2"

other</text><text start="1293.9" dur="6.24">material reality and that nft has more</text><text start="1296.48" dur="5.76">value if the uh material reality is more</text><text start="1300.14" dur="4.38">healthy biologically and that creates a</text><text start="1302.24" dur="5.28">financial incentive for a capital class</text><text start="1304.52" dur="6.18">to collect the nfts regenerate the</text><text start="1307.52" dur="4.2">economy and then they they make a profit</text><text start="1310.7" dur="3.18">by doing that so you&apos;re basically</text><text start="1311.72" dur="5.339">connecting the the profit motive of</text><text start="1313.88" dur="5.76">people to the underlying material</text><text start="1317.059" dur="4.74">reality am I close you&apos;re very close</text><text start="1319.64" dur="4.2">that&apos;s as good as it can get basically</text><text start="1321.799" dur="3.901">and and I think on the up another</text><text start="1323.84" dur="4.14">episode you did a session on</text><text start="1325.7" dur="4.44">superstructures and I think there it</text><text start="1327.98" dur="4.62">also came down a lot to values and</text><text start="1330.14" dur="4.62">embedding values that are regenerative</text><text start="1332.6" dur="4.68">by nature and that&apos;s really what we&apos;re</text><text start="1334.76" dur="4.56">trying to do here in theory or at a</text><text start="1337.28" dur="4.379">start you can use our toolkit with just</text><text start="1339.32" dur="3.839">US dollar backing you can mint the</text><text start="1341.659" dur="3.781">community currency backed by US dollar</text><text start="1343.159" dur="4.621">or eat or Bitcoin or whatever</text><text start="1345.44" dur="5.76">but fundamentally those assets are not</text><text start="1347.78" dur="6.0">as regenerative as ecological Assets in</text><text start="1351.2" dur="4.859">your own community so starting with what</text><text start="1353.78" dur="4.68">works today but then slowly gravitating</text><text start="1356.059" dur="3.721">towards uh what we would like it to be</text><text start="1358.46" dur="3.9">that&apos;s kind of the vision and kind of</text><text start="1359.78" dur="5.1">the way that we hope the skill is</text><text start="1362.36" dur="5.1">right</text><text start="1364.88" dur="5.46">um and you know of the live examples the</text><text start="1367.46" dur="4.68">in the pilot what specific use case a</text><text start="1370.34" dur="3.78">material reality is is being measured in</text><text start="1372.14" dur="4.26">the pilot and and where</text><text start="1374.12" dur="3.72">yeah so um a lot of it is in the</text><text start="1376.4" dur="4.2">Caribbean and we actually also had a</text><text start="1377.84" dur="4.92">group that went to Kenya for a time</text><text start="1380.6" dur="4.68">um the first and most real use case that</text><text start="1382.76" dur="5.46">we&apos;re starting with is agroforestry it&apos;s</text><text start="1385.28" dur="5.279">a form of Return of Agriculture</text><text start="1388.22" dur="4.92">um that is very real in especially the</text><text start="1390.559" dur="3.901">Caribbean and South America and</text><text start="1393.14" dur="4.8">especially for these small Islands</text><text start="1394.46" dur="5.16">there&apos;s a big food deficit on our Island</text><text start="1397.94" dur="3.78">for example you can pay up to four</text><text start="1399.62" dur="4.62">dollars for one apple because we don&apos;t</text><text start="1401.72" dur="4.319">have the supply chains for it</text><text start="1404.24" dur="3.78">um so there&apos;s a very real need on the</text><text start="1406.039" dur="3.421">ground for fresh fresh fruits and</text><text start="1408.02" dur="2.94">vegetables</text><text start="1409.46" dur="3.199">um and then we combined it with the</text><text start="1410.96" dur="3.719">agroforestry methodology because</text><text start="1412.659" dur="4.421">agroforestry doesn&apos;t just create good</text><text start="1414.679" dur="3.961">fruits or vegetables it also increases</text><text start="1417.08" dur="3.479">the biodiversity it provides better</text><text start="1418.64" dur="4.8">Water Management</text><text start="1420.559" dur="4.381">um it&apos;s essentially a way that it&apos;s</text><text start="1423.44" dur="3.06">regenerative by Nature it really allows</text><text start="1424.94" dur="3.06">you to plant one foot forward so it&apos;s</text><text start="1426.5" dur="3.059">going to make it easier to plant the</text><text start="1428.0" dur="3.48">next system</text><text start="1429.559" dur="4.441">um we&apos;re also working already now on</text><text start="1431.48" dur="4.199">Reef methodologies because we have a lot</text><text start="1434.0" dur="3.74">of reefs in our</text><text start="1435.679" dur="4.321">um territory as fashioned the Caribbean</text><text start="1437.74" dur="3.76">and the third methodology is also</text><text start="1440.0" dur="4.62">already in its works and that&apos;s</text><text start="1441.5" dur="4.98">mangroves and mangroves is a real</text><text start="1444.62" dur="3.179">um you could call it power farmer like</text><text start="1446.48" dur="3.12">this is like the yield Farm material</text><text start="1447.799" dur="6.0">traditionally look for in defy because</text><text start="1449.6" dur="5.939">in mangrove forest can sacrific a lot of</text><text start="1453.799" dur="3.961">carbon way more than you would expect</text><text start="1455.539" dur="4.741">and in addition to that they also</text><text start="1457.76" dur="5.82">provide a good shelter for</text><text start="1460.28" dur="5.519">um growing fish and and other species so</text><text start="1463.58" dur="4.02">this is really a super asset that any</text><text start="1465.799" dur="3.301">country would like to have more of it</text><text start="1467.6" dur="3.24">also protects you against storms and</text><text start="1469.1" dur="3.24">surges so it&apos;s really</text><text start="1470.84" dur="4.199">um those are the three let&apos;s call them</text><text start="1472.34" dur="5.52">asset types that we are focused on in</text><text start="1475.039" dur="4.201">the coming year but you would imagine as</text><text start="1477.86" dur="4.199">this system starts starts getting</text><text start="1479.24" dur="5.58">globally that other localities may want</text><text start="1482.059" dur="5.821">to optimize for other types of assets so</text><text start="1484.82" dur="5.339">maybe sorry go ahead no no go for it</text><text start="1487.88" dur="4.32">yeah I mean I was going to say um</text><text start="1490.159" dur="3.421">have you found</text><text start="1492.2" dur="2.7">I mean I guess you just launched the</text><text start="1493.58" dur="3.78">pilot so maybe this isn&apos;t a fair</text><text start="1494.9" dur="5.04">question but have you found that</text><text start="1497.36" dur="4.38">um actually holding the nft actually</text><text start="1499.94" dur="3.9">changes the actions of the Speculator</text><text start="1501.74" dur="4.319">class such that they&apos;re investing in</text><text start="1503.84" dur="3.6">cleaning up these ecosystems in the</text><text start="1506.059" dur="2.701">material reality and I guess I&apos;m just</text><text start="1507.44" dur="3.239">wondering about</text><text start="1508.76" dur="4.08">um you know I know that all capital is</text><text start="1510.679" dur="4.62">sort of competing for yield in a</text><text start="1512.84" dur="3.66">financial set I&apos;m sort of like a</text><text start="1515.299" dur="3.421">computer software engineer that&apos;s</text><text start="1516.5" dur="4.62">learning Finance as I am in this space</text><text start="1518.72" dur="3.78">but you know like if there&apos;s easier</text><text start="1521.12" dur="3.12">lower hanging fruit yield available</text><text start="1522.5" dur="3.96">elsewhere then I know that sometimes</text><text start="1524.24" dur="4.2">Capital will skip</text><text start="1526.46" dur="4.079">um higher hanging fruit in terms of</text><text start="1528.44" dur="4.02">creating yield and you know I&apos;m just</text><text start="1530.539" dur="4.38">wondering if that theory of if people</text><text start="1532.46" dur="4.319">have a financial incentive to clean up</text><text start="1534.919" dur="3.24">the material reality has actually borne</text><text start="1536.779" dur="4.26">out yet and and how you&apos;re sort of</text><text start="1538.159" dur="5.941">measuring and testing that</text><text start="1541.039" dur="4.681">so of course I&apos;m tempted to say yes I</text><text start="1544.1" dur="4.199">mean I&apos;m incentivized to say yes but I</text><text start="1545.72" dur="4.62">truly believe it does</text><text start="1548.299" dur="3.541">um so for example the island of Curacao</text><text start="1550.34" dur="4.62">they were already investing for four</text><text start="1551.84" dur="4.68">years into this type of Agriculture</text><text start="1554.96" dur="3.9">um even the minister of Economic</text><text start="1556.52" dur="4.98">Development was investing in it and it&apos;s</text><text start="1558.86" dur="4.62">because of this reality that at least</text><text start="1561.5" dur="3.48">for our locality we cannot keep</text><text start="1563.48" dur="3.42">investing in traditional agriculture</text><text start="1564.98" dur="3.96">because one bad year and we&apos;re screwed</text><text start="1566.9" dur="4.32">we need to look at more resilient</text><text start="1568.94" dur="4.2">Alternatives we need to lower risk we</text><text start="1571.22" dur="4.38">need to focus more on regeneration</text><text start="1573.14" dur="5.279">because otherwise it may be our end and</text><text start="1575.6" dur="4.559">I think that more and more people in the</text><text start="1578.419" dur="4.081">world is kind of impact investing I mean</text><text start="1580.159" dur="4.861">climate is a hot topic now I think more</text><text start="1582.5" dur="4.86">and more people realize that there&apos;s a</text><text start="1585.02" dur="6.06">really big existential risk to profit</text><text start="1587.36" dur="5.22">optimization alone and you can only make</text><text start="1591.08" dur="2.699">that bet a couple times because if you</text><text start="1592.58" dur="2.339">keep doing it we&apos;re all screwed</text><text start="1593.779" dur="3.061">eventually</text><text start="1594.919" dur="5.64">um so I think we are seeing a change of</text><text start="1596.84" dur="5.579">Game Theory more than ever where people</text><text start="1600.559" dur="3.841">are real realizing things that are maybe</text><text start="1602.419" dur="3.601">not so important having the latest BMW</text><text start="1604.4" dur="2.879">who the hell carries</text><text start="1606.02" dur="3.06">um that may be a funny story but in the</text><text start="1607.279" dur="3.541">Caribbean traditionally people would</text><text start="1609.08" dur="4.38">take loans to get very expensive cars</text><text start="1610.82" dur="4.68">but live in very small houses because it</text><text start="1613.46" dur="3.719">reaches kind of low Rises your social</text><text start="1615.5" dur="3.48">status</text><text start="1617.179" dur="4.801">um you&apos;d also have a very big TV but a</text><text start="1618.98" dur="4.38">very small house with a broken roof but</text><text start="1621.98" dur="3.36">essentially what you&apos;re seeing now is</text><text start="1623.36" dur="3.96">that people those same people are now</text><text start="1625.34" dur="4.199">realizing that there are other values</text><text start="1627.32" dur="5.06">that are more valuable to them</text><text start="1629.539" dur="6.0">um less stress better food more movement</text><text start="1632.38" dur="4.84">so if you optimize for profit like money</text><text start="1635.539" dur="3.481">dollar profits alone</text><text start="1637.22" dur="3.36">probably not going to be too interested</text><text start="1639.02" dur="3.659">in this because you can make more money</text><text start="1640.58" dur="3.839">investing in the gambling industry for</text><text start="1642.679" dur="4.74">example which is quite big in the</text><text start="1644.419" dur="4.5">Caribbean but if you realize kind of um</text><text start="1647.419" dur="3.0">if you&apos;ve come to some level of</text><text start="1648.919" dur="3.961">awareness then you may be more</text><text start="1650.419" dur="3.781">incentivized to to look at this</text><text start="1652.88" dur="4.08">so it seems like you&apos;re kind of</text><text start="1654.2" dur="4.56">targeting Capital that maybe has a stake</text><text start="1656.96" dur="3.9">in that local community not just a</text><text start="1658.76" dur="4.56">global pool of capital like no one from</text><text start="1660.86" dur="4.38">wall Street&apos;s gonna gonna swing in and</text><text start="1663.32" dur="3.66">start regenerating local communities on</text><text start="1665.24" dur="4.559">the ground at least not yet and it&apos;s</text><text start="1666.98" dur="4.74">more about targeting local uh local</text><text start="1669.799" dur="3.48">capital and maybe there&apos;s an angle there</text><text start="1671.72" dur="3.059">where like like you said if they get</text><text start="1673.279" dur="3.121">more Social Capital from having a bigger</text><text start="1674.779" dur="4.201">car maybe they get more social capital</text><text start="1676.4" dur="5.279">in their Community also by regenerating</text><text start="1678.98" dur="4.199">their their Community 100 that&apos;s</text><text start="1681.679" dur="2.88">actually how this whole thing started I</text><text start="1683.179" dur="3.541">remember like four or five years ago</text><text start="1684.559" dur="4.021">still super young and I and one day I</text><text start="1686.72" dur="3.959">was just shouting to my friends like it</text><text start="1688.58" dur="3.9">just needs to be easy to be good good</text><text start="1690.679" dur="2.941">needs to be cool</text><text start="1692.48" dur="3.42">um yeah and I think we&apos;re slowly getting</text><text start="1693.62" dur="4.14">there being a regen is now cool where</text><text start="1695.9" dur="4.259">two years ago being a Degen you were to</text><text start="1697.76" dur="4.279">OG now we&apos;re looking at the industry and</text><text start="1700.159" dur="5.041">again this week again we&apos;re showing that</text><text start="1702.039" dur="5.62">degenerative design or degenerative</text><text start="1705.2" dur="4.2">values are really fun and fun in the</text><text start="1707.659" dur="3.541">early days but over the long run it&apos;s</text><text start="1709.4" dur="3.48">gonna come back at you and it&apos;s way</text><text start="1711.2" dur="3.719">cooler and more fun to be regen with</text><text start="1712.88" dur="5.7">your friends and really build a better</text><text start="1714.919" dur="6.181">future but essentially</text><text start="1718.58" dur="4.62">um yes I do think that we are looking</text><text start="1721.1" dur="4.079">for a certain type of capital but also</text><text start="1723.2" dur="4.2">in addition to that because of the power</text><text start="1725.179" dur="5.221">of defy we&apos;re able to abstract this away</text><text start="1727.4" dur="4.68">to higher levels so for example um we&apos;re</text><text start="1730.4" dur="4.32">already looking at solutions to pull</text><text start="1732.08" dur="3.719">different locations together into like</text><text start="1734.72" dur="3.059">an index</text><text start="1735.799" dur="3.841">and then you can again make an index of</text><text start="1737.779" dur="3.241">that index and you could potentially if</text><text start="1739.64" dur="5.519">you&apos;re still make an index of that index</text><text start="1741.02" dur="5.82">so then at the very bottom the um assets</text><text start="1745.159" dur="2.821">that you&apos;re buying are food forests in</text><text start="1746.84" dur="3.24">Curacao</text><text start="1747.98" dur="4.439">but what you&apos;re buying at the top is</text><text start="1750.08" dur="4.56">just an ecological index and that may be</text><text start="1752.419" dur="3.721">of interest to you so we&apos;re not going to</text><text start="1754.64" dur="4.259">sell

FTX</text><text start="2111.28" dur="3.24">um then you have others that you can</text><text start="2112.66" dur="4.32">implicitly rely on so not just having</text><text start="2114.52" dur="4.559">one

dur="3.72">supporting the commons then there&apos;s</text><text start="2125.68" dur="5.159">anti-fragility in that so I was kind of</text><text start="2127.839" dur="5.28">wondering are our two Theses about uh</text><text start="2130.839" dur="4.5">these economic incentives compatible in</text><text start="2133.119" dur="4.201">and if so do they stack uh to be more</text><text start="2135.339" dur="4.26">than the sum of their parts</text><text start="2137.32" dur="4.259">I think they&apos;re compatible for sure so a</text><text start="2139.599" dur="4.141">lot of my insights actually come

dur="4.02">with these things</text><text start="2147.099" dur="4.081">um and I think I once wanted to write so</text><text start="2149.56" dur="3.18">I also did a lot of work with prime down</text><text start="2151.18" dur="3.96">and kind of doubted out coordination and</text><text start="2152.74" dur="4.44">my thesis was always that by tearing</text><text start="2155.14" dur="3.6">this into a network of networks we</text><text start="2157.18" dur="3.72">become more resilient we become more</text><text start="2158.74" dur="3.42">anti-fragile and we can do better I</text><text start="2160.9" dur="3.36">think we actually had a token swap with</text><text start="2162.16" dur="3.78">Git coin as well so I think our thesis</text><text start="2164.26" dur="4.079">kind of of the organizations also shows</text><text start="2165.94" dur="4.62">that we we shared that</text><text start="2168.339" dur="5.341">um but I think again bringing it down it</text><text start="2170.56" dur="4.74">this resiliency is so critical</text><text start="2173.68" dur="4.26">um and the open source nature of web3</text><text start="2175.3" dur="4.74">makes it so

start="2182.859" dur="4.381">um but I do think that the part that is</text><text start="2184.9" dur="5.4">also important is the trade-offs between</text><text start="2187.24" dur="5.52">giving people

this this modularity and</text><text start="2201.94" dur="4.32">this kind of pluralism is extremely</text><text start="2203.8" dur="4.98">important but we also need to make sure</text><text

there&apos;s such</text><text start="2321.099" dur="5.941">a diverse set of of users and everybody</text><text start="2323.74" dur="4.859">needs their own kind of touch so</text><text start="2327.04" dur="3.299">um as a starting point I would say</text><text start="2328.599" dur="4.321">people that</text><text start="2330.339" dur="5.041">the less pre-programmed you are the</text><text start="2332.92" dur="4.8">easier it is to onboard so young people</text><text start="2335.38" dur="4.199">easy they don&apos;t care about Banks they</text><text start="2337.72" dur="3.42">don&apos;t care about anything you show them</text><text start="2339.579" dur="4.201">an app that can do things and they do</text><text start="2341.14" dur="4.14">the things they don&apos;t care that much</text><text start="2343.78" dur="3.66">um so that one is rather easy I think</text><text start="2345.28" dur="3.6">it&apos;s just marketing it to them they&apos;ll</text><text start="2347.44" dur="3.419">adopt it if they like it if not they</text><text start="2348.88" dur="4.5">don&apos;t do it that&apos;s good</text><text start="2350.859" dur="5.041">um I think the parts that I am most or</text><text start="2353.38" dur="3.12">more excited about is</text><text start="2355.9" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="2356.5" dur="4.74">commercial individuals so let&apos;s say</text><text start="2358.9" dur="4.02">small business owners</text><text start="2361.24" dur="4.26">um onboarding them has also been</text><text start="2362.92" dur="4.08">relatively easy because traditionally</text><text start="2365.5" dur="3.42">the financial infrastructure in these</text><text start="2367.0" dur="3.42">places isn&apos;t great they&apos;re not used to</text><text start="2368.92" dur="3.84">things like cash app or like instant</text><text start="2370.42" dur="3.84">transfer or cross-border transfer or</text><text start="2372.76" dur="4.8">anything in a direction that we</text><text start="2374.26" dur="5.28">westerners are spoiled with I would say</text><text start="2377.56" dur="4.38">um so giving them the utility so</text><text start="2379.54" dur="4.2">depending on on their desires but for</text><text start="2381.94" dur="3.6">the merchant is really utility</text><text start="2383.74" dur="3.78">this is going to give you more clients</text><text start="2385.54" dur="3.18">you&apos;re going to pay less fees it&apos;s going</text><text start="2387.52" dur="2.819">to be faster your business is going to</text><text start="2388.72" dur="2.82">run better they&apos;re not going to argue</text><text start="2390.339" dur="2.581">with you that&apos;s all they want they don&apos;t</text><text start="2391.54" dur="3.059">care about the tech they don&apos;t care</text><text start="2392.92" dur="3.3">about Moses don&apos;t even care about law</text><text start="2394.599" dur="3.121">they&apos;ll literally say oh yeah no just do</text><text start="2396.22" dur="2.76">it don&apos;t come if after me if they don&apos;t</text><text start="2397.72" dur="2.82">like it</text><text start="2398.98" dur="3.0">um but the thing that they really need</text><text start="2400.54" dur="3.78">is utility</text><text start="2401.98" dur="4.859">now you have another class that&apos;s let&apos;s</text><text start="2404.32" dur="5.039">say the culturally let&apos;s call them the</text><text start="2406.839" dur="4.201">woke the woke class the people that are</text><text start="2409.359" dur="3.121">already aware that the climate needs</text><text start="2411.04" dur="3.24">help that we need to shift our</text><text start="2412.48" dur="5.28">priorities</text><text start="2414.28" dur="5.7">um to them it&apos;s a more of a vision cell</text><text start="2417.76" dur="4.98">like you need to explain to them why</text><text start="2419.98" dur="4.379">this app that they don&apos;t care about is</text><text start="2422.74" dur="3.72">going to help them accomplish this</text><text start="2424.359" dur="4.021">vision of a</text><text start="2426.46" dur="4.619">um more regenerative or better stewarded</text><text start="2428.38" dur="5.459">world and that&apos;s a bit more education so</text><text start="2431.079" dur="4.5">it&apos;s really starting with this is not</text><text start="2433.839" dur="3.721">Bitcoin we&apos;re not using electricity</text><text start="2435.579" dur="3.721">that&apos;s already that already takes half</text><text start="2437.56" dur="4.08">an hour because a lot of them are</text><text start="2439.3" dur="3.72">pre-programmed to say oh no crypto is</text><text start="2441.64" dur="2.459">bad I actually went to an impact</text><text start="2443.02" dur="2.7">conference</text><text start="2444.099" dur="3.24">um I think it was nine months ago in the</text><text start="2445.72" dur="3.359">Netherlands it&apos;s got Netherland for</text><text start="2447.339" dur="3.481">impact it was like all the young impact</text><text start="2449.079" dur="4.081">people in the Netherlands and I asked</text><text start="2450.82" dur="5.22">the question who thinks that crypto does</text><text start="2453.16" dur="5.16">more harm than it does good and I kid</text><text start="2456.04" dur="4.799">you not 95 of the people raise their</text><text start="2458.32" dur="5.4">hand they all thought that this was a</text><text start="2460.839" dur="4.921">scam that this was bad for nature and I</text><text start="2463.72" dur="4.02">went into arguments with them that hey</text><text start="2465.76" dur="3.78">these traditional financial and</text><text start="2467.74" dur="3.96">coordination structures take way more</text><text start="2469.54" dur="4.26">energy and use way more value and</text><text start="2471.7" dur="4.26">Destroy way more things than</text><text start="2473.8" dur="3.36">um even if you compare to bitcoin all</text><text start="2475.96" dur="2.76">the banks in the world with all the</text><text start="2477.16" dur="3.06">government like they they use so much</text><text start="2478.72" dur="3.24">more for coordination and for keeping</text><text start="2480.22" dur="3.42">your systems running</text><text start="2481.96" dur="4.08">um say I think with them it&apos;s more</text><text start="2483.64" dur="5.16">education and then for the average Joe</text><text start="2486.04" dur="6.059">it&apos;s just making sure that the app is</text><text start="2488.8" dur="4.74">useful to them a lot of them so for</text><text start="2492.099" dur="4.621">example the festival that we had two</text><text start="2493.54" dur="5.579">weeks ago we had about 300 people use</text><text start="2496.72" dur="5.58">the wallet only 10 of those were</text><text start="2499.119" dur="5.101">skeptical the other 290 literally were</text><text start="2502.3" dur="3.96">like oh I can use this to buy drinks</text><text start="2504.22" dur="5.46">epic I&apos;m out let me go get some drinks</text><text start="2506.26" dur="4.74">because they generally don&apos;t even want</text><text start="2509.68" dur="3.659">to ask the harder question they don&apos;t</text><text start="2511.0" dur="3.96">care that much they just want utility</text><text start="2513.339" dur="3.841">um when it becomes harder and I need to</text><text start="2514.96" dur="3.6">onboard they need to do this</text><text start="2517.18" dur="3.419">um yeah then you may need to explain</text><text start="2518.56" dur="5.1">better oh who&apos;s storing your money and</text><text start="2520.599" dur="5.041">but generally don&apos;t care that much</text><text start="2523.66" dur="3.3">maybe finally you spoke about private</text><text start="2525.64" dur="3.719">keys and that&apos;s I think one of those</text><text start="2526.96" dur="4.2">examples where it has gone wrong in the</text><text start="2529.359" dur="3.24">past again I&apos;ve onboarded hundreds of</text><text start="2531.16" dur="3.66">people</text><text start="2532.599" dur="4.561">um there are two ways to do it either I</text><text start="2534.82" dur="3.66">make it really fun and secretive and I&apos;m</text><text start="2537.16" dur="3.419">like hey you really need to write this</text><text start="2538.48" dur="3.54">down it&apos;s super important but you can</text><text start="2540.579" dur="3.361">share it with your best friend half of</text><text start="2542.02" dur="3.48">it and the other to have to I&apos;m kind of</text><text start="2543.94" dur="4.38">turning it into something that they feel</text><text start="2545.5" dur="6.0">is almost a little bit naughty like oh</text><text start="2548.32" dur="4.5">I&apos;m I&apos;m keeping it for myself</text><text start="2551.5" dur="3.42">um or on the other side making it super</text><text start="2552.82" dur="4.32">easy so we&apos;re working on a solution to</text><text start="2554.92" dur="4.74">do uh private key abstraction where you</text><text start="2557.14" dur="5.52">can do social recovery and what so</text><text start="2559.66" dur="5.1">um but it is critical to either go all</text><text start="2562.66" dur="3.84">in and explain to them that this is kind</text><text start="2564.76" dur="3.54">of extremely important and they should</text><text start="2566.5" dur="3.48">care of it because otherwise you end up</text><text start="2568.3" dur="3.6">holding your crypto in an exchange and</text><text start="2569.98" dur="3.72">we don&apos;t want that</text><text start="2571.9" dur="2.939">um or making it so simple that they</text><text start="2573.7" dur="3.54">don&apos;t even have to understand what the</text><text start="2574.839" dur="4.26">hell a private key is and that they</text><text start="2577.24" dur="4.32">um generally to understand oh this is my</text><text start="2579.099" dur="4.681">money only I control it and if I need</text><text start="2581.56" dur="4.2">help I need I cannot go to the bank need</text><text start="2583.78" dur="3.9">to go to my friends</text><text start="2585.76" dur="4.62">um which is maybe the another thing that</text><text start="2587.68" dur="4.679">to me as a 25 year old was very</text><text start="2590.38" dur="4.68">confusing that people actually had</text><text start="2592.359" dur="4.5">Bankers that they used to talk to</text><text start="2595.06" dur="3.48">um I&apos;ve never thought of that idea that</text><text start="2596.859" dur="3.661">if something happens with my money that</text><text start="2598.54" dur="3.66">I would call someone and that specific</text><text start="2600.52" dur="2.52">person would help me</text><text start="2602.2" dur="2.879">um but that&apos;s something that we&apos;re</text><text start="2603.04" dur="3.84">actually having to navigate a lot in the</text><text start="2605.079" dur="3.78">Caribbean because people still have to</text><text start="2606.88" dur="3.479">go physically to the bank so then they</text><text start="2608.859" dur="3.841">would ask me like oh if this goes wrong</text><text start="2610.359" dur="4.141">who do I call I&apos;m like no you can&apos;t</text><text start="2612.7" dur="3.96">really call anybody you can maybe</text><text start="2614.5" dur="3.96">message us and we can try to look into</text><text start="2616.66" dur="4.08">it but yeah there&apos;s a lot of different</text><text start="2618.46" dur="6.06">ways to approach that but again I think</text><text start="2620.74" dur="5.28">just having local context makes all</text><text start="2624.52" dur="3.42">these things so much easier because you</text><text start="2626.02" dur="4.74">speak the language you understand the</text><text start="2627.94" dur="4.56">struggles you know their backgrounds and</text><text start="2630.76" dur="4.14">you can much easier to kind of shift</text><text start="2632.5" dur="5.4">them towards a specific Direction</text><text start="2634.9" dur="5.16">well I just feel so lucky because with</text><text start="2637.9" dur="4.199">Git coin we just felt asked backwards</text><text start="2640.06" dur="4.5">into an audience that already understood</text><text start="2642.099" dur="4.321">the utility of crypto private Key</text><text start="2644.56" dur="3.36">Management installed metabass could</text><text start="2646.42" dur="3.899">understand transactions we were serving</text><text start="2647.92" dur="3.78">software engineers and</text><text start="2650.319" dur="3.061">um you know I really just think that</text><text start="2651.7" dur="3.6">like I said get coin sell ass backwards</text><text start="2653.38" dur="4.08">into that audience and it&apos;s one of the</text><text start="2655.3" dur="3.9">reasons why it&apos;s been able to deliver 72</text><text start="2657.46" dur="3.72">million dollars worth of funding for</text><text start="2659.2" dur="4.08">public goods blah blah blah</text><text start="2661.18" dur="4.38">um but um you know when it comes to</text><text start="2663.28" dur="4.2">taking</text><text start="2665.56" dur="3.84">that kind of momentum and bringing it to</text><text start="2667.48" dur="3.72">a novel Community it feels like there&apos;s</text><text start="2669.4" dur="3.78">drivers and there&apos;s barriers the drivers</text><text start="2671.2" dur="3.72">are the reasons why they need a solution</text><text start="2673.18" dur="4.439">for some problem that they have and the</text><text start="2674.92" dur="6.24">barriers are are like learning how to do</text><text start="2677.619" dur="5.281">uh private key management and uh</text><text start="2681.16" dur="3.24">transaction broadcasting and all that</text><text start="2682.9" dur="2.939">kind of stuff</text><text start="2684.4" dur="2.939">um and I feel like a lot of people in</text><text start="2685.839" dur="4.201">this space Focus too much on lowering</text><text start="2687.339" dur="4.381">the barriers and not enough on creating</text><text start="2690.04" dur="3.299">new drivers to get people over the</text><text start="2691.72" dur="3.899">barriers and you know one of the things</text><text start="2693.339" dur="5.641">I see with with you is that there&apos;s just</text><text start="2695.619" dur="5.46">such a driver for having a more regen</text><text start="2698.98" dur="3.78">um Community or it&apos;s a regenerating</text><text start="2701.079" dur="2.941">local communities with Colectivo that</text><text start="2702.76" dur="2.52">people probably natively feel that</text><text start="2704.02" dur="2.52">driver</text><text start="2705.28" dur="3.839">um but I still there&apos;s an open question</text><text start="2706.54" dur="4.02">in my mind about uh is the systems that</text><text start="2709.119" dur="2.941">we&apos;re gonna build for the mainstream are</text><text start="2710.56" dur="3.96">are people going to learn the New</text><text start="2712.06" dur="3.96">Primitives of web3 like in web one we</text><text start="2714.52" dur="3.36">all learned about the home button and</text><text start="2716.02" dur="4.86">the back button and the secure lock that</text><text start="2717.88" dur="4.38">shows me that I&apos;m using https or is it</text><text start="2720.88" dur="2.88">going to be more like the blockchain</text><text start="2722.26" dur="3.839">mullet where it&apos;s like blockchain in the</text><text start="2723.76" dur="3.96">back and it&apos;s web 2 in the front</text><text start="2726.099" dur="3.24">um and it and it seems like it feels</text><text start="2727.72" dur="4.02">more likely that the blockchain mullet</text><text start="2729.339" dur="4.321">is gonna happen to me uh where it feels</text><text start="2731.74" dur="4.02">like a web 2 app or like a native app in</text><text start="2733.66" dur="4.38">the front but uh all of that blockchain</text><text start="2735.76" dur="3.48">stuff is is kind of hidden in the back</text><text start="2738.04" dur="2.64">and</text><text start="2739.24" dur="3.78">um that&apos;s scary to me because the two</text><text start="2740.68" dur="3.72">paradigms don&apos;t exactly fit like once</text><text start="2743.02" dur="3.48">you broadcast something to a blockchain</text><text start="2744.4" dur="4.56">it&apos;s out there forever there is no like</text><text start="2746.5" dur="5.52">customer service just so to contact if</text><text start="2748.96" dur="4.02">you lose your money and so yeah I don&apos;t</text><text start="2752.02" dur="2.46">know if you have anything to add here</text><text start="2752.98" dur="2.76">but this is kind of my traversal of</text><text start="2754.48" dur="2.639">trying to bring this technology to</text><text start="2755.74" dur="3.72">people who aren&apos;t just software</text><text start="2757.119" dur="4.141">engineers I do have a lot of thoughts</text><text start="2759.46" dur="3.659">there I think generally</text><text start="2761.26" dur="4.5">um we&apos;re gonna see some core principles</text><text start="2763.119" dur="4.021">of blockchain to be widely adopted and</text><text start="2765.76" dur="3.359">normalized</text><text start="2767.14" dur="4.02">um think of transparency I think that&apos;s</text><text start="2769.119" dur="3.901">something that is being more and more</text><text start="2771.16" dur="4.5">normalized in these communities and was</text><text start="2773.02" dur="4.98">traditionally not normalized at all</text><text start="2775.66" dur="3.959">um ownership truly being the owner of</text><text start="2778.0" dur="3.599">something is</text><text start="2779.619" dur="3.121">extremely powerful but also new to</text><text start="2781.599" dur="2.341">people</text><text start="2782.74" dur="3.42">um that&apos;s a concept that they will need</text><text start="2783.94" dur="4.5">to learn and get comfortable with</text><text start="2786.16" dur="3.959">um I think digital assets are or are</text><text start="2788.44" dur="3.84">currently already being normalized more</text><text start="2790.119" dur="4.381">and more people understand that they can</text><text start="2792.28" dur="5.039">freely send things and receive things</text><text start="2794.5" dur="5.579">and I think that&apos;s I think nfc&apos;s</text><text start="2797.319" dur="5.401">actually did something really good there</text><text start="2800.079" dur="4.5">um there&apos;s digital governance I think</text><text start="2802.72" dur="4.98">more direct governance is also something</text><text start="2804.579" dur="5.341">that I hope people get more of</text><text start="2807.7" dur="4.98">um but I think besides those let&apos;s say</text><text start="2809.92" dur="5.82">key powers that they&apos;re gaining I don&apos;t</text><text start="2812.68" dur="5.04">want to bother them too much with the</text><text start="2815.74" dur="3.9">technicalities</text><text start="2817.72" dur="4.98">um they should understand what it means</text><text start="2819.64" dur="3.9">to them and what it allows them to do</text><text start="2822.7" dur="2.1">um</text><text start="2823.54" dur="3.539">but they&apos;re probably not all gonna</text><text start="2824.8" dur="4.68">become as technical or being even one to</text><text start="2827.079" dur="4.74">become as technical as we are</text><text start="2829.48" dur="3.66">um as this rolls out</text><text start="2831.819" dur="3.241">um</text><text start="2833.14" dur="3.78">got it</text><text start="2835.06" dur="3.24">well yeah I mean I I think that it&apos;s</text><text start="2836.92" dur="3.419">really important to figure out how to</text><text start="2838.3" dur="3.539">put these hand these tools in more hands</text><text start="2840.339" dur="3.301">so I think that the work you&apos;re doing</text><text start="2841.839" dur="3.181">here is pioneering</text><text start="2843.64" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="2845.02" dur="4.559">I think we only have 10 five minutes</text><text start="2847.06" dur="5.22">left and so I&apos;m I&apos;m wondering if there&apos;s</text><text start="2849.579" dur="4.081">anything that I didn&apos;t ask that you that</text><text start="2852.28" dur="4.16">you want to tell us about with respect</text><text start="2853.66" dur="2.78">to Colectivo</text><text start="2856.72" dur="3.84">I think we covered most of it actually I</text><text start="2858.94" dur="2.58">think we went through the gnft stuff we</text><text start="2860.56" dur="3.0">went through the community currency</text><text start="2861.52" dur="4.38">stuff why that&apos;s important we went</text><text start="2863.56" dur="4.14">through this kind of global vision of uh</text><text start="2865.9" dur="3.56">maybe there&apos;s it&apos;s work kind of</text><text start="2867.7" dur="3.72">highlighting that one more time kind of</text><text start="2869.46" dur="4.359">in the current Community currency</text><text start="2871.42" dur="3.84">systems at our web too they don&apos;t have</text><text start="2873.819" dur="3.421">digital assets they don&apos;t have the fight</text><text start="2875.26" dur="5.28">tools so there&apos;s no connection between</text><text start="2877.24" dur="5.579">let&apos;s say Brixton and Sardinia</text><text start="2880.54" dur="4.74">um there&apos;s also no ability for them to</text><text start="2882.819" dur="3.421">coordinate across deployment let&apos;s say</text><text start="2885.28" dur="2.16">because they don&apos;t have the same</text><text start="2886.24" dur="2.46">standards they don&apos;t have the same</text><text start="2887.44" dur="4.28">method</text><text start="2888.7" dur="4.919">by standardizing some aspects of this</text><text start="2891.72" dur="5.02">but still allowing for local</text><text start="2893.619" dur="5.581">customization what we&apos;re creating is</text><text start="2896.74" dur="4.92">This Global Network that will not only</text><text start="2899.2" dur="4.68">build better software together but can</text><text start="2901.66" dur="4.439">also have digital asset pairings</text><text start="2903.88" dur="3.959">together so</text><text start="2906.099" dur="4.201">um two things are super cool there I</text><text start="2907.839" dur="4.621">think one is we can make markets between</text><text start="2910.3" dur="4.019">let&apos;s say collectivo Brazil and</text><text start="2912.46" dur="3.6">collectivo Curacao through the</text><text start="2914.319" dur="2.641">collective Network token so you can go</text><text start="2916.06" dur="3.539">from</text><text start="2916.96" dur="5.399">curse out to knt and then from knt to</text><text start="2919.599" dur="4.801">Brazil and this makes it a global system</text><text start="2922.359" dur="3.601">where you can actually do good in cursor</text><text start="2924.4" dur="3.3">and then pay what&apos;s for something in</text><text start="2925.96" dur="2.94">Colombia or Brazil</text><text start="2927.7" dur="3.0">um and that&apos;s something that we&apos;ve never</text><text start="2928.9" dur="4.38">seen before in the context of community</text><text start="2930.7" dur="4.8">currencies there are always hyper local</text><text start="2933.28" dur="4.14">but not scalable to the rest of the</text><text start="2935.5" dur="3.599">world and that&apos;s something that now with</text><text start="2937.42" dur="4.199">taxes and with</text><text start="2939.099" dur="3.901">um I spent some time myself at balancer</text><text start="2941.619" dur="3.361">and kind of really getting deep into</text><text start="2943.0" dur="3.96">what you can do with these liquidity</text><text start="2944.98" dur="3.0">pools and I think that&apos;s truly</text><text start="2946.96" dur="3.54">incredible</text><text start="2947.98" dur="3.9">and then</text><text start="2950.5" dur="4.38">um</text><text start="2951.88" dur="3.78">I guess the other part of that is</text><text start="2954.88" dur="2.28">um</text><text start="2955.66" dur="4.439">like I said this bigger vision of</text><text start="2957.16" dur="4.86">collectivo as a global asset and how</text><text start="2960.099" dur="3.0">that will play out</text><text start="2962.02" dur="2.64">um I think that&apos;s also really</text><text start="2963.099" dur="4.381">interesting I really hope that 10 years</text><text start="2964.66" dur="5.34">from now we&apos;ll see different types of</text><text start="2967.48" dur="4.56">structures at the top of Queen gecko</text><text start="2970.0" dur="5.04">which aren&apos;t just</text><text start="2972.04" dur="4.319">um stable coins the layer ones I I</text><text start="2975.04" dur="3.0">really hope that we get to the point</text><text start="2976.359" dur="2.841">where the application itself is so</text><text start="2978.04" dur="2.7">valuable</text><text start="2979.2" dur="3.159">that</text><text start="2980.74" dur="3.54">um yeah that it can get to the top and</text><text start="2982.359" dur="3.96">it&apos;s valued as an application instead of</text><text start="2984.28" dur="5.24">kind of forcing everyone to build the</text><text start="2986.319" dur="3.201">the base infrastructure</text><text start="2990.22" dur="4.5">if I can because yeah I mean we got a</text><text start="2993.4" dur="2.699">few more minutes I mean the thing I just</text><text start="2994.72" dur="3.96">want to remark on is that I&apos;m</text><text start="2996.099" dur="3.72">increasingly</text><text start="2998.68" dur="3.6">um</text><text start="2999.819" dur="4.741">I believe in local currencies and I the</text><text start="3002.28" dur="4.5">reason for that is is that with US</text><text start="3004.56" dur="5.34">Dollars and Bitcoins everything gets its</text><text start="3006.78" dur="5.76">most commoditized form uh you know Bud</text><text start="3009.9" dur="4.32">Light in like bikinis are like the race</text><text start="3012.54" dur="5.1">to the bottom of the brain stem that</text><text start="3014.22" dur="5.04">happens in in like Global ad markets for</text><text start="3017.64" dur="4.74">example and what if we could create</text><text start="3019.26" dur="5.579">local currencies around values that are</text><text start="3022.38" dur="5.88">like this biodiversity of in health of</text><text start="3024.839" dur="5.28">our coral reefs or the the the fish</text><text start="3028.26" dur="3.24">trade in a local area</text><text start="3030.119" dur="2.941">um or they don&apos;t even have to be local</text><text start="3031.5" dur="4.7">geographically but they could be local</text><text start="3033.06" dur="6.299">and value systems like maybe get coins</text><text start="3036.2" dur="5.619">uh you know a a community built around</text><text start="3039.359" dur="5.401">Global public goods and radical is built</text><text start="3041.819" dur="4.861">around open source software and so</text><text start="3044.76" dur="3.54">um I actually think that like At first</text><text start="3046.68" dur="3.6">like you know when bitcoiners call every</text><text start="3048.3" dur="3.299">coin that&apos;s not Bitcoin a coin I</text><text start="3050.28" dur="4.02">always knew that that was wrong because</text><text start="3051.599" dur="5.041">bitcoin&apos;s kind of the first coin</text><text start="3054.3" dur="5.1">um but I actually think that it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="3056.64" dur="5.219">like 180 degrees wrong because what we</text><text start="3059.4" dur="4.74">want is a diversity of local currencies</text><text start="3061.859" dur="4.081">that represent their own value systems</text><text start="3064.14" dur="3.179">that are interoperable can be traded to</text><text start="3065.94" dur="3.6">US dollars if you want to move into the</text><text start="3067.319" dur="3.78">global system so a plurality of those</text><text start="3069.54" dur="4.079">local currencies I see as being a key</text><text start="3071.099" dur="4.801">building block here 100 and I think</text><text start="3073.619" dur="3.901">that&apos;s Freedom right the opportunity to</text><text start="3075.9" dur="3.84">choose what you align with and which</text><text start="3077.52" dur="3.48">values you want to represent and and</text><text start="3079.74" dur="2.879">that brings me all the way back to this</text><text start="3081.0" dur="4.319">initial problem that there are over 80</text><text start="3082.619" dur="5.48">countries that in order to survive need</text><text start="3085.319" dur="5.52">to be packed to a bigger value system</text><text start="3088.099" dur="4.661">that doesn&apos;t share that same symbiotic</text><text start="3090.839" dur="3.681">relationship with them so it&apos;s kind of a</text><text start="3092.76" dur="3.299">one-sided relationship</text><text start="3094.52" dur="3.28">where</text><text start="3096.059" dur="5.101">um every time I do a transaction in</text><text start="3097.8" dur="6.18">Curacao I&apos;m indirectly reinforcing the</text><text start="3101.16" dur="4.8">US hegemony because indirectly I&apos;m</text><text start="3103.98" dur="4.44">reinforcing the US dollar banking system</text><text start="3105.96" dur="4.08">the US dollar to currency even though</text><text start="3108.42" dur="3.899">maybe I don&apos;t want to maybe I have</text><text start="3110.04" dur="4.14">different values but I can&apos;t decide I</text><text start="3112.319" dur="4.26">don&apos;t have another option so this player</text><text start="3114.18" dur="4.679">plurality of value alignments I think</text><text start="3116.579" dur="3.421">that cryptocurrencies have enabled I</text><text start="3118.859" dur="3.421">think it&apos;s potentially even the biggest</text><text start="3120.0" dur="3.48">innovation of all because now you can</text><text start="3122.28" dur="2.88">finally decide what you really care</text><text start="3123.48" dur="3.24">about and spend your energy and</text><text start="3125.16" dur="3.06">resources there</text><text start="3126.72" dur="4.26">um and gain more of that I think that&apos;s</text><text start="3128.22" dur="4.44">incredible and why I really hope that</text><text start="3130.98" dur="3.24">um after this crazy period we&apos;ll see</text><text start="3132.66" dur="3.0">those Thrive again and we can build</text><text start="3134.22" dur="2.7">these systems</text><text start="3135.66" dur="3.679">um yeah to be interconnected and</text><text start="3136.92" dur="2.419">resilient</text><text start="3139.98" dur="4.32">beautiful well it seems like we covered</text><text start="3142.14" dur="4.919">one little lens on the global</text><text start="3144.3" dur="4.98">pluralistic uh world that we can create</text><text start="3147.059" dur="4.681">that supports impact owls and public</text><text start="3149.28" dur="4.02">goods and tragedy of the commons</text><text start="3151.74" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="3153.3" dur="3.96">where can people find Colectivo online</text><text start="3154.98" dur="4.5">and how can they get involved</text><text start="3157.26" dur="5.04">so first to start we don&apos;t have a</text><text start="3159.48" dur="5.4">Discord it&apos;s on purpose
