dur="4.721">so much about public goods i think</text><text start="38.879" dur="4.481">there&apos;s a counter factual world out</text><text start="40.96" dur="4.64">there in which say vitalik wasn&apos;t into</text><text start="43.36" dur="3.76">public goods as much as he was and i</text><text start="45.6" dur="4.08">think that the ethereum community would</text><text start="47.12" dur="4.959">be missing some of its vibrancy and</text><text start="49.68" dur="6.32">community-centric nature that it has</text><text start="52.079" dur="6.16">these days because vitalik&apos;s

dur="4.72">really wanted to dig in on how he views</text><text start="62.48" dur="4.639">public goods why public goods are good</text><text start="65.04" dur="4.48">and which experiments in the community</text><text start="67.119" dur="4.881">he thinks about having the most promise</text><text start="69.52" dur="4.959">for funding public goods and the just</text><text start="72.0" dur="4.88">salt of all of those things together</text><text start="74.479" dur="5.201">obviously vitalik beyond just being a</text><text start="76.88" dur="4.559">champion of the ethereum ecosystem also</text><text start="79.68" dur="4.079">wrote the quadratic funding white paper</text><text start="81.439" dur="4.481">with glenn weil as you all know</text><text start="83.759" dur="5.201">quadratic funding is a foundational part</text><text start="85.92" dur="4.8">of bitcoin and uh i think that there&apos;s a</text><text start="88.96" dur="4.0">lot of interesting surface

dur="4.08">um thank you kevin it&apos;s good to be here</text><text start="211.599" dur="3.521">great to have you vitalik your</text><text start="213.28" dur="3.76">background and how you came to found</text><text start="215.12" dur="4.32">ethereum is well documented in the</text><text start="217.04" dur="3.919">infinite machine book and elsewhere so</text><text start="219.44" dur="3.68">in this space i want to focus on your</text><text start="220.959" dur="4.241">advocacy for public goods</text><text start="223.12" dur="4.8">and your talk things that matter outside</text><text start="225.2" dur="4.72">of d5 that you gave at ecc this year</text><text start="227.92" dur="4.0">um i think that the natural starting</text><text start="229.92" dur="4.399">place for me and you to start talking</text><text start="231.92" dur="4.399">about these themes is quadratic funding</text><text start="234.319" dur="3.84">bitcoin grants is built off of the</text><text start="236.319" dur="4.64">research paper you did with glenn weil</text><text start="238.159" dur="3.521">on quadratic funding uh how did you come</text><text start="240.959" dur="2.721">to</text><text start="241.68" dur="3.36">conceive of quadratic funding with glenn</text><text start="243.68" dur="4.08">and how do you see it evolving in the</text><text start="245.04" dur="5.119">future um and i guess like well glenn</text><text start="247.76" dur="5.44">originally came up with the idea for</text><text start="250.159" dur="4.881">quadratic voting um and</text><text start="253.2" dur="3.52">that well he was one of the people who</text><text start="255.04" dur="4.479">came up with that idea actually um there</text><text start="256.72" dur="4.639">were uh it turned it later turned out</text><text start="259.519" dur="3.921">that there were a whole bunch of uh</text><text start="261.359" dur="4.641">historical papers that pointed to uh</text><text start="263.44" dur="4.319">very similar ideas which uh</text><text start="266.0" dur="4.639">actually happens really often for the uh</text><text start="267.759" dur="5.121">for for the best ideas and there&apos;s uh</text><text start="270.639" dur="5.521">one from i think</text><text start="272.88" dur="5.68">1980 um talking about why quadratic</text><text start="276.16" dur="4.4">voting is like the theoretically optimal</text><text start="278.56" dur="3.76">voting rule there&apos;s a whole um there</text><text start="280.56" dur="3.84">might be a couple of other ones um about</text><text start="282.32" dur="4.48">glenn made kind of the</text><text start="284.4" dur="3.84">best and most detailed exposition and um</text><text start="286.8" dur="3.04">i think it was a paper that he yeah</text><text start="288.24" dur="4.0">published like sometime between five and</text><text start="289.84" dur="4.72">ten years ago um and</text><text start="292.24" dur="4.88">quadratic funding was uh</text><text start="294.56" dur="5.52">an adaptation of the ideas behind</text><text start="297.12" dur="4.16">quadratic voting to the context of uh</text><text start="300.08" dur="2.399">public goods</text><text start="301.28" dur="3.04">um so</text><text start="302.479" dur="3.921">i think one of the really big</text><text start="304.32" dur="4.0">differences between quadratic voting and</text><text start="306.4" dur="5.359">quadratic funding is that</text><text start="308.32" dur="5.28">in quadratic voting the uh</text><text start="311.759" dur="3.681">the number the issues that are being</text><text start="313.6" dur="3.52">voted on are still fixed and you still</text><text start="315.44" dur="2.8">need someone to choose what the issues</text><text start="317.12" dur="1.919">are</text><text start="318.24" dur="2.16">and</text><text start="319.039" dur="4.0">it turns out that there is actually a</text><text start="320.4" dur="4.799">lot of power in being the issue setter</text><text start="323.039" dur="4.72">right um just</text><text start="325.199" dur="5.361">like basically yeah like if you are a</text><text start="327.759" dur="5.521">majority that cares about something um</text><text start="330.56" dur="4.639">less and then some minority and you want</text><text start="333.28" dur="4.08">to like beat out the minority what you</text><text start="335.199" dur="4.241">can often do is you can just like raise</text><text start="337.36" dur="4.48">that the same issue in the different</text><text start="339.44" dur="4.0">forms a huge number of times and just</text><text start="341.84" dur="4.48">like basically drain the other side&apos;s</text><text start="343.44" dur="4.64">voting credits um so quadratic funding</text><text start="346.32" dur="4.719">is a bit different in that</text><text start="348.08" dur="5.52">it&apos;s kind of fully self like a complete</text><text start="351.039" dur="4.641">system and that even the choice of</text><text start="353.6" dur="4.48">questions is uh</text><text start="355.68" dur="4.239">not something that needs to be kind of</text><text start="358.08" dur="3.119">enshrined they&apos;re like pretty pre-mind</text><text start="359.919" dur="3.28">or whatever word you want to use for</text><text start="361.199" dur="4.321">that right right like</text><text start="363.199" dur="4.56">anyone can create a project anyone can</text><text start="365.52" dur="3.84">get your bto project and based on the</text><text start="367.759" dur="3.601">quadratic funding formula and based on</text><text start="369.36" dur="4.88">how many people donated and how much the</text><text start="371.36" dur="4.8">the projects get matched um so</text><text start="374.24" dur="4.959">this uh</text><text start="376.16" dur="4.8">idea that like even like what questions</text><text start="379.199" dur="4.081">people are deciding on so in this case</text><text start="380.96" dur="3.92">like which public goods to give money to</text><text start="383.28" dur="2.8">is also an emergent part of the</text><text start="384.88" dur="3.599">mechanism</text><text start="386.08" dur="3.28">is something that&apos;s really powerful um</text><text start="388.479" dur="4.0">so</text><text start="389.36" dur="5.52">gwen and i wrote the initial paper um</text><text start="392.479" dur="4.961">iem also came up with a</text><text start="394.88" dur="6.56">modified version called a pairwise</text><text start="397.44" dur="6.72">bounded quadratic funding which just uh</text><text start="401.44" dur="5.28">works a bit like is a bit more robust</text><text start="404.16" dur="4.319">against um collusion and against</text><text start="406.72" dur="3.919">attackers like</text><text start="408.479" dur="4.56">controlling a small number of accounts</text><text start="410.639" dur="5.28">um and right</text><text start="413.039" dur="4.72">i guess quadratic voting and funding</text><text start="415.919" dur="2.881">have just gone from there right of</text><text start="417.759" dur="3.761">course</text><text start="418.8" dur="4.239">well it&apos;s um i mean for me having built</text><text start="421.52" dur="4.0">git coin with the mission of growing and</text><text start="423.039" dur="5.201">sustaining open source software and</text><text start="425.52" dur="4.959">having that be a primary focus for us uh</text><text start="428.24" dur="4.959">and then launching git coin grants which</text><text start="430.479" dur="4.401">use quadratic funding as the foundation</text><text start="433.199" dur="3.521">uh it&apos;s it&apos;s amazing to hear about the</text><text start="434.88" dur="4.64">history the back history of how we got</text><text start="436.72" dur="4.879">here i&apos;m wondering uh i&apos;m wondering how</text><text start="439.52" dur="4.399">you see quadratic funding evolving from</text><text start="441.599" dur="4.401">here quadratic funding on git coin we&apos;re</text><text start="443.919" dur="3.921">using pairwise as a way of preventing</text><text start="446.0" dur="3.12">collusion on the mechanism i know that</text><text start="447.84" dur="2.88">there&apos;s other projects out there that</text><text start="449.12" dur="3.519">are doing really great stuff like clr</text><text start="450.72" dur="4.24">fund that are using macy on the</text><text start="452.639" dur="4.4">mechanism do you envision future</text><text start="454.96" dur="4.88">iteration on the mechanism or is it just</text><text start="457.039" dur="5.681">kind of down to solving civil resistance</text><text start="459.84" dur="6.0">uh or other other adjacent problems with</text><text start="462.72" dur="3.12">quadratic funding</text><text start="467.68" dur="4.639">i could see some of both um but like</text><text start="470.479" dur="4.4">what modifications there would be to the</text><text start="472.319" dur="4.32">mechanism it&apos;s uh</text><text start="474.879" dur="4.16">like i do feel like we need to keep an</text><text start="476.639" dur="3.201">open mind like i i can&apos;t think of any</text><text start="479.039" dur="3.28">that</text><text start="479.84" dur="4.72">we would apply right now except maybe</text><text start="482.319" dur="6.0">like tweaking the pair um the pairwise</text><text start="484.56" dur="6.639">matching uh coefficient and um like one</text><text start="488.319" dur="4.641">possible direction would be to</text><text start="491.199" dur="3.12">try to go further</text><text start="492.96" dur="4.639">in the</text><text start="494.319" dur="4.241">direction of um</text><text start="497.599" dur="5.521">like</text><text start="498.56" dur="4.56">trying to identify um</text><text start="503.28" dur="4.96">like which which projects have uh uh</text><text start="506.639" dur="2.96">support from the same group of people in</text><text start="508.24" dur="3.12">which projects have really diverse</text><text start="509.599" dur="3.36">support like prwise matching already</text><text start="511.36" dur="3.119">does some of that but you can you could</text><text start="512.959" dur="2.801">try to like</text><text start="514.479" dur="2.401">i guess push even harder in that</text><text start="515.76" dur="3.759">direction</text><text start="516.88" dur="3.599">um another</text><text start="519.519" dur="4.64">direction</text><text start="520.479" dur="6.561">is obviously to like</text><text start="524.159" dur="4.881">go back to exploring this question of uh</text><text start="527.04" dur="4.08">negative votes at some point</text><text start="529.04" dur="4.479">which is i mean obviously super</text><text start="531.12" dur="4.48">controversial but like on the other hand</text><text start="533.519" dur="3.201">there are i do think that there&apos;s a risk</text><text start="535.6" dur="2.96">that there are some things that will</text><text start="536.72" dur="3.76">just that like there needs to be some</text><text start="538.56" dur="5.04">kind of negative feedback responding to</text><text start="540.48" dur="5.44">right like especially if um</text><text start="543.6" dur="4.72">you know bankless dow or bitcoin or</text><text start="545.92" dur="4.8">whoever like starts really good like</text><text start="548.32" dur="4.24">getting into media like there are you</text><text start="550.72" dur="3.84">know there is such a thing as like media</text><text start="552.56" dur="4.56">that that just actually reduces the</text><text start="554.56" dur="3.36">quality of uh public discourse right um</text><text start="557.12" dur="2.96">so</text><text start="557.92" dur="3.68">yeah but that&apos;s like</text><text start="560.08" dur="3.439">the first time it was tried in round</text><text start="561.6" dur="5.12">find five you know there was a lot of uh</text><text start="563.519" dur="4.241">controversy for um obviously um and so</text><text start="566.72" dur="4.559">that&apos;s the sort of thing that would be</text><text start="567.76" dur="4.56">good to try carefully um but uh</text><text start="571.279" dur="2.401">like that</text><text start="572.32" dur="3.199">like it could even be like very</text><text start="573.68" dur="3.839">different mechanisms for doing positive</text><text start="575.519" dur="3.44">and doing negative it&apos;s possible that</text><text start="577.519" dur="3.681">anything negative would just require</text><text start="578.959" dur="3.921">much more privacy so</text><text start="581.2" dur="3.84">that&apos;s one of those</text><text start="582.88" dur="3.68">areas that probably should kind of keep</text><text start="585.04" dur="3.919">being experimented in slowly and</text><text start="586.56" dur="5.2">carefully at some point</text><text start="588.959" dur="4.56">aside from that i</text><text start="591.76" dur="3.68">would say yeah obviously civil</text><text start="593.519" dur="3.041">resistance i&apos;m obviously privacy with</text><text start="595.44" dur="3.68">mesa</text><text start="596.56" dur="5.12">um</text><text start="599.12" dur="2.56">uh it&apos;s</text><text start="602.64" dur="3.199">yeah i mean otherwise it&apos;s just a bunch</text><text start="604.16" dur="3.28">of small tweaks so like i actually think</text><text start="605.839" dur="2.881">keeping the mechanism relatively simple</text><text start="607.44" dur="2.959">and keeping the tweaks a low is the</text><text start="608.72" dur="3.76">right is the right thing to do like it</text><text start="610.399" dur="4.481">just you know it builds more confidence</text><text start="612.48" dur="5.84">that kind of sets the precedent that uh</text><text start="614.88" dur="4.399">the mechanism is what it is um</text><text start="618.32" dur="2.48">amazing</text><text start="619.279" dur="3.441">well um it&apos;s great to hear sort of that</text><text start="620.8" dur="3.52">purview from the author of the quadratic</text><text start="622.72" dur="3.6">funding paper one thing i wanted to run</text><text start="624.32" dur="3.36">by you is that we&apos;re actually having a</text><text start="626.32" dur="3.759">little bit of a hard time scaling the</text><text start="627.68" dur="4.08">pairwise mechanism at get coin right now</text><text start="630.079" dur="4.241">because we&apos;re doing hundred thousand</text><text start="631.76" dur="4.48">contributions per quarter and with</text><text start="634.32" dur="5.12">pairwise you have to pairwise bond each</text><text start="636.24" dur="4.88">contributor to each contributor</text><text start="639.44" dur="3.12">seven hundred thousand contributions how</text><text start="641.12" dur="3.6">many contributors</text><text start="642.56" dur="3.92">i think it&apos;s on the order of like</text><text start="644.72" dur="4.0">thirty thousand enough to double check</text><text start="646.48" dur="3.76">but but yeah it did scale uh</text><text start="648.72" dur="3.28">exponentially at two with the size of</text><text start="650.24" dur="3.599">the contributor set quadratically it</text><text start="652.0" dur="5.44">should be yeah yeah</text><text start="653.839" dur="5.201">so um 30 000 by 30 000 that&apos;s still 900</text><text start="657.44" dur="2.8">million like that seems like the sort of</text><text start="659.04" dur="4.239">thing that like maybe you&apos;ll have to</text><text start="660.24" dur="4.32">write it in like c instead of python um</text><text start="663.279" dur="2.721">but or</text><text start="664.56" dur="2.48">okay i&apos;ll i&apos;ll keep that in mind we&apos;ll</text><text start="666.0" dur="3.68">try and think if there are like</text><text start="667.04" dur="4.64">algorithmic tweaks um totally yeah we&apos;re</text><text start="669.68" dur="5.04">looking for i think instead of n squared</text><text start="671.68" dur="5.36">like log log n or or linear would be</text><text start="674.72" dur="4.239">great but uh yeah c plus plus or maybe</text><text start="677.04" dur="3.6">moving into a gpu in memory or something</text><text start="678.959" dur="3.44">like that is is something that we&apos;ll be</text><text start="680.64" dur="3.68">exploring an upgrade well i mean i think</text><text start="682.399" dur="3.761">uh the you know other thing is that</text><text start="684.32" dur="4.88">eventually like with macy all of this</text><text start="686.16" dur="5.119">stuff is gonna have to be snarked and so</text><text start="689.2" dur="4.319">the efficiency will kind of go back down</text><text start="691.279" dur="4.8">and so i do think that there is room for</text><text start="693.519" dur="4.56">algorithmic tweaks of some kinds but now</text><text start="696.079" dur="4.241">this is a good intellectual prompt i</text><text start="698.079" dur="3.841">will uh think about this more great</text><text start="700.32" dur="4.079">well i just found the exact number it&apos;s</text><text start="701.92" dur="4.24">27 000 contributions or</text><text start="704.399" dur="3.44">contributors in grit clean grants around</text><text start="706.16" dur="4.16">12. so</text><text start="707.839" dur="6.321">amazing okay so you have a yeah a lovely</text><text start="710.32" dur="6.319">27 000 by 27 000 matrix with 729 million</text><text start="714.16" dur="3.6">entries almost all of which are zeros</text><text start="716.639" dur="2.88">yeah</text><text start="717.76" dur="3.36">yeah recording this for a broad audience</text><text start="719.519" dur="3.361">but to the engineers on the bitcoin team</text><text start="721.12" dur="3.92">who are trying to scale that uh i&apos;m sure</text><text start="722.88" dur="4.56">they&apos;ll feel seen that we that we uh</text><text start="725.04" dur="4.56">talked about this very briefly</text><text start="727.44" dur="3.44">um we&apos;d love to would love to zoom out</text><text start="729.6" dur="2.88">and um</text><text start="730.88" dur="3.04">go from quadratic funding which is i</text><text start="732.48" dur="5.599">think where you and i have the most in</text><text start="733.92" dur="6.0">common to the entire set of areas where</text><text start="738.079" dur="4.081">where crypto</text><text start="739.92" dur="5.599">and web3 can be used for good and for</text><text start="742.16" dur="5.04">public good so i guess i want to know um</text><text start="745.519" dur="3.601">since i&apos;ve been following you vitalik</text><text start="747.2" dur="4.4">and since i&apos;ve seen your talk about</text><text start="749.12" dur="4.159">about uh crypto you&apos;ve talked a lot</text><text start="751.6" dur="3.6">about public goods i think as long as</text><text start="753.279" dur="3.281">i&apos;ve as i&apos;ve as i&apos;ve been reading your</text><text start="755.2" dur="3.199">writing so i want to know how did you</text><text start="756.56" dur="3.2">get green pilled what got you into</text><text start="758.399" dur="2.321">public goods</text><text start="759.76" dur="2.56">um</text><text start="760.72" dur="4.64">um i think uh</text><text start="762.32" dur="5.759">it was just uh looking at the crypto</text><text start="765.36" dur="4.479">space long enough and seeing</text><text start="768.079" dur="4.401">um that</text><text start="769.839" dur="6.0">like there&apos;s basically these two big uh</text><text start="772.48" dur="5.68">problems in the crypto space that where</text><text start="775.839" dur="4.161">one of them is that a lot of things that</text><text start="778.16" dur="4.239">are public goods like will really do get</text><text start="780.0" dur="4.32">underfunded and you see these crazy</text><text start="782.399" dur="3.68">imbalances where there&apos;s uh projects</text><text start="784.32" dur="3.44">that are spending hundreds of millions</text><text start="786.079" dur="3.521">or billions of dollars on security or</text><text start="787.76" dur="3.68">liquidity mining or whatever but then</text><text start="789.6" dur="4.0">like they can&apos;t uh</text><text start="791.44" dur="4.399">um grab together you know a few million</text><text start="793.6" dur="6.239">to pay for some research or development</text><text start="795.839" dur="6.161">um and then the other thing is that</text><text start="799.839" dur="4.8">when proper public goods don&apos;t get</text><text start="802.0" dur="5.92">funded what happens is that the market</text><text start="804.639" dur="5.921">comes up with uh centralized substitutes</text><text start="807.92" dur="4.719">um and you know you basically create an</text><text start="810.56" dur="4.079">ecosystem that like actually becomes</text><text start="812.639" dur="3.121">much more much more centralized than it</text><text start="814.639" dur="3.2">needs to be</text><text start="815.76" dur="3.6">um even open source software is a good</text><text start="817.839" dur="3.041">example of this right like the open</text><text start="819.36" dur="4.32">source stuff is</text><text start="820.88" dur="4.079">a public good and so it&apos;s uh</text><text start="823.68" dur="4.0">more difficult to come up with the</text><text start="824.959" dur="3.601">incentives to contribute to it but then</text><text start="827.68" dur="2.56">if</text><text start="828.56" dur="3.92">general often what happens is that</text><text start="830.24" dur="4.32">someone just creates a yes software</text><text start="832.48" dur="2.96">package that like works halfway but it&apos;s</text><text start="834.56" dur="2.48">but</text><text start="835.44" dur="3.519">it&apos;s because it&apos;s closed source and so</text><text start="837.04" dur="3.52">it has a business model to actually keep</text><text start="838.959" dur="2.481">paying developers</text><text start="840.56" dur="3.04">and</text><text start="841.44" dur="5.28">trying to come up with a yet better</text><text start="843.6" dur="4.479">solution to those problems uh was uh</text><text start="846.72" dur="3.919">definitely</text><text start="848.079" dur="3.921">something that i have been always</text><text start="850.639" dur="2.801">at least for a long time fairly</text><text start="852.0" dur="3.199">passionate about</text><text start="853.44" dur="3.839">um another way to look at this is that</text><text start="855.199" dur="3.76">i&apos;ve been like really interested in this</text><text start="857.279" dur="5.281">concept of</text><text start="858.959" dur="5.68">daos um and i guess dac well they were</text><text start="862.56" dur="3.68">called dacs before i called the daos to</text><text start="864.639" dur="3.44">be more general</text><text start="866.24" dur="3.2">decentralized autonomous corporations</text><text start="868.079" dur="4.081">organizations</text><text start="869.44" dur="4.48">and and figuring out how to actually do</text><text start="872.16" dur="3.52">a decentralized governance like what</text><text start="873.92" dur="3.919">same decentralized governance mechanisms</text><text start="875.68" dur="4.159">would look like and</text><text start="877.839" dur="3.841">it just so happens that the public</text><text start="879.839" dur="3.521">funding public goods is like one of the</text><text start="881.68" dur="3.04">most important</text><text start="883.36" dur="2.719">governance</text><text start="884.72" dur="2.64">problems or at least one of the most</text><text start="886.079" dur="2.801">important</text><text start="887.36" dur="4.0">things that any sane governance</text><text start="888.88" dur="4.079">mechanism would inevitably end up doing</text><text start="891.36" dur="3.52">and so to some extent they just end up</text><text start="892.959" dur="3.44">being the same problem so i mean it&apos;s</text><text start="894.88" dur="3.28">amazing to hear from you the example of</text><text start="896.399" dur="3.761">open source software because that&apos;s why</text><text start="898.16" dur="4.56">i founded git coin was to grow and</text><text start="900.16" dur="4.16">sustain open source software um and i</text><text start="902.72" dur="2.96">think that these the underfunding of our</text><text start="904.32" dur="3.12">digital infrastructure leads to these</text><text start="905.68" dur="3.599">systemic imbalances between people who</text><text start="907.44" dur="3.199">can create value and those who can</text><text start="909.279" dur="2.721">capture value</text><text start="910.639" dur="2.88">so i guess i&apos;m wondering you know what</text><text start="912.0" dur="3.12">do you think the endgame is for crypto</text><text start="913.519" dur="3.521">and public goods like do you think it&apos;s</text><text start="915.12" dur="3.279">possible that we&apos;ll do a better job of</text><text start="917.04" dur="3.12">funding the</text><text start="918.399" dur="3.921">underfunded public goods in the ethereum</text><text start="920.16" dur="4.479">ecosystem and what would have to be true</text><text start="922.32" dur="4.879">to expand that out to all digital public</text><text start="924.639" dur="4.241">goods or maybe all public goods in the</text><text start="927.199" dur="3.361">world using mechanisms that have been</text><text start="928.88" dur="3.759">innovated in crypto</text><text start="930.56" dur="4.719">yeah it&apos;s a good question um i do think</text><text start="932.639" dur="4.161">that like more going out further into</text><text start="935.279" dur="2.48">more and more digital public ads is</text><text start="936.8" dur="1.49">important</text><text start="937.759" dur="1.921">um</text><text start="938.29" dur="4.59">[Music]</text><text start="939.68" dur="5.68">i guess the two main challenges that</text><text start="942.88" dur="4.879">you&apos;re going to have um one of them is</text><text start="945.36" dur="4.8">like scalability i mean actually yeah i</text><text start="947.759" dur="4.401">forget it&apos;s like the new like the d</text><text start="950.16" dur="2.72">grants was that on polygon right now or</text><text start="952.16" dur="2.56">um</text><text start="952.88" dur="3.199">yeah it can be deployed to any evm</text><text start="954.72" dur="3.039">compatible network but it&apos;s on right</text><text start="956.079" dur="4.0">deploy to an even compatible right but</text><text start="957.759" dur="4.08">basically i think even though the lawyer</text><text start="960.079" dur="3.921">too is doing needs to keep getting</text><text start="961.839" dur="4.481">cheaper right and keep getting more</text><text start="964.0" dur="4.48">scalable uh before</text><text start="966.32" dur="4.8">because like the crypto space i think is</text><text start="968.48" dur="5.359">uh you know made up of uh fairly wealthy</text><text start="971.12" dur="4.959">people who are fairly comfortable paying</text><text start="973.839" dur="3.92">transaction fees that are like</text><text start="976.079" dur="2.88">quite high by most than normal people&apos;s</text><text start="977.759" dur="2.721">standards but people outside the</text><text start="978.959" dur="2.481">ecosystem are not</text><text start="980.48" dur="3.12">and</text><text start="981.44" dur="4.72">like i personally do actually believe</text><text start="983.6" dur="4.479">that like doing the macy thing and</text><text start="986.16" dur="4.4">actually sticking kind of the encrypted</text><text start="988.079" dur="4.56">record of the votes on chain is uh</text><text start="990.56" dur="3.12">something that&apos;s uh really valuable um</text><text start="992.639" dur="3.2">it really</text><text start="993.68" dur="3.44">improves the security properties of the</text><text start="995.839" dur="2.161">whole system</text><text start="997.12" dur="2.88">but</text><text start="998.0" dur="3.92">um</text><text start="1000.0" dur="4.16">if you know like it needs to actually</text><text start="1001.92" dur="4.719">just be made that be made technically</text><text start="1004.16" dur="3.52">sustainable right uh and then the other</text><text start="1006.639" dur="2.961">issue</text><text start="1007.68" dur="4.24">um</text><text start="1009.6" dur="4.4">would probably be</text><text start="1011.92" dur="4.32">um let&apos;s see well one is just that</text><text start="1014.0" dur="3.199">people outside the ethereum ecosystem</text><text start="1016.24" dur="2.64">are</text><text start="1017.199" dur="3.041">less familiar with quadratic funding and</text><text start="1018.88" dur="3.12">the other big one is</text><text start="1020.24" dur="4.319">that</text><text start="1022.0" dur="4.799">blockchains have um</text><text start="1024.559" dur="4.48">like very uh</text><text start="1026.799" dur="4.16">these very big pools of money that are</text><text start="1029.039" dur="4.081">almost like seeking for incredibly</text><text start="1030.959" dur="3.84">neutral way to deploy them right right</text><text start="1033.12" dur="2.64">like it&apos;s uh</text><text start="1034.799" dur="3.76">like for</text><text start="1035.76" dur="6.0">a big project it&apos;s a easy to come up</text><text start="1038.559" dur="5.041">with a yeah and a half a billion dollars</text><text start="1041.76" dur="3.36">and it&apos;s uh</text><text start="1043.6" dur="3.599">harder to</text><text start="1045.12" dur="4.0">come up with a mechanism first for</text><text start="1047.199" dur="3.84">figuring out how to spend it that the</text><text start="1049.12" dur="4.48">community would actually accept</text><text start="1051.039" dur="4.161">and that&apos;s not a problem that like</text><text start="1053.6" dur="3.199">that&apos;s not the problem that most people</text><text start="1055.2" dur="2.96">have right like most people don&apos;t even</text><text start="1056.799" dur="2.401">have the way of getting half a billion</text><text start="1058.16" dur="3.12">dollars</text><text start="1059.2" dur="3.359">um like</text><text start="1061.28" dur="4.399">i guess uh</text><text start="1062.559" dur="5.761">governments like um like have a look</text><text start="1065.679" dur="4.641">local taxation and all of them and um</text><text start="1068.32" dur="4.0">all of those things um</text><text start="1070.32" dur="4.239">though even there like</text><text start="1072.32" dur="4.479">you know you&apos;ll have to get pretty</text><text start="1074.559" dur="3.521">far before people are going to be</text><text start="1076.799" dur="3.201">willing to</text><text start="1078.08" dur="3.36">experiment on the same scale as i think</text><text start="1080.0" dur="3.44">even the ethereum ecosystem itself is</text><text start="1081.44" dur="3.84">willing to experiment uh but maybe it</text><text start="1083.44" dur="3.04">can happen i mean if if it does happen</text><text start="1085.28" dur="3.759">then great</text><text start="1086.48" dur="4.88">uh there and then ecosystems that like</text><text start="1089.039" dur="4.321">don&apos;t have uh either a cryptocurrency or</text><text start="1091.36" dur="4.48">a government behind them like</text><text start="1093.36" dur="2.48">some</text><text start="1096.48" dur="4.96">like a non-cryptocurrency um open source</text><text start="1099.44" dur="3.52">software package like there&apos;s this</text><text start="1101.44" dur="3.92">question of um you know where does where</text><text start="1102.96" dur="4.48">does the funding coming from and uh</text><text start="1105.36" dur="4.16">realistically you&apos;ll have like</text><text start="1107.44" dur="4.08">if that&apos;s the big problem then the way</text><text start="1109.52" dur="5.12">you&apos;ll have to end up compromising is by</text><text start="1111.52" dur="5.36">finding uh funders who uh</text><text start="1114.64" dur="4.64">or the the the most eager funders you&apos;ll</text><text start="1116.88" dur="3.919">find are funders that have um</text><text start="1119.28" dur="4.96">strong opinions about what should be</text><text start="1120.799" dur="5.281">funded and and so the quadratic</text><text start="1124.24" dur="3.04">kind of everyone contributes to deciding</text><text start="1126.08" dur="3.44">thing that like</text><text start="1127.28" dur="3.759">would not get a chance to shine as much</text><text start="1129.52" dur="3.2">um so</text><text start="1131.039" dur="3.76">though like those would be the worries</text><text start="1132.72" dur="4.4">that i predict um but</text><text start="1134.799" dur="5.201">at the same time i i do think that there</text><text start="1137.12" dur="5.36">is a lot of promise um and uh</text><text start="1140.0" dur="3.36">i so</text><text start="1142.48" dur="3.92">you know</text><text start="1143.36" dur="4.559">and strongly yeah support any efforts to</text><text start="1146.4" dur="2.96">keep expanding and ultimately like the</text><text start="1147.919" dur="3.841">only thing the only way this thing ever</text><text start="1149.36" dur="4.16">succeeds is by just like basically</text><text start="1151.76" dur="4.24">powering through the issues and like</text><text start="1153.52" dur="4.399">some of it might take one or two one or</text><text start="1156.0" dur="3.52">two more years of uh working on the</text><text start="1157.919" dur="3.601">technology or working on the memes but</text><text start="1159.52" dur="3.6">like

uh</text><text start="1188.64" dur="3.76">in the ethereum ecosystem we talk a lot</text><text start="1190.48" dur="3.52">about client diversity which is making</text><text start="1192.4"

dur="4.721">doing and uh within the quadratic</text><text start="1224.799" dur="3.36">funding</text><text start="1226.4" dur="4.88">ecosystem there&apos;s obviously git coin</text><text

dur="5.44">actually like there&apos;s two different like</text><text start="1270.24" dur="4.24">types of contexts where uh pluralism is</text><text start="1273.28" dur="3.759">important right like one of those</text><text start="1274.48" dur="4.96">contexts is where something that&apos;s too</text><text start="1277.039" dur="3.361">powerful going wrong can cause a lot of</text><text start="1279.44" dur="2.239">problems</text><text start="1280.4" dur="3.12">and</text><text start="1281.679" dur="3.441">the so the thing like the thing that</text><text start="1283.52" dur="3.44">you&apos;re risking

start="1295.76" dur="3.44">uh uh out on an opportunity to do</text><text start="1298.08" dur="2.959">something right</text><text start="1299.2" dur="3.359">right and i think uh a lot of public</text><text start="1301.039" dur="4.0">goods funding especially in the software</text><text start="1302.559" dur="3.841">space are a lot of the second right like</text><text start="1305.039" dur="2.321">it&apos;s uh</text><text start="1306.4" dur="3.68">often</text><text start="1307.36" dur="5.36">much less bad to waste uh 10 million</text><text start="1310.08" dur="5.12">dollars on

start="1316.559" dur="4.961">important and so</text><text start="1319.84" dur="4.56">like that is a yeah like a really big</text><text start="1321.52" dur="4.96">argument for for pluralism as well right</text><text start="1324.4" dur="4.08">um so i guess uh in the sec like that&apos;s</text><text start="1326.48" dur="3.679">which is exactly why like i</text><text start="1328.48" dur="3.28">support there being many different kinds</text><text start="1330.159" dur="2.721">of mechanisms right like you know you</text><text start="1331.76" dur="2.72">have</text><text

own</text><text start="1349.28" dur="7.36">coherent visions and really we we as an</text><text start="1352.72" dur="4.88">ecosystem only need like one of them to</text><text start="1356.64" dur="3.2">uh</text><text start="1357.6" dur="6.0">kind of be right um in order to get the</text><text start="1359.84" dur="6.24">important stuff covered um so</text><text start="1363.6" dur="5.12">that&apos;s um</text><text start="1366.08" dur="4.16">so that&apos;s one way or one of the kind of</text><text start="1368.72" dur="3.68">reasons why i think it&apos;s important and</text><text start="1370.24" dur="5.439">then the other thing the reason why it&apos;s</text><text start="1372.4" dur="6.32">important this lessons about um kind of</text><text start="1375.679" dur="5.12">creating the more diversity in order to</text><text start="1378.72" dur="4.959">prevent like this risk of what happens</text><text start="1380.799" dur="4.961">if uh you know what one client gets too</text><text start="1383.679" dur="3.841">powerful and that&apos;s uh obviously in the</text><text start="1385.76" dur="4.08">case of east of</text><text start="1387.52" dur="4.159">you clients uh that&apos;s uh</text><text start="1389.84" dur="3.76">a really big deal or i guess sorry</text><text start="1391.679" dur="4.0">they&apos;re consent to sawyer clients and uh</text><text start="1393.6" dur="4.079">executioner clients right i mean it&apos;s a</text><text start="1395.679" dur="3.441">big deal uh because uh</text><text start="1397.679" dur="2.961">you know if you have prison that has</text><text start="1399.12" dur="2.64">more than two-thirds and if prism is</text><text start="1400.64" dur="3.2">wrong they could just immediately</text><text start="1401.76" dur="3.12">finalize a block that&apos;s wrong and that&apos;s</text><text start="1403.84" dur="3.6">going to be really hard for the</text><text start="1404.88" dur="3.76">ecosystem to get away from</text><text start="1407.44" dur="4.96">and then</text><text start="1408.64" dur="6.8">another example of this might also be</text><text start="1412.4" dur="6.8">like political balance of power</text><text start="1415.44" dur="6.08">right because uh like if there is uh</text><text start="1419.2" dur="3.44">one very concentrated political elite</text><text start="1421.52" dur="3.12">that has a lot of power and like</text><text start="1422.64" dur="4.8">figuring out like how a protocol moves</text><text start="1424.64" dur="5.919">forward or even um or even has like a</text><text start="1427.44" dur="5.28">lot of veto power um then</text><text start="1430.559" dur="3.841">that ends up kind of really constraining</text><text start="1432.72" dur="4.24">things and constraining the protocol&apos;s</text><text start="1434.4" dur="4.639">uh ability to evolve in a different</text><text start="1436.96" dur="4.4">vision or recover from the possibility</text><text start="1439.039" dur="3.201">that that group of people is wrong</text><text start="1441.36" dur="2.64">so</text><text start="1442.24" dur="5.52">yeah so both of the yeah both of those</text><text start="1444.0" dur="5.12">are just like really important to um</text><text start="1447.76" dur="3.84">keep in mind and</text><text start="1449.12" dur="3.919">uh and really important to foster so you</text><text start="1451.6" dur="3.439">know i&apos;m happy that we have all of these</text><text start="1453.039" dur="4.321">these two clients and that there&apos;s just</text><text start="1455.039" dur="4.561">big movements to try to get like people</text><text start="1457.36" dur="4.0">and not just people also applications</text><text start="1459.6" dur="3.52">like things like dapnode that a lot of</text><text start="1461.36" dur="3.919">seekers to rely on it too i support all</text><text start="1463.12" dur="4.0">of them right um</text><text start="1465.279" dur="3.601">and then</text><text start="1467.12" dur="3.6">obviously the uh</text><text start="1468.88" dur="4.799">more distributed public goods funding</text><text start="1470.72" dur="4.959">efforts i i feel like they have improved</text><text start="1473.679" dur="3.921">things in the ethereum space quite a bit</text><text start="1475.679" dur="3.841">already right like even you know</text><text start="1477.6" dur="4.16">bankless was a</text><text start="1479.52" dur="5.92">major early recipient of uh git coin</text><text start="1481.76" dur="5.919">grants right funding yeah so</text><text start="1485.44" dur="5.359">you know we need both we need uh a lot</text><text start="1487.679" dur="4.961">of this public pluralism right</text><text start="1490.799" dur="5.201">amazing yeah i&apos;m wondering other than</text><text start="1492.64" dur="5.279">the mechanisms that i mentioned uh which</text><text start="1496.0" dur="3.84">just to refresh the audience&apos;s memory</text><text start="1497.919" dur="3.841">were retroactive public goods funding</text><text start="1499.84" dur="4.64">coordinate clr fund bitcoin grants</text><text start="1501.76" dur="4.96">quadratic funding what other mechanisms</text><text start="1504.48" dur="4.319">are you excited about and do you think</text><text start="1506.72" dur="4.72">are underexplored for funding public</text><text start="1508.799" dur="5.201">goods if any one of the</text><text start="1511.44" dur="5.28">ideas for public goods funding that does</text><text start="1514.0" dur="4.64">not depend on a central funds allocator</text><text start="1516.72" dur="4.079">that i&apos;ve tried to push on a couple of</text><text start="1518.64" dur="5.12">occasions it was like actually doing a</text><text start="1520.799" dur="4.48">better job of having like using nfts to</text><text start="1523.76" dur="3.68">fund public goods</text><text start="1525.279" dur="4.481">um</text><text start="1527.44" dur="4.239">yeah like we yeah like so far it feels</text><text start="1529.76" dur="5.76">like um you know we have these really</text><text start="1531.679" dur="6.321">expensive uh nfts that uh often support</text><text start="1535.52" dur="4.56">things that like are often actually</text><text start="1538.0" dur="4.24">interesting and fun uh but it would be</text><text start="1540.08" dur="3.44">cool if we have the get of teens that</text><text start="1542.24" dur="3.12">support things that are interesting and</text><text start="1543.52" dur="4.0">fun but also meaningful</text><text start="1545.36" dur="4.799">um</text><text start="1547.52" dur="4.8">there is uh</text><text start="1550.159" dur="3.52">i think they&apos;re like they&apos;re the model</text><text start="1552.32" dur="2.64">that i had</text><text start="1553.679" dur="2.641">supported</text><text start="1554.96" dur="3.12">back when i wrote that post on</text><text start="1556.32" dur="4.0">legitimacy a while back right was this</text><text start="1558.08" dur="5.599">idea that you could have nfts that were</text><text start="1560.32" dur="4.88">kind of a ah an artist partnering with a</text><text start="1563.679" dur="3.36">charity where the artist kind of</text><text start="1565.2" dur="5.359">provides the art to the charity and</text><text

start="1574.48" dur="3.84">you know the nft becomes kind of both</text><text start="1576.24" dur="5.039">art and a way to like show that you care</text><text start="1578.32" dur="4.8">about a

dur="5.52">crypto punks for optimism i saw that</text><text start="1587.76" dur="5.44">they were spent like putting some of the</text><text start="1590.72" dur="3.439">revenues from selling the punks into the</text><text start="1593.2" dur="2.88">yeah</text><text start="1594.159" dur="3.841">the retro funding pool or something like</text><text start="1596.08" dur="3.599">that yep that&apos;s right they did they did</text><text start="1598.0" dur="3.039">fund around and we&apos;re very thankful for</text><text start="1599.679" dur="2.641">that um and we&apos;ve also been</text><text

start="1627.279" dur="2.241">hear</text><text start="1630.08" dur="3.52">great well yeah we&apos;re always um you know</text><text start="1632.159" dur="3.441">i say that quadratic funding is just</text><text start="1633.6" dur="3.52">this really amazing elegant mechanism</text><text start="1635.6" dur="3.52">but the two kind of</text><text start="1637.12" dur="4.08">catches that come along with it are</text><text start="1639.12" dur="6.0">solving the civil inclusion problem</text><text start="1641.2" dur="6.4">which is somewhat complex and then also</text><text start="1645.12" dur="4.32">the continual need to fund a matching</text><text start="1647.6" dur="3.36">pool are just like the two kind of like</text><text start="1649.44" dur="3.28">adjacent things that you need to do in</text><text start="1650.96" dur="4.719">order to keep that steam engine of</text><text start="1652.72" dur="4.64">quadratic funding rolling and um you&apos;ve</text><text start="1655.679" dur="3.761">traditionally been sort of an advocate</text><text start="1657.36" dur="3.52">for let&apos;s not choose spend too much</text><text start="1659.44" dur="3.04">money in each</text><text

quadratic funding that&apos;s</text><text start="1666.72" dur="4.64">going to happen over time so that they</text><text start="1669.039" dur="4.081">can start to expect it and adjust their</text><text

those two mechanisms those</text><text start="1677.44" dur="2.88">two sort of like</text><text start="1678.799" dur="4.24">catch is right with quadratic funding</text><text start="1680.32" dur="4.079">it&apos;s the ability to innovate on how you</text><text start="1683.039" dur="3.201">fund the matching pool and the ability</text><text start="1684.399" dur="3.601">to innovate on on fraud detection is</text><text start="1686.24" dur="3.6">there anything else uh that you would</text><text start="1688.0" dur="3.76">include in that category of of like</text><text start="1689.84" dur="4.959">quadratic funding adjacent uh</text><text start="1691.76" dur="3.039">implementation problems</text><text start="1697.12" dur="5.36">those are probably the big ones right um</text><text start="1700.32" dur="4.64">yeah like there&apos;s uh</text><text start="1702.48" dur="4.64">the kind of making sure the mech what</text><text start="1704.96" dur="6.24">category one is uh making sure the</text><text start="1707.12" dur="4.08">mechanism is sounds which would include</text><text start="1712.0" dur="4.0">like the</text><text start="1713.919" dur="3.281">cryptography all of that

dur="4.561">solved with um like proof of personhood</text><text start="1802.96" dur="2.719">that might require some other solutions</text><text start="1804.72" dur="3.28">like i&apos;m</text><text

um</text><text start="1828.799" dur="5.36">so i think uh like having airdrops that</text><text start="1831.36" dur="6.24">are gated by proof of personhood is uh</text><text start="1834.159" dur="5.52">something that could really uh help and</text><text start="1837.6" dur="4.079">uh improve things and like it could even</text><text start="1839.679" dur="3.681">be a hybrid right it could

think</text><text start="2058.159" dur="4.96">quadratic funding might need to evolve</text><text start="2060.159" dur="4.801">eventually is that right now</text><text start="2063.119" dur="4.56">the

dur="5.76">uh someone from the arbitrary community</text><text start="2098.56" dur="4.4">and one way to look at this is um like</text><text start="2101.839" dur="2.881">well</text><text start="2102.96" dur="4.72">well that like the point is that the</text><text start="2104.72" dur="5.119">mechanism is flat because like it&apos;s by</text><text start="2107.68" dur="4.56">being willing to don&apos;t to kind of throw</text><text start="2109.839" dur="4.0">money into um the</text><text start="2112.24" dur="2.879">system as a contributor that you are</text><text start="2113.839"

uh</text><text start="2118.96" dur="6.48">looking about the um at this though is</text><text start="2122.32" dur="3.12">that um</text><text start="2126.8" dur="5.44">like in practice and um you know</text><text start="2129.76" dur="5.44">especially with uh some uh some of these</text><text start="2132.24" dur="6.0">per person limits it is like it might be</text><text start="2135.2" dur="5.52">it is possible that some of these uh</text><text start="2138.24" dur="5.04">uh projects end up being vulnerable to</text><text start="2140.72" dur="4.32">brigading um and</text><text start="2143.28" dur="5.04">it&apos;s like and this is a problem</text><text start="2145.04" dur="4.88">especially if like you have funders that</text><text start="2148.32" dur="3.6">like actually actually care right</text><text start="2149.92" dur="4.24">because uh like quadratic funding the</text><text start="2151.92" dur="3.919">mechanism was originally designed as</text><text start="2154.16" dur="3.52">this kind of very neutral mechanism just</text><text start="2155.839" dur="2.641">as fun to all funds me all the public</text><text start="2157.68" dur="1.679">goods</text><text start="2158.48" dur="2.48">and so</text><text start="2159.359" dur="4.321">you know from that light like it makes</text><text start="2160.96" dur="4.72">sense why are you um</text><text start="2163.68" dur="3.6">why yeah you know you want to try to be</text><text start="2165.68" dur="3.28">completely unusual between everything</text><text start="2167.28" dur="3.44">but when you have like sources of</text><text start="2168.96" dur="4.08">funding that wants to be more specific</text><text start="2170.72" dur="3.52">then does it make sense to find a way to</text><text start="2173.04" dur="4.16">try to</text><text start="2174.24" dur="4.72">make the mechanism be more be more um</text><text start="2177.2" dur="3.2">more specific like what would that what</text><text start="2178.96" dur="2.56">would that actually take like what would</text><text start="2180.4" dur="3.52">happen if</text><text start="2181.52" dur="6.16">um you know an optimism person um tries</text><text start="2183.92" dur="6.0">to like um make it uh or let&apos;s say any</text><text start="2187.68" dur="5.12">world where uh bitcoin agreements is</text><text start="2189.92" dur="7.6">fully automated um and then someone an</text><text start="2192.8" dur="6.559">optimism person um submits a uh</text><text start="2197.52" dur="3.92">a project um</text><text start="2199.359" dur="4.641">applying for funding from the arbor</text><text start="2201.44" dur="5.36">trump wall where that project actually</text><text start="2204.0" dur="4.24">just uh send uh uh sends the money

dur="2.721">and then they just invite a whole bunch</text><text start="2211.119" dur="3.681">of optimism people to like throw a</text><text start="2212.56" dur="4.88">dollar in and get some and get some of</text><text start="2214.8" dur="6.0">the arbitrary matching funds like</text><text start="2217.44" dur="5.36">how would you actually uh</text><text start="2220.8" dur="4.48">prevent that like would it actually</text><text start="2222.8" dur="5.6">would it be some kind of like gated</text><text start="2225.28" dur="5.68">participation um thing where if you&apos;re</text><text start="2228.4" dur="4.24">not like one of the community members</text><text start="2230.96" dur="3.84">then either you have like us a smaller</text><text start="2232.64" dur="4.4">matching allocation or just uh</text><text start="2234.8" dur="5.2">or you just don&apos;t get matched um would</text><text start="2237.04" dur="4.559">it be something else</text><text start="2240.0" dur="4.0">would the</text><text start="2241.599" dur="3.76">matching pool be able to like specify</text><text start="2244.0" dur="4.64">some group participants that have free</text><text start="2245.359" dur="4.641">credits like i don&apos;t know but uh</text><text start="2248.64" dur="3.36">that&apos;s just like one of the things that</text><text start="2250.0" dur="3.92">would be yeah interesting to look at</text><text start="2252.0" dur="4.72">eventually right like this uh</text><text start="2253.92" dur="5.04">i think uh gets into the broader uh this</text><text start="2256.72" dur="3.92">question of like we talked how we talk</text><text start="2258.96" dur="3.44">about there&apos;s this binary of private and</text><text start="2260.64" dur="3.52">public goods but right the reality is</text><text start="2262.4" dur="4.24">that nothing is fully private or fully</text><text start="2264.16" dur="4.72">public like there&apos;s medium scale public</text><text start="2266.64" dur="4.0">goods that that benefits some people but</text><text start="2268.88" dur="2.88">they&apos;ll benefit other people and then</text><text start="2270.64" dur="2.8">there&apos;s</text><text start="2271.76" dur="3.2">people in there and sources of funding</text><text start="2273.44" dur="3.36">that care about some ecosystem events</text><text start="2274.96" dur="3.6">and not our other

dur="3.68">it&apos;s uh going to be an interesting</text><text start="2282.16" dur="3.6">challenge but you know i think it&apos;s also</text><text start="2284.0" dur="3.119">a really important one right well yeah i</text><text start="2285.76" dur="3.44">think that&apos;s a really important one as</text><text start="2287.119" dur="3.521">get coin grants has uh</text><text start="2289.2" dur="3.28">we&apos;ve we&apos;ve been scaling vertically</text><text start="2290.64" dur="3.199">which means bigger matching pools but</text><text start="2292.48" dur="3.04">now we&apos;re starting to

on yeah i just</text><text start="2328.56" dur="3.279">wanted to talk on the the sort of like</text><text start="2330.079" dur="2.721">binary between public and private goods</text><text start="2331.839" dur="2.401">and one of the things that i&apos;ve been</text><text start="2332.8" dur="4.319">struggling with from a governance</text><text start="2334.24" dur="4.48">perspective is that um a lot of these</text><text start="2337.119" dur="3.201">projects that are on get coin are public</text><text start="2338.72" dur="3.68">goods in some way or private goods in</text><text start="2340.32" dur="4.72">another way and i look at these things</text><text start="2342.4" dur="4.32">as maybe a double-sided or triple-sided</text><text start="2345.04" dur="4.0">marketplace in which one side of the</text><text start="2346.72" dur="4.8">marketplace is a public good and the</text><text start="2349.04" dur="4.0">other side of the marketplace is a</text><text start="2351.52" dur="3.68">private good something that you have to</text><text start="2353.04" dur="4.0">pay for and you know like the example</text><text start="2355.2" dur="3.84">that i would that i would sort of use is</text><text start="2357.04" dur="4.16">um you know i think like ens the ability</text><text start="2359.04" dur="3.28">to find anyone</text><text start="2361.2" dur="2.48">out there</text><text start="2362.32" dur="3.759">and like figure out what their ether</text><text start="2363.68" dur="5.439">address is based off of a name that you</text><text start="2366.079" dur="4.641">can remember like i&apos;m milwaukee.eth and</text><text start="2369.119" dur="4.801">being able to find me that is a public</text><text start="2370.72" dur="6.32">good but the ability to write to the ens</text><text start="2373.92" dur="5.6">system costs eth and so on that side of</text><text start="2377.04" dur="4.64">the market it&apos;s it&apos;s like gated by</text><text start="2379.52" dur="4.319">some amount of of money it&apos;s it is</text><text start="2381.68" dur="3.439">excludable and it is rivalrous and so</text><text start="2383.839" dur="3.921">i&apos;m wondering you know how do you think</text><text start="2385.119" dur="5.121">about that spectrum of pure public goods</text><text start="2387.76" dur="4.88">and private goods and is there capacity</text><text start="2390.24" dur="4.96">for nuance in how we fund these public</text><text start="2392.64" dur="4.16">goods and um you know how do you think</text><text start="2395.2" dur="3.68">about that is it a binary or is it a</text><text start="2396.8" dur="5.92">spectrum to you</text><text start="2398.88" dur="3.84">um it&apos;s definitely a spectrum to me</text><text start="2402.88" dur="2.479">okay um</text><text start="2404.56" dur="3.759">yeah</text><text start="2405.359" dur="5.201">i know i think it&apos;s uh again</text><text start="2408.319" dur="4.961">it&apos;s definitely a spectrum um i think</text><text start="2410.56" dur="4.559">it&apos;s not showing itself as a spectrum</text><text start="2413.28" dur="3.68">yet um and the reason why it&apos;s not</text><text start="2415.119" dur="5.041">showing itself as a spectrum yet is</text><text start="2416.96" dur="4.32">because uh like the amount of funding to</text><text start="2420.16" dur="3.12">that&apos;s uh</text><text start="2421.28" dur="4.079">there for public goods it&apos;s still like</text><text start="2423.28" dur="3.76">nowhere near as high as it should be and</text><text start="2425.359" dur="3.281">so when the funding is scarce like it</text><text start="2427.04" dur="3.68">just gets distributed to the things that</text><text start="2428.64" dur="4.08">really really need it the most which are</text><text start="2430.72" dur="3.76">these uh very pure and very uh</text><text start="2432.72" dur="3.04">underfunded uh public goods that just</text><text start="2434.48" dur="3.119">have no chance of having a business</text><text start="2435.76" dur="3.04">model otherwise</text><text start="2437.599" dur="3.681">but</text><text start="2438.8" dur="4.24">as the funding increases and as the</text><text start="2441.28" dur="4.0">ecosystem saturates a little more like i</text><text start="2443.04" dur="4.96">think it fully makes sense for public</text><text start="2445.28" dur="5.68">goods funding mechanisms to also like</text><text start="2448.0" dur="4.8">intervene in uh places where there are</text><text start="2450.96" dur="4.08">kind of mixed public and private</text><text start="2452.8" dur="4.559">concerns um right</text><text start="2455.04" dur="4.559">like uh eventually if uh you know you</text><text start="2457.359" dur="4.561">know if like an entire government of</text><text start="2459.599" dur="5.201">like starts uh running on on quadratic</text><text start="2461.92" dur="5.04">funding then um you know maybe like yes</text><text start="2464.8" dur="4.319">it should just like give subsidies to</text><text start="2466.96" dur="3.68">businesses who take more effort than</text><text start="2469.119" dur="4.24">others to make sure that their products</text><text start="2470.64" dur="4.16">are environmentally friendly um or um</text><text start="2473.359" dur="3.601">you know to like health insurance</text><text start="2474.8" dur="3.76">companies that like do more to and to</text><text start="2476.96" dur="4.399">ensure that their offerings that are</text><text start="2478.56" dur="4.0">fully universal and open to everyone um</text><text start="2481.359" dur="2.161">like</text><text start="2482.56" dur="2.0">that&apos;s</text><text start="2483.52" dur="2.72">you know like they&apos;re again the real</text><text start="2484.56" dur="3.68">world there are a lot of like mixed</text><text start="2486.24" dur="3.92">private and public goods um like that</text><text start="2488.24" dur="4.32">and i think you know that&apos;s you know</text><text start="2490.16" dur="4.4">definitely part of the complexity of the</text><text start="2492.56" dur="5.2">of the world that we&apos;re trying to build</text><text start="2494.56" dur="4.88">for which is which is totally fine</text><text start="2497.76" dur="4.559">so what i heard there is maybe a crypto</text><text start="2499.44" dur="4.96">economic incentive for things that you</text><text start="2502.319" dur="4.321">the businesses may have externalized</text><text start="2504.4" dur="4.08">things like environmental impact or</text><text start="2506.64" dur="3.199">access to health care to people who are</text><text start="2508.48" dur="2.24">not profitable</text><text start="2509.839" dur="3.121">um</text><text start="2510.72" dur="4.48">adding uh adding a crypto economic</text><text start="2512.96" dur="4.8">incentive to not externalize those</text><text start="2515.2" dur="4.48">things and to bear those costs and using</text><text start="2517.76" dur="3.44">quadratic funding mechanism as a way of</text><text start="2519.68" dur="3.439">creating that incentive did i hear that</text><text start="2521.2" dur="4.0">that correctly</text><text start="2523.119" dur="3.121">exactly okay yeah one of the things that</text><text start="2525.2" dur="2.72">we&apos;ve been talking about in the</text><text start="2526.24" dur="3.76">regenerative crypto economic space is</text><text start="2527.92" dur="4.56">sort of defining an impact out as</text><text start="2530.0" dur="4.72">anything that has a net positive impact</text><text start="2532.48" dur="5.28">on the world um whether that&apos;s a</text><text start="2534.72" dur="4.639">financial social or other type of impact</text><text start="2537.76" dur="4.48">on the world and i&apos;m wondering what you</text><text start="2539.359" dur="4.401">think of that of that definition of like</text><text start="2542.24" dur="2.96">building we&apos;re i&apos;m trying what i&apos;m</text><text start="2543.76" dur="4.0">searching for is an atomic building</text><text start="2545.2" dur="5.119">block of regenerative crypto economics</text><text start="2547.76" dur="3.92">and the best i&apos;ve come up on is is one</text><text start="2550.319" dur="3.601">that has a</text><text start="2551.68" dur="5.52">net uh positive impact and externalize</text><text start="2553.92" dur="5.12">is good for for the world um it what do</text><text start="2557.2" dur="3.919">you think about that definition and and</text><text start="2559.04" dur="4.559">can we build a composable building block</text><text start="2561.119" dur="4.0">for more regenerative uh</text><text start="2563.599" dur="3.841">systems</text><text start="2565.119" dur="4.321">and how would you define it if not</text><text start="2567.44" dur="3.52">uh can we build a</text><text start="2569.44" dur="2.56">building block from our generative</text><text start="2570.96" dur="2.72">systems</text><text start="2572.0" dur="3.28">i feel like there&apos;s lots of building</text><text start="2573.68" dur="3.04">blocks for more regenerative systems</text><text start="2575.28" dur="2.319">like this is the sort of thing that&apos;s</text><text start="2576.72" dur="2.72">like</text><text start="2577.599" dur="3.121">difficult to reduce the one component</text><text start="2579.44" dur="3.04">right because there&apos;s public goods</text><text start="2580.72" dur="3.28">funding and there&apos;s different kinds of</text><text start="2582.48" dur="3.359">public goods funding and even different</text><text start="2584.0" dur="4.16">dependencies to public goods funding</text><text start="2585.839" dur="5.201">like we talked about like identity yeah</text><text start="2588.16" dur="4.88">some of the cryptographic aspects um</text><text start="2591.04" dur="3.52">there is like decentralized governance</text><text start="2593.04" dur="2.799">there&apos;s this there&apos;s like some kind of</text><text start="2594.56" dur="3.44">arbitration</text><text start="2595.839" dur="4.561">um and all of these systems kind of</text><text start="2598.0" dur="4.64">depend on each other in complicated ways</text><text start="2600.4" dur="5.199">um</text><text start="2602.64" dur="4.719">yeah i know so yeah i think there&apos;s a</text><text start="2605.599" dur="4.24">probably like at least half a dozen</text><text start="2607.359" dur="4.321">building blocks if uh if not more that</text><text start="2609.839" dur="3.76">like if we were to try to draw out a</text><text start="2611.68" dur="3.36">diagram of all of this like we would see</text><text start="2613.599" dur="3.601">them right yeah i was kind of looking</text><text start="2615.04" dur="4.079">for the lowest common denominator like</text><text start="2617.2" dur="3.84">for example with erc20 you can have a</text><text start="2619.119" dur="4.321">token that&apos;s a governance token that&apos;s a</text><text start="2621.04" dur="4.799">utility token that&apos;s a security and</text><text start="2623.44" dur="3.6">erc20 is the lowest common denominator</text><text start="2625.839" dur="3.841">and my attempt at a lowest common</text><text start="2627.04" dur="3.92">denominator for this stuff is impact al</text><text start="2629.68" dur="2.72">is something that has a positive</text><text start="2630.96" dur="3.52">externality and that could be</text><text start="2632.4" dur="4.88">implemented yeah i think that&apos;s uh yeah</text><text start="2634.48" dur="4.96">i think that&apos;s uh so probably the close</text><text start="2637.28" dur="5.28">closest uh you can get it&apos;s a good place</text><text start="2639.44" dur="4.96">to be right yeah i support impact house</text><text start="2642.56" dur="3.12">cool uh well vitalik thank you so much</text><text start="2644.4" dur="3.12">for coming on the regenerative crypto</text><text start="2645.68" dur="4.24">economics show and looking forward to</text><text start="2647.52" dur="5.04">seeing you at eath denver and through</text><text start="2649.92" dur="5.88">2022. thanks so much vitalik</text><text start="2652.56" dur="3.24">thank you</text><text start="2656.72" dur="9.84">[Music]</text><text start="2664.48"
