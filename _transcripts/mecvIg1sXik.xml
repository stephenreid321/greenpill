dur="4.981">networkologies a philosophy of networks</text><text start="24.06" dur="4.2">for a hyper-connected age and we talk</text><text start="26.76" dur="3.06">about the questions of where networks</text><text start="28.26" dur="4.319">come from how they change and develop</text><text start="29.82" dur="5.46">what conditions may lead to their and</text><text start="32.579" dur="4.441">our continued flourishing and we talk</text><text start="35.28" dur="4.799">about why this is such an important</text><text start="37.02" dur="4.5">topic for the 21st century endows the</text><text start="40.079" dur="3.0">network is increasingly one of the</text><text start="41.52" dur="3.24">fundamental metaphors that have</text><text start="43.079" dur="3.3">described the

start="48.059" dur="4.201">that is connected through a network of</text><text start="49.379" dur="4.921">computers and so this is a network that</text><text start="52.26" dur="4.619">you&apos;re using to listen to a podcast</text><text start="54.3" dur="3.96">about networkologies and I just think</text><text start="56.879" dur="3.901">that it&apos;s it&apos;s beautiful the way</text><text start="58.26" dur="5.34">Christopher can use this network lens to</text><text start="60.78" dur="5.699">talk about why networks are so important</text><text start="63.6" dur="5.22">and how to dissect biological systems as</text><text start="66.479" dur="4.5">networks economic systems as networks</text><text start="68.82" dur="4.2">and you start to see networks everywhere</text><text start="70.979" dur="3.601">around you after talking to Christopher</text><text start="73.02" dur="3.3">for an hour it&apos;s that scene in The</text><text start="74.58" dur="3.0">Matrix where I think Neo sees code all</text><text start="76.32" dur="3.18">around them I&apos;m seeing networks all</text><text start="77.58" dur="5.219">around myself after talking to</text><text start="79.5" dur="4.86">Christopher for uh an hour or so and so</text><text start="82.799" dur="3.541">uh we turned the conversation in the</text><text start="84.36" dur="4.5">second half of the episode to hear</text><text start="86.34" dur="4.5">Christopher&apos;s thoughts about Dows and</text><text start="88.86" dur="3.66">the ethereum network what would it look</text><text start="90.84" dur="4.22">like if we could program our values into</text><text start="92.52" dur="5.88">our money and we could build a</text><text start="95.06" dur="6.64">decentralized highly relational network</text><text start="98.4" dur="5.579">of local currencies and of dows that</text><text start="101.7" dur="4.98">help create human thriving I mean this</text><text start="103.979" dur="4.68">is to land it in green pill terms is how</text><text start="106.68" dur="3.84">do we use networks of programmable money</text><text start="108.659" dur="4.5">and networks of humans to create change</text><text start="110.52" dur="4.44">of self and change of system in order to</text><text start="113.159" dur="3.841">create human thriving to regenerate the</text><text start="114.96" dur="4.86">world and so it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of an</text><text start="117.0" dur="5.04">interesting meeting of networkologies in</text><text start="119.82" dur="3.839">greenpill for this episode for me and I</text><text start="122.04" dur="3.539">just learned a lot from talking to</text><text start="123.659" dur="3.181">Christopher I think he&apos;s very very lucid</text><text start="125.579" dur="3.6">and complements the green pill</text><text start="126.84" dur="4.619">methodology a lot there are a few</text><text start="129.179" dur="4.261">episodes where I will go way far outside</text><text start="131.459" dur="4.261">of the web 3 space in order to bring a</text><text start="133.44" dur="4.68">guest in and and give them a little</text><text start="135.72" dur="3.78">green pill and to to bring them to you</text><text start="138.12" dur="3.06">and Christopher is one of those people</text><text start="139.5" dur="4.56">actually read Network allergies because</text><text start="141.18" dur="4.919">Vince horn one of my friends in the web</text><text start="144.06" dur="3.96">3 ecosystem recommended it to me and</text><text start="146.099" dur="3.601">it&apos;s just it&apos;s just mind-blowing stuff I</text><text start="148.02" dur="3.48">mean looking at the lens of networks</text><text start="149.7" dur="3.24">across everything in the world is so</text><text start="151.5"

this</text><text start="309.06" dur="4.199">conversation when I read networkologies</text><text start="310.74" dur="4.56">it was just neurons firing everywhere</text><text start="313.259" dur="4.681">and so finally got you to come on green</text><text start="315.3" dur="5.04">pill and and talk about the book Network</text><text start="317.94" dur="4.08">ologies and philosophy for of networks</text><text start="320.34" dur="3.12">for a hyper-connected age so can you</text><text start="322.02" dur="2.399">tell me what inspired you to write this</text><text start="323.46" dur="3.36">book</text><text start="324.419" dur="4.021">sure uh you know I guess when I I first</text><text start="326.82" dur="4.379">learned about how artificial neural</text><text start="328.44" dur="5.699">networks work uh and Notions like back</text><text start="331.199" dur="4.381">propagation and you know sort of the</text><text start="334.139" dur="3.12">honen networks and you know the</text><text start="335.58" dur="4.32">self-assorting feature maps all the</text><text start="337.259" dur="4.561">stuff that&apos;s making the new AI do what</text><text start="339.9" dur="3.18">it does uh you know especially when</text><text start="341.82" dur="4.02">we&apos;re talking about stuff like facial</text><text start="343.08" dur="4.559">recognition it sort of felt like the</text><text start="345.84" dur="5.04">stuff I was trying to do with philosophy</text><text start="347.639" dur="6.12">had found a concrete manifestation uh</text><text start="350.88" dur="4.56">you know where uh we now have sort of an</text><text start="353.759" dur="5.341">understanding at least in a sort of</text><text start="355.44" dur="5.22">digital diagrammatic form of what neural</text><text start="359.1" dur="3.42">processes might be like that could</text><text start="360.66" dur="5.4">produce something similar to human</text><text start="362.52" dur="6.72">cognition uh that was organic that was</text><text start="366.06" dur="4.62">you know sort of inspired by uh living</text><text start="369.24" dur="3.36">forms</text><text start="370.68" dur="4.079">um and that was distributed and</text><text start="372.6" dur="4.52">metastable in ways that really could</text><text start="374.759" dur="5.521">sync up with complex system science</text><text start="377.12" dur="6.1">so I wanted to sort of take these sort</text><text start="380.28" dur="5.4">of relational leanings in philosophy and</text><text start="383.22" dur="4.08">the science of emergence uh you know in</text><text start="385.68" dur="4.2">terms of say complex system signs stuff</text><text start="387.3" dur="4.14">like that and tied into developments and</text><text start="389.88" dur="3.84">Neuroscience and artificial intelligence</text><text start="391.44" dur="4.14">in ways that could</text><text start="393.72" dur="3.24">um you know do what I think philosophy</text><text start="395.58" dur="3.899">does best</text><text start="396.96" dur="4.2">um which is try to talk about big</text><text start="399.479" dur="3.78">picture stuff</text><text start="401.16" dur="3.539">um you know like generalize you know you</text><text start="403.259" dur="4.621">have things from science you have things</text><text start="404.699" dur="6.06">from technology but trying to find ways</text><text start="407.88" dur="5.46">to uh develop linkages to culture and</text><text start="410.759" dur="5.401">history and value and stuff</text><text start="413.34" dur="4.68">yeah I I know that we started talking a</text><text start="416.16" dur="3.599">little bit about artificial intelligence</text><text start="418.02" dur="3.119">and neural networks there for a little</text><text start="419.759" dur="3.241">bit but one of the things that I think</text><text start="421.139" dur="3.721">was a really interesting frame at the</text><text start="423.0" dur="3.6">start of the book was talking about how</text><text start="424.86" dur="3.179">the network is increasingly one of the</text><text start="426.6" dur="3.18">fundamental metaphors that have</text><text start="428.039" dur="2.94">described the character of our age and I</text><text start="429.78" dur="3.0">think that that was a reference to the</text><text start="430.979" dur="4.201">internet but you actually talk further</text><text start="432.78" dur="4.56">about neural networks in the brain and</text><text start="435.18" dur="5.579">how a chair could be a network of of</text><text start="437.34" dur="5.28">atoms that compose it and so you maybe</text><text start="440.759" dur="3.72">AI is sort of the tip of the spear for</text><text start="442.62" dur="3.479">you but looking at everything around you</text><text start="444.479" dur="3.72">as a network of interconnected things</text><text start="446.099" dur="4.38">that are defined by their relationship</text><text start="448.199" dur="5.161">to each other is that a fair broadening</text><text start="450.479" dur="5.101">of the scope oh yeah absolutely uh I</text><text start="453.36" dur="4.32">mean I think relational World Views are</text><text start="455.58" dur="5.04">as old as philosophical thinking and</text><text start="457.68" dur="4.799">they tend to be the norm uh in many</text><text start="460.62" dur="4.139">Traditions around the world other than</text><text start="462.479" dur="3.901">that of you know what tends to be called</text><text start="464.759" dur="4.801">the West you know the say the European</text><text start="466.38" dur="5.58">Greco Euro kind of thing</text><text start="469.56" dur="4.139">um but yeah relational thinking is old</text><text start="471.96" dur="3.78">and you know you could clearly really</text><text start="473.699" dur="3.84">argue that</text><text start="475.74" dur="2.88">um networks aren&apos;t as new as we might</text><text start="477.539" dur="3.66">think</text><text start="478.62" dur="5.46">um you know cells or networks uh you</text><text start="481.199" dur="5.4">know atoms and molecules or networks and</text><text start="484.08" dur="4.14">so I think maybe we just are able to see</text><text start="486.599" dur="3.54">some of these things now that we have</text><text start="488.22" dur="4.919">the sort of lenses that have been</text><text start="490.139" dur="4.741">provided by this new networked age uh so</text><text start="493.139" dur="3.481">people you know are no longer looking at</text><text start="494.88" dur="3.8">the world and you know cells and things</text><text start="496.62" dur="4.799">of that sort as like you know just</text><text start="498.68" dur="4.239">serial you know linkages of you know</text><text start="501.419" dur="3.661">binary switches they&apos;re they&apos;re looking</text><text start="502.919" dur="4.261">at it more on the model of networks that</text><text start="505.08" dur="3.899">grow organically like the internet or</text><text start="507.18" dur="4.859">you know like the way in which we learn</text><text start="508.979" dur="4.8">things in a brain so yeah</text><text start="512.039" dur="3.961">yeah looking at the they got the book</text><text start="513.779" dur="3.721">right in front of me and and it goes</text><text start="516.0" dur="3.899">through at the start uh the following</text><text start="517.5" dur="5.779">network network illogical principles so</text><text start="519.899" dur="5.521">relation process holography practice</text><text start="523.279" dur="4.421">practicality intermediation and</text><text start="525.42" dur="3.419">emergence are the the principles of the</text><text start="527.7" dur="2.46">networks I don&apos;t know if you have</text><text start="528.839" dur="2.641">anything to say about those but I I</text><text start="530.16" dur="4.02">thought it was neat to sort of break it</text><text start="531.48" dur="4.799">down to the first order principles there</text><text start="534.18" dur="4.44">yeah no I mean everything I&apos;m doing</text><text start="536.279" dur="4.921">tries to take the structure of networks</text><text start="538.62" dur="4.44">as sort of a model and you know make</text><text start="541.2" dur="4.74">that resonate with a wide variety of</text><text start="543.06" dur="4.92">things and culture language economies uh</text><text start="545.94" dur="3.48">things of that sort and so the way I</text><text start="547.98" dur="3.24">break down in the book is that if you</text><text start="549.42" dur="4.02">look at how networks are understood what</text><text start="551.22" dur="3.84">are the elements of networks</text><text start="553.44" dur="3.72">um you know everyone talks about nodes</text><text start="555.06" dur="3.48">and links uh if we&apos;re talking about you</text><text start="557.16" dur="3.179">know say how this goes back to the</text><text start="558.54" dur="4.14">mathematics of graph Theory you talk</text><text start="560.339" dur="5.821">about edges and vertexes instead but you</text><text start="562.68" dur="5.04">know nodes and links in common parlance</text><text start="566.16" dur="3.54">um but then there are these two other</text><text start="567.72" dur="4.02">aspects that tend to get overlooked and</text><text start="569.7" dur="3.48">that&apos;s the background uh what I call</text><text start="571.74" dur="2.94">grounds</text><text start="573.18" dur="2.88">um you know in terms of say like you</text><text start="574.68" dur="3.18">know the Gestalt psychologists were</text><text start="576.06" dur="3.959">talking about a figure versus the ground</text><text start="577.86" dur="4.38">and how you can&apos;t really think one</text><text start="580.019" dur="4.621">without thinking the other or c one</text><text start="582.24" dur="3.539">without the other being implicit in some</text><text start="584.64" dur="2.94">way</text><text start="585.779" dur="3.961">um and then the issue of the emergence</text><text start="587.58" dur="5.28">of a network it has to always come from</text><text start="589.74" dur="5.82">somewhere in relation to a process and</text><text start="592.86" dur="4.8">so what I&apos;m doing takes these four sort</text><text start="595.56" dur="5.1">of elements of networks the node link</text><text start="597.66" dur="5.64">ground and process of emergence of an</text><text start="600.66" dur="4.619">entire network which usually manifests</text><text start="603.3" dur="5.159">as a level of a network the way in which</text><text start="605.279" dur="6.0">networks are nested in each other uh to</text><text start="608.459" dur="5.281">use that as a sort of structure for an</text><text start="611.279" dur="5.701">entire way to think about thinking and</text><text start="613.74" dur="5.46">linking and growing uh that can be then</text><text start="616.98" dur="3.9">uh you know threaded through a variety</text><text start="619.2" dur="4.02">of different domains to think about</text><text start="620.88" dur="5.94">natural phenomena political phenomena</text><text start="623.22" dur="5.76">cultural that sort of thing right</text><text start="626.82" dur="4.56">you know I I think that we&apos;re talking in</text><text start="628.98" dur="4.799">a lot of ways about the a priori</text><text start="631.38" dur="4.5">features of networks here and I&apos;d love</text><text start="633.779" dur="4.321">to get really empirical uh just to</text><text start="635.88" dur="3.18">ground this in the listener&apos;s mind you</text><text start="638.1" dur="3.0">know maybe you&apos;ve got a software</text><text start="639.06" dur="4.02">engineer who doesn&apos;t doesn&apos;t sort of uh</text><text start="641.1" dur="3.479">have have the vocabulary to talk about</text><text start="643.08" dur="3.48">networks from a math or a science</text><text start="644.579" dur="3.781">background or just for the general</text><text start="646.56" dur="4.14">audience can you ground this in an</text><text start="648.36" dur="3.96">empirical example of your favorite type</text><text start="650.7" dur="4.1">of network and how you deconstruct it</text><text start="652.32" dur="5.16">using this this language</text><text start="654.8" dur="4.3">there&apos;s a lot of possibilities uh I</text><text start="657.48" dur="4.5">would say anything that you could grab</text><text start="659.1" dur="4.739">with your hand uh anything any</text><text start="661.98" dur="5.58">experience could be understood as a node</text><text start="663.839" dur="6.961">but that node is a part of a network uh</text><text start="667.56" dur="5.04">but it&apos;s also a network itself uh that</text><text start="670.8" dur="3.42">is composed of other networks and other</text><text start="672.6" dur="4.02">nodes within those networks and that&apos;s</text><text start="674.22" dur="4.559">where the sort of fractal aspect of this</text><text start="676.62" dur="5.1">uh you know it&apos;s something where I look</text><text start="678.779" dur="5.581">at anything you could encounter as being</text><text start="681.72" dur="4.559">able to be broken down into nodes links</text><text start="684.36" dur="5.4">grounds and these sort of processes of</text><text start="686.279" dur="4.68">emergence uh individuation of distinct</text><text start="689.76" dur="3.54">things</text><text start="690.959" dur="5.101">um but yeah I mean anything chairs to</text><text start="693.3" dur="5.76">cells to molecules it&apos;s really a lens on</text><text start="696.06" dur="5.04">the world as much as anything else right</text><text start="699.06" dur="3.18">so it&apos;s maybe just to ground it for the</text><text start="701.1" dur="2.64">listener who maybe is listening</text><text start="702.24" dur="2.88">listening to this while they go for a</text><text start="703.74" dur="3.779">walk maybe they&apos;re on the subway maybe</text><text start="705.12" dur="4.08">they&apos;re on a bike ride uh that</text><text start="707.519" dur="3.841">experience could be understood as a</text><text start="709.2" dur="4.92">network of the neurons in their brain</text><text start="711.36" dur="5.82">receiving the audio input from the ear</text><text start="714.12" dur="6.3">and that gets them lost in some sort of</text><text start="717.18" dur="5.219">thought process which gets interjected</text><text start="720.42" dur="3.78">by their experience of I don&apos;t know</text><text start="722.399" dur="3.18">you&apos;re on the subway and say you stop</text><text start="724.2" dur="2.819">and so you have to shift your balance or</text><text start="725.579" dur="2.76">something like and this is me saying</text><text start="727.019" dur="3.0">back to you in layman&apos;s terms kind of</text><text start="728.339" dur="3.24">how I would reinterpret it but you know</text><text start="730.019" dur="3.06">for a listener who&apos;s listening to a</text><text start="731.579" dur="3.361">podcast how is how is that a network how</text><text start="733.079" dur="3.661">would you deconstruct that yeah I mean</text><text start="734.94" dur="4.56">there&apos;s the network of your experience</text><text start="736.74" dur="4.74">uh there&apos;s the network of the cells in</text><text start="739.5" dur="5.16">your body so we&apos;ve got physical networks</text><text start="741.48" dur="5.039">versus networks of feeling versus you</text><text start="744.66" dur="4.799">know and to some extent the I&apos;m trying</text><text start="746.519" dur="4.021">to undercut the mind-body dualism that</text><text start="749.459" dur="3.12">you know comes from people like</text><text start="750.54" dur="4.5">Descartes but also when you hear people</text><text start="752.579" dur="4.861">talk about the brain versus the mind</text><text start="755.04" dur="4.919">I just think the mind is another word</text><text start="757.44" dur="6.18">for how it feels to have a brain when</text><text start="759.959" dur="5.281">you&apos;re inside that brain and so the ways</text><text start="763.62" dur="3.779">in which all the cells Network together</text><text start="765.24" dur="4.2">produce this sort of agglomerated</text><text start="767.399" dur="4.081">experience but we could look at our</text><text start="769.44" dur="4.019">experience as you know when you see</text><text start="771.48" dur="4.62">something in the distance you see a</text><text start="773.459" dur="4.32">network of colors and shapes and that&apos;s</text><text start="776.1" dur="3.9">because of the way the networks of the</text><text start="777.779" dur="5.101">cells in your brain are doing what they</text><text start="780.0" dur="6.24">do and you&apos;re what that feels like</text><text start="782.88" dur="4.74">yeah yeah I I think that&apos;s really neat</text><text start="786.24" dur="3.14">and you know I think that one of the</text><text start="787.62" dur="4.62">themes on green pill that we talk about</text><text start="789.38" dur="4.78">is is not just Financial networks of</text><text start="792.24" dur="4.44">capital which is what I think crypto is</text><text start="794.16" dur="3.96">known about uh is known for but also</text><text start="796.68" dur="3.54">social networks</text><text start="798.12" dur="3.959">um experiential networks spiritual</text><text start="800.22" dur="3.299">Capital being something that&apos;s exchanged</text><text start="802.079" dur="4.081">in the space cultural capital being</text><text start="803.519" dur="5.341">exchanged in this space and so you know</text><text start="806.16" dur="4.919">I I sort of taking your networks within</text><text start="808.86" dur="4.38">networks analogy sort of think about the</text><text start="811.079" dur="4.32">listener being a part of the green pill</text><text start="813.24" dur="3.599">Network which is all about exploring how</text><text start="815.399" dur="3.601">crypto could be good for the world but</text><text start="816.839" dur="3.961">also the broader crypto Network which is</text><text start="819.0" dur="4.019">part of the complex system that is the</text><text start="820.8" dur="3.839">world so I&apos;d be interested in sort of</text><text start="823.019" dur="3.721">transitioning to talking about networks</text><text start="824.639" dur="3.481">of humans that are interconnected via</text><text start="826.74" dur="3.96">the Internet and maybe learning and</text><text start="828.12" dur="4.32">evolving together because that&apos;s what we</text><text start="830.7" dur="4.02">think in the Dallas space that we think</text><text start="832.44" dur="4.62">that Dallas can disrupt or networks can</text><text start="834.72" dur="5.1">disrupt hierarchies because networks can</text><text start="837.06" dur="5.579">learn and expand from the edges whereas</text><text start="839.82" dur="4.259">hierarchies can only deploy force in One</text><text start="842.639" dur="2.76">Direction action and maybe hierarchies</text><text start="844.079" dur="3.181">are a network also but there&apos;s a</text><text start="845.399" dur="3.901">specific type of network that that comes</text><text start="847.26" dur="3.06">very top down and so I know what do you</text><text start="849.3" dur="3.36">have to say about about internet</text><text start="850.32" dur="5.1">networks is probably a lot there but I</text><text start="852.66" dur="5.28">curious where you&apos;d start I mean when we</text><text start="855.42" dur="4.68">look at the waste uh sociologists uh</text><text start="857.94" dur="4.26">have really gotten into the study of</text><text start="860.1" dur="3.78">network phenomena uh you know like</text><text start="862.2" dur="3.3">there&apos;s just so many papers that have</text><text start="863.88" dur="4.579">been written in the last you know 10 15</text><text start="865.5" dur="5.519">years about social networks and</text><text start="868.459" dur="5.38">diagramming out how you know say the</text><text start="871.019" dur="4.861">organizational structure of a company uh</text><text start="873.839" dur="3.841">tends to be so you know top down and you</text><text start="875.88" dur="3.84">see those organization charts and then</text><text start="877.68" dur="4.92">you look at what&apos;s going on on Facebook</text><text start="879.72" dur="4.559">and Twitter and you can plot out social</text><text start="882.6" dur="4.02">networks that are infinitely more</text><text start="884.279" dur="3.901">organic looking more complex and</text><text start="886.62" dur="4.2">distributed</text><text start="888.18" dur="5.04">um in ways that are you know that really</text><text start="890.82" dur="4.44">look more like how nature grows things</text><text start="893.22" dur="5.88">rather than you know the sort of</text><text start="895.26" dur="5.819">top-down imposed super centralized stuff</text><text start="899.1" dur="4.919">um and you know where I think this gets</text><text start="901.079" dur="5.221">super interesting is between the</text><text start="904.019" dur="3.781">extremes because you know certainly you</text><text start="906.3" dur="3.599">could say well there&apos;s decentralized</text><text start="907.8" dur="3.36">networks and then there&apos;s centralized</text><text start="909.899" dur="3.781">networks and I think most people have</text><text start="911.16" dur="4.56">sort of you know encountered the sort of</text><text start="913.68" dur="4.26">extra dreams of thinking through like</text><text start="915.72" dur="4.58">okay like you know what goes on on the</text><text start="917.94" dur="4.56">Internet is seems relatively</text><text start="920.3" dur="4.779">decentralized but then there&apos;s the</text><text start="922.5" dur="5.1">centralized level of protocol uh of the</text><text start="925.079" dur="5.161">code underneath and especially platforms</text><text start="927.6" dur="5.66">like Facebook and uh you know Google</text><text start="930.24" dur="5.7">that are really sort of producing</text><text start="933.26" dur="5.439">centralized uh infrastructure which is</text><text start="935.94" dur="4.8">something you talk about green pills</text><text start="938.699" dur="3.14">um in a way that produces what what I</text><text start="940.74" dur="3.36">would think of as like a</text><text start="941.839" dur="4.781">quasi-decentralized experience it seems</text><text start="944.1" dur="3.9">decentralized in some ways but there&apos;s a</text><text start="946.62" dur="3.54">bottleneck</text><text start="948.0" dur="4.019">um and I think that&apos;s very similar to</text><text start="950.16" dur="4.38">capitalism uh you know in capitalism</text><text start="952.019" dur="4.741">there&apos;s the appearance of well you can</text><text start="954.54" dur="4.26">do anything you could buy anything you</text><text start="956.76" dur="4.74">could create anything but it&apos;s all</text><text start="958.8" dur="5.039">modulated by the system of finance and</text><text start="961.5" dur="4.68">you know if it doesn&apos;t link into the</text><text start="963.839" dur="4.261">money form in some ways</text><text start="966.18" dur="4.5">um it&apos;s kind of illegible to Capital we</text><text start="968.1" dur="4.5">talk about modernization</text><text start="970.68" dur="5.58">um as soon as you start playing the game</text><text start="972.6" dur="7.14">of monetization uh there&apos;s all of the</text><text start="976.26" dur="5.819">the sort of uh background networks that</text><text start="979.74" dur="5.099">modulate things from afar like finance</text><text start="982.079" dur="4.5">and you know the stock markets right the</text><text start="984.839" dur="4.62">sort of algorithmic trading that&apos;s going</text><text start="986.579" dur="5.161">on so I think you know we tend to</text><text start="989.459" dur="4.921">think that the world is just centralized</text><text start="991.74" dur="4.98">versus decentralized and I would like to</text><text start="994.38" dur="4.259">see it more uh in terms of these sort of</text><text start="996.72" dur="4.26">hybrid structures</text><text start="998.639" dur="4.44">um and that some of these are</text><text start="1000.98" dur="4.62">peer decentralized but are actually</text><text start="1003.079" dur="4.741">centralized underneath and others are</text><text start="1005.6" dur="3.539">much more distributed and so if you look</text><text start="1007.82" dur="3.06">at sort of the way in which scientists</text><text start="1009.139" dur="3.481">will talk about networks very often it&apos;s</text><text start="1010.88" dur="4.92">not so much decentralized versus</text><text start="1012.62" dur="5.7">centralized but distributed versus</text><text start="1015.8" dur="4.62">something else and that&apos;s something else</text><text start="1018.32" dur="4.439">I think is what say capitalism does it&apos;s</text><text start="1020.42" dur="4.56">what big Tech does uh and in my book I</text><text start="1022.759" dur="3.961">call those sort of paranoid networks or</text><text start="1024.98" dur="3.66">hybrid Networks</text><text start="1026.72" dur="4.44">um yeah I mean I know that one of the</text><text start="1028.64" dur="5.76">sort of web three criticisms of web 2 is</text><text start="1031.16" dur="4.799">that with let&apos;s call it I&apos;ll just pick a</text><text start="1034.4" dur="3.539">random example but Google you know you</text><text start="1035.959" dur="3.6">take a you you search and then over time</text><text start="1037.939" dur="2.701">Google can build a profile of you and</text><text start="1039.559" dur="3.0">then they can sell you more efficient</text><text start="1040.64" dur="4.26">ads and it all runs through data</text><text start="1042.559" dur="3.301">Google&apos;s data data centers and I think</text><text start="1044.9" dur="2.939">that</text><text start="1045.86" dur="3.96">um you know in a way that&apos;s built on TCP</text><text start="1047.839" dur="3.84">which the specification of is</text><text start="1049.82" dur="3.66">centralized but it&apos;s running in a</text><text start="1051.679" dur="3.601">diffuse way across all of these networks</text><text start="1053.48" dur="3.18">of nodes across so it&apos;s so it&apos;s</text><text start="1055.28" dur="3.54">decentralized in the way it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="1056.66" dur="4.92">implemented and but the fact that we all</text><text start="1058.82" dur="5.46">agree on the standard of TCP is the</text><text start="1061.58" dur="5.099">network and then further up the stack we</text><text start="1064.28" dur="3.96">Google has a network effect literally of</text><text start="1066.679" dur="3.12">more people using Google so it becomes</text><text start="1068.24" dur="3.36">more useful for everyone but it all</text><text start="1069.799" dur="3.301">flows through their data centers and and</text><text start="1071.6" dur="4.079">I think that what ethereum is trying to</text><text start="1073.1" dur="5.28">do is we&apos;re it&apos;s trying to make a group</text><text start="1075.679" dur="5.101">of people agree on a consensus protocol</text><text start="1078.38" dur="5.64">proof of stake through which the network</text><text start="1080.78" dur="6.72">of nodes can come to consensus of what</text><text start="1084.02" dur="5.88">the network of of people uh what their</text><text start="1087.5" dur="3.66">balance is is or the state of the evm if</text><text start="1089.9" dur="4.8">you want to get more complex than just</text><text start="1091.16" dur="5.519">Financial capital and the agreement of</text><text start="1094.7" dur="3.78">that standard creates a network effect</text><text start="1096.679" dur="3.481">but it&apos;s not flowing through vitalik</text><text start="1098.48" dur="4.14">buterin&apos;s data center in the same way</text><text start="1100.16" dur="4.74">that Google gets all of the web traffic</text><text start="1102.62" dur="4.98">in the world and so it&apos;s it&apos;s like it&apos;s</text><text start="1104.9" dur="4.62">more capture resistant because although</text><text start="1107.6" dur="4.14">vitalik has soft power he doesn&apos;t have</text><text start="1109.52" dur="4.26">the hard power of being able to change</text><text start="1111.74" dur="3.48">the consensus nodes of the network and</text><text start="1113.78" dur="3.72">so you know I think that we&apos;re maybe</text><text start="1115.22" dur="4.319">complexifying this a little bit but I</text><text start="1117.5" dur="5.1">would posit that web 2 and web3 are</text><text start="1119.539" dur="4.441">different types of of hybrid networks uh</text><text start="1122.6" dur="3.06">what do you what do you think of that</text><text start="1123.98" dur="3.96">yeah no I mean I think that the</text><text start="1125.66" dur="4.98">potential for web 3 to be socially</text><text start="1127.94" dur="4.2">disruptive is enormous and to be</text><text start="1130.64" dur="4.26">socially disruptive and potentially</text><text start="1132.14" dur="4.44">really good ways uh you know I think</text><text start="1134.9" dur="3.48">Dao&apos;s</text><text start="1136.58" dur="4.26">um at least as they&apos;re currently being</text><text start="1138.38" dur="4.2">formulated uh you know in terms of say</text><text start="1140.84" dur="3.959">the ethereum base and consensus</text><text start="1142.58" dur="4.5">mechanisms you know I think there&apos;s no</text><text start="1144.799" dur="3.841">reason to think that this would not be</text><text start="1147.08" dur="5.04">in some ways the future of social</text><text start="1148.64" dur="5.34">organizing uh you know I mean we see the</text><text start="1152.12" dur="4.32">sorts of online distributed communities</text><text start="1153.98" dur="5.96">that rose up around Wikipedia uh that</text><text start="1156.44" dur="6.599">rose up around Reddit uh clearly</text><text start="1159.94" dur="4.84">ethereum is is poised to take that to a</text><text start="1163.039" dur="4.681">whole Next Level and I think it&apos;s not</text><text start="1164.78" dur="4.5">it&apos;s not a joke to say or even a stretch</text><text start="1167.72" dur="4.8">to imagine that political parties</text><text start="1169.28" dur="5.1">governments uh really could start to</text><text start="1172.52" dur="3.779">have some competition you know these</text><text start="1174.38" dur="4.2">sort of Legacy institutions that it will</text><text start="1176.299" dur="3.841">take time obviously but I think it&apos;s one</text><text start="1178.58" dur="3.959">of those things where you know you see a</text><text start="1180.14" dur="4.919">slow burn of early adopters and then all</text><text start="1182.539" dur="5.041">of a sudden in a time of crisis or</text><text start="1185.059" dur="4.561">opportunity uh you know that a

dur="3.9">all of a sudden you have an avalanche of</text><text start="1194.12" dur="3.299">people adopting it uh and I think the</text><text start="1196.22" dur="2.88">internet was that way in its early</text><text start="1197.419" dur="4.021">stages you know originally people were</text><text start="1199.1" dur="4.92">just like what exactly would I use this</text><text start="1201.44" dur="5.22">for and then it just hit an inflection</text><text start="1204.02" dur="4.26">point where everyone was using it for</text><text start="1206.66" dur="3.42">everything and the transition was pretty</text><text start="1208.28" dur="3.42">rapid and I think that tends to be how</text><text start="1210.08" dur="3.959">technology works you get those early</text><text start="1211.7" dur="4.68">adopters and you know they sort of</text><text start="1214.039" dur="4.861">pioneer the space and then you just hit</text><text start="1216.38" dur="6.06">a critical mass and so I think yeah web3</text><text start="1218.9" dur="5.399">is going to uh you know you&apos;re gonna</text><text start="1222.44" dur="4.08">start to have new types of distributed</text><text start="1224.299" dur="4.321">organization of humans that can just do</text><text start="1226.52" dur="4.38">with smart contracts you know things</text><text start="1228.62" dur="4.559">like distributed filmmaking and</text><text start="1230.9" dur="4.38">distributed art projects and you know</text><text start="1233.179" dur="4.261">distributed social movements the only</text><text start="1235.28" dur="6.24">thing I worry about is what happens when</text><text start="1237.44" dur="6.18">you know uh not only Legacy Works to</text><text start="1241.52" dur="5.46">co-op this but also when you start</text><text start="1243.62" dur="5.4">having extreme right wing Dows extreme</text><text start="1246.98" dur="3.6">fascist Dows you know like we have to</text><text start="1249.02" dur="4.26">think about</text><text start="1250.58" dur="4.74">um how these new technologies would be</text><text start="1253.28" dur="6.18">appropriated</text><text start="1255.32" dur="5.52">um and used in ways that might not be</text><text start="1259.46" dur="2.82">um you know you speak a lot about public</text><text start="1260.84" dur="2.88">goods</text><text start="1262.28" dur="3.899">um you know I worry about like when</text><text start="1263.72" dur="5.04">people Define public and good in some</text><text start="1266.179" dur="4.921">very exclusive ways that these could be</text><text start="1268.76" dur="5.4">disruptive technologies that are also</text><text start="1271.1" dur="5.939">not not helpful not good ones and maybe</text><text start="1274.16" dur="4.62">Dangerous Ones so I think any technology</text><text start="1277.039" dur="3.781">has that potential we need to think</text><text start="1278.78" dur="3.66">about that uh when things are in their</text><text start="1280.82" dur="4.68">infancy so we could set up structures</text><text start="1282.44" dur="4.8">that can keep things egalitarian yeah</text><text start="1285.5" dur="3.12">yeah I mean I think that there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="1287.24" dur="3.9">there and I think I would summarize a</text><text start="1288.62" dur="4.799">lot of what you said by the in the in</text><text start="1291.14" dur="4.98">the frame of uh web threes Network</text><text start="1293.419" dur="4.981">allergies Plus Finance networked Finance</text><text start="1296.12"

good for</text><text start="1301.1" dur="4.62">the world instead of just socially</text><text start="1302.9" dur="5.7">disruptive and in many different</text><text start="1305.72" dur="7.1">directions is that a fair summary</text><text start="1308.6" dur="4.22">uh I I don&apos;t you know I</text><text start="1313.72" dur="4.42">web 3 is its own thing and you know I</text><text start="1316.76" dur="3.899">don&apos;t know if it&apos;s necessarily network</text><text start="1318.14" dur="3.779">network allergies a set of lenses to</text><text start="1320.659" dur="3.721">look at the world you know it&apos;s like</text><text start="1321.919" dur="3.901">it&apos;s it&apos;s a wager it&apos;s like if we look</text><text start="1324.38" dur="3.12">at everything in the world through the</text><text start="1325.82" dur="3.239">network you know through the lens of</text><text start="1327.5" dur="3.24">networks what does the world look like</text><text start="1329.059" dur="4.021">what do we what does that allow us to</text><text start="1330.74" dur="4.62">see that we couldn&apos;t see before whereas</text><text start="1333.08" dur="4.86">web free is a new set of Technologies</text><text start="1335.36" dur="5.22">and you know I think the consensus</text><text start="1337.94" dur="5.04">mechanisms the the sort of uh you know</text><text start="1340.58" dur="4.62">very specific types of tokenization</text><text start="1342.98" dur="3.78">purpose-driven tokens and you know like</text><text start="1345.2" dur="5.099">there&apos;s all sorts of new ways of</text><text start="1346.76" dur="4.26">creating Social Links and I think you</text><text start="1350.299" dur="3.661">know</text><text start="1351.02" dur="4.68">the question is what is what are the</text><text start="1353.96" dur="2.94">stakes of that where could that lead</text><text start="1355.7" dur="2.58">yeah</text><text start="1356.9" dur="2.94">yeah I mean you know I would love to</text><text start="1358.28" dur="3.42">spend the rest of the episode or at</text><text start="1359.84" dur="3.66">least another 20 minutes just talking</text><text start="1361.7" dur="3.12">about these network network logical</text><text start="1363.5" dur="3.48">principles and applying them to Dallas</text><text start="1364.82" dur="4.26">and web3 I mean you know like to me</text><text start="1366.98" dur="5.16">there&apos;s some very obvious examples like</text><text start="1369.08" dur="5.4">Dow Forks or Forks of any code is kind</text><text start="1372.14" dur="3.539">of like a practicality of the web 3</text><text start="1374.48" dur="4.14">based Network everything here is open</text><text start="1375.679" dur="4.801">source um the emergence of how git coin</text><text start="1378.62" dur="3.6">dial Works basically is that every</text><text start="1380.48" dur="4.62">quarter it has a governance</text><text start="1382.22" dur="4.5">governance process and then it runs a</text><text start="1385.1" dur="5.22">grants round and what emerges</text><text start="1386.72" dur="5.76">iteratively over that is is sort of the</text><text start="1390.32" dur="4.5">direction that get coined out is is</text><text start="1392.48" dur="5.04">evolving and then the relationship of</text><text start="1394.82" dur="6.18">the nodes of the the people in each</text><text start="1397.52" dur="5.519">network uh say in ens if I buy an ens</text><text start="1401.0" dur="3.24">domain then that makes the network more</text><text start="1403.039" dur="2.701">valuable for everyone else because</text><text start="1404.24" dur="2.819">there&apos;s more people who have ens there&apos;s</text><text start="1405.74" dur="3.24">a network effect because of the</text><text start="1407.059" dur="3.181">relationality of the people in there so</text><text start="1408.98" dur="2.52">I mean those are the obvious examples</text><text start="1410.24" dur="3.12">for me when I take these principles and</text><text start="1411.5" dur="4.14">I apply them to dowels but you know I&apos;m</text><text start="1413.36" dur="4.199">clear I&apos;m curious to just sort of take</text><text start="1415.64" dur="3.72">your expertise on networks and take that</text><text start="1417.559" dur="3.24">lens and apply it to web3 like what do</text><text start="1419.36" dur="2.76">you what do you think of web3 I guess is</text><text start="1420.799" dur="4.86">the most broad question that I can</text><text start="1422.12" dur="6.0">follow you back to you oh I mean we&apos;re</text><text start="1425.659" dur="4.26">at the tip of the iceberg I mean web3 I</text><text start="1428.12" dur="3.9">don&apos;t think there&apos;s any any reason to</text><text start="1429.919" dur="3.721">think it wouldn&apos;t be revolutionary and</text><text start="1432.02" dur="3.96">you know whenever you introduce a new</text><text start="1433.64" dur="4.62">technology it tends to be as destructive</text><text start="1435.98" dur="5.22">as much as creative uh even if in just</text><text start="1438.26" dur="5.1">pushing Legacy mechanisms to the side</text><text start="1441.2" dur="4.2">um so you know I think it&apos;s hard to</text><text start="1443.36" dur="3.84">imagine what&apos;s going to happen but you</text><text start="1445.4" dur="3.6">know I think you do need to think from</text><text start="1447.2" dur="4.32">the earliest stages like what happens</text><text start="1449.0" dur="5.52">when hyper right wing movements you know</text><text start="1451.52" dur="6.06">start thinking in these terms and can</text><text start="1454.52" dur="5.82">can things be done now to make it more</text><text start="1457.58" dur="4.68">difficult to co-op this stuff for forms</text><text start="1460.34" dur="4.68">of you know traditional capitalism and</text><text start="1462.26" dur="5.64">things of that nature uh what I tend to</text><text start="1465.02" dur="5.76">do with my work is to look at</text><text start="1467.9" dur="4.32">um emergence as a phenomena uh which is</text><text start="1470.78" dur="3.3">you know where a lot of the science of</text><text start="1472.22" dur="3.66">networks is studying how emergencies</text><text start="1474.08" dur="4.079">happen how</text><text start="1475.88" dur="4.5">um in natural systems in economic</text><text start="1478.159" dur="4.561">systems you have the sort of</text><text start="1480.38" dur="5.279">um sort of spontaneous production of new</text><text start="1482.72" dur="6.36">forms of complexity once certain factors</text><text start="1485.659" dur="5.64">are there and so studying like what are</text><text start="1489.08" dur="4.92">the factors that make things robust that</text><text start="1491.299" dur="4.74">make them resilient that tend to lead to</text><text start="1494.0" dur="5.76">the spontaneous growth of sustainable</text><text start="1496.039" dur="5.101">complexity uh and creativity and I think</text><text start="1499.76" dur="3.659">you know the best thing we can do there</text><text start="1501.14" dur="4.56">is study how it works in nature and</text><text start="1503.419" dur="4.201">study biological processes and social</text><text start="1505.7" dur="3.959">processes that we already look at and</text><text start="1507.62" dur="4.38">we&apos;re just like wow that&apos;s great that</text><text start="1509.659" dur="4.801">Fosters creative development it&apos;s</text><text start="1512.0" dur="5.4">sustainable how can we reproduce some of</text><text start="1514.46" dur="6.719">those features in our you know sort of</text><text start="1517.4" dur="5.82">uh attempts to structure web 3 uh you</text><text start="1521.179" dur="4.561">know tokens structure incentive</text><text start="1523.22" dur="4.559">mechanisms uh various forms of you know</text><text start="1525.74" dur="4.439">proof of work proof of stake those sorts</text><text start="1527.779" dur="4.5">of uh ways in which we create the smart</text><text start="1530.179" dur="3.901">contracts because if we&apos;re thinking game</text><text start="1532.279" dur="4.621">theoretic here</text><text start="1534.08" dur="4.86">um I think you know people really do</text><text start="1536.9" dur="4.379">make decisions based on incentives but I</text><text start="1538.94" dur="5.46">think it&apos;s also very difficult a lot of</text><text start="1541.279" dur="5.241">the time to determine which incentives</text><text start="1544.4" dur="4.56">are operative in a given social domain</text><text start="1546.52" dur="5.8">whether there might not be multiple</text><text start="1548.96" dur="6.42">forms of incentives and how uh we might</text><text start="1552.32" dur="4.32">oversimplify like I was looking uh you</text><text start="1555.38" dur="4.2">know with sort of what happened with</text><text start="1556.64" dur="4.8">some of the earlier Dows and how they uh</text><text start="1559.58" dur="4.199">didn&apos;t expect certain types of attacks</text><text start="1561.44" dur="4.5">based on uh the way they structure their</text><text start="1563.779" dur="4.201">incentive structure and you know got</text><text start="1565.94" dur="4.8">wiped out pretty early on</text><text start="1567.98" dur="4.38">um and so you know thinking through the</text><text start="1570.74" dur="4.799">ways in which</text><text start="1572.36" dur="5.28">um Legacy forms of incentive uh might</text><text start="1575.539" dur="3.481">relate to the ways in which they&apos;re</text><text start="1577.64" dur="4.5">structured in smart contracts in</text><text start="1579.02" dur="4.74">unexpected ways yeah you know you know</text><text start="1582.14" dur="3.3">as you&apos;re speaking sort of about the</text><text start="1583.76" dur="3.539">emergence of this ecosystem I was</text><text start="1585.44" dur="4.619">reminded of the episode that I did with</text><text start="1587.299" dur="5.88">Chase Chapman who&apos;s kind of a uh a</text><text start="1590.059" dur="4.561">really OG and uh smart doll person but</text><text start="1593.179" dur="5.1">she was talking about this thing called</text><text start="1594.62" dur="7.02">gals law which is basically that a more</text><text start="1598.279" dur="5.101">complex system can evolve in from a more</text><text start="1601.64" dur="3.779">simple system so you&apos;ve got you just</text><text start="1603.38" dur="3.96">start out with a more simple system and</text><text start="1605.419" dur="3.961">then that&apos;s wrong but being wrong is the</text><text start="1607.34" dur="3.48">only way to be right and then you evolve</text><text start="1609.38" dur="3.539">that simple system into a more complex</text><text start="1610.82" dur="6.0">system and I see that in if you look at</text><text start="1612.919" dur="5.521">the Dao from 2016 which was grew so fast</text><text start="1616.82" dur="3.06">into like holding eight percent of all</text><text start="1618.44" dur="2.94">ether and then it got hacked and then it</text><text start="1619.88" dur="3.779">collapsed yeah that&apos;s the one I&apos;m</text><text start="1621.38" dur="4.86">thinking of yes yeah and then and then</text><text start="1623.659" dur="6.181">but so Amin solimani launched molokdao</text><text start="1626.24" dur="4.919">in 2018 2019 and all that was was a</text><text start="1629.84" dur="3.48">smart contract that except you could</text><text start="1631.159" dur="3.301">join it you could submit proposals and</text><text start="1633.32" dur="3.06">then you could do this thing called Rage</text><text start="1634.46" dur="4.62">Quit which was exited and it was just a</text><text start="1636.38" dur="3.96">much simpler State machine that I I</text><text start="1639.08" dur="4.14">think it more is more representative guy</text><text start="1640.34" dur="4.86">law and now we&apos;ve evolved as an</text><text start="1643.22" dur="3.6">ecosystem hundreds of different moloch</text><text start="1645.2" dur="4.26">dials from that simple instruction set</text><text start="1646.82" dur="4.92">so uh yeah I mean the embracing that</text><text start="1649.46" dur="3.839">evolutionarily is I think maybe</text><text start="1651.74" dur="4.679">something that the ecosystem had to</text><text start="1653.299" dur="5.76">learn through the years well I think you</text><text start="1656.419" dur="5.041">know when I say looking at natural sort</text><text start="1659.059" dur="4.681">of models for inspiration uh yeah</text><text start="1661.46" dur="4.86">something like bird flocking and or the</text><text start="1663.74" dur="4.08">schooling of fish and the the</text><text start="1666.32" dur="3.12">simulations that are done of these</text><text start="1667.82" dur="3.54">because you can&apos;t use differential</text><text start="1669.44" dur="4.56">equations to model what&apos;s going on</text><text start="1671.36" dur="4.38">there&apos;s too many too many agents too</text><text start="1674.0" dur="3.779">many forms of relationality at too many</text><text start="1675.74" dur="4.2">levels of scale you just get your</text><text start="1677.779" dur="3.681">variables though off the chart and you</text><text start="1679.94" dur="3.3">know we just there&apos;s too many</text><text start="1681.46" dur="3.28">non-linearities in the equations</text><text start="1683.24" dur="3.12">essentially</text><text start="1684.74" dur="3.78">um and so that&apos;s why they found that you</text><text start="1686.36" dur="4.199">know we could just create uh simulations</text><text start="1688.52" dur="4.08">that you know have a couple of very</text><text start="1690.559" dur="4.441">basic agents that follow a couple of</text><text start="1692.6" dur="4.86">very little interaction rules and all of</text><text start="1695.0" dur="6.419">a sudden you get your virtual Birds uh</text><text start="1697.46" dur="6.18">to flock and I think simulation</text><text start="1701.419" dur="4.26">um you know especially when you use uh</text><text start="1703.64" dur="4.8">you know basic agents to do agent-based</text><text start="1705.679" dur="4.321">modeling can I think help</text><text start="1708.44" dur="3.54">um sort of</text><text start="1710.0" dur="4.799">perhaps anticipate some of the things</text><text start="1711.98" dur="4.679">that could go wrong in various ways</text><text start="1714.799" dur="4.5">um but I think they it also indicates</text><text start="1716.659" dur="4.741">the ways in which you know as</text><text start="1719.299" dur="5.401">um as you mentioned Simplicity often</text><text start="1721.4" dur="6.06">gives rise to massive complexity in the</text><text start="1724.7" dur="4.62">right interactional sort of domains uh</text><text start="1727.46" dur="3.959">and that&apos;s why the the work I&apos;m doing</text><text start="1729.32" dur="5.4">now is looking at what are the factors</text><text start="1731.419" dur="6.061">that potentiate emergence uh and you</text><text start="1734.72" dur="4.819">know from all the science that I can you</text><text start="1737.48" dur="4.62">know piece together because complex</text><text start="1739.539" dur="4.541">really they do disagree on some of this</text><text start="1742.1" dur="4.14">stuff it&apos;s more like we know it when we</text><text start="1744.08" dur="4.92">see it but if you look at if you boil</text><text start="1746.24" dur="4.86">down all the different perspectives</text><text start="1749.0" dur="4.26">um in the work I&apos;m doing</text><text start="1751.1" dur="4.74">um I I basically break it down to four</text><text start="1753.26" dur="5.1">things right A diversity of the</text><text start="1755.84" dur="4.02">materials uh relationality of the</text><text start="1758.36" dur="4.02">connections</text><text start="1759.86" dur="3.84">um the sort of distributedness of the</text><text start="1762.38" dur="3.299">structure</text><text start="1763.7" dur="4.92">um especially in relationship to grounds</text><text start="1765.679" dur="4.681">and contexts and then meta stability in</text><text start="1768.62" dur="4.34">terms of the process</text><text start="1770.36" dur="5.699">and it&apos;s particularly these last two</text><text start="1772.96" dur="5.68">distributedness of organization and meta</text><text start="1776.059" dur="4.5">stability of its Dynamics uh those are</text><text start="1778.64" dur="5.46">the things that I think tend to be left</text><text start="1780.559" dur="6.36">out of engineered systems and when you</text><text start="1784.1" dur="5.64">have them in nature they just

dur="5.22">the more meta-stable the organization</text><text start="1793.7" dur="6.06">you know neither stable nor unstable uh</text><text start="1797.24" dur="6.78">but right on the cusp you know sort of a</text><text start="1799.76" dur="5.94">maximum tolerable chaos uh you know on</text><text start="1804.02" dur="4.44">the on the edge of chaos as the</text><text start="1805.7" dur="5.42">scientists kind of say yeah not chaotic</text><text start="1808.46" dur="5.28">but not unchaotic</text><text start="1811.12" dur="5.98">that&apos;s where you get those interesting</text><text start="1813.74" dur="5.84">accidents occur that just be the</text><text start="1817.1" dur="5.28">production of new creative Direction</text><text start="1819.58" dur="4.66">yeah right well next time uh someone</text><text start="1822.38" dur="3.659">says the Dow is chukatic I&apos;m gonna say</text><text start="1824.24" dur="4.26">we&apos;re at the point of maximal tolerable</text><text start="1826.039" dur="4.26">okay chaotic which is actually about</text><text start="1828.5" dur="4.799">what a full Rebrand does meta stability</text><text start="1830.299" dur="4.681">and and it&apos;ll be a good thing but but</text><text start="1833.299" dur="3.6">you know what now but that feels like a</text><text start="1834.98" dur="3.12">real Alpha leak those four criteria for</text><text start="1836.899" dur="3.481">uh</text><text start="1838.1" dur="4.02">uh for emergence um could we go over</text><text start="1840.38" dur="4.019">them real quick one more time uh I know</text><text start="1842.12" dur="4.34">we ended with meta stability well just</text><text start="1844.399" dur="4.5">sort of just um the</text><text start="1846.46" dur="4.8">differentiation that produces the</text><text start="1848.899" dur="4.64">diversity of materials and then</text><text start="1851.26" dur="4.48">interrelated forms of networking</text><text start="1853.539" dur="3.281">interconnectedness and then when we&apos;re</text><text start="1855.74" dur="2.52">talking about</text><text start="1856.82" dur="3.9">um you know sort of distributedness</text><text start="1858.26" dur="5.1">particularly uh Modes of organization</text><text start="1860.72" dur="5.28">but in relation to context as well and</text><text start="1863.36" dur="5.039">then meta stability of Dynamics so</text><text start="1866.0" dur="4.38">essentially diversity networking</text><text start="1868.399" dur="4.681">distributedness</text><text start="1870.38" dur="4.38">um and metastability right yeah that</text><text start="1873.08" dur="3.479">just triggered another thought for me uh</text><text start="1874.76" dur="3.539">we&apos;re gonna have David ehrlichmann on</text><text start="1876.559" dur="3.24">the Pod soon and he wrote a book called</text><text start="1878.299" dur="3.961">impact networks and one of the key</text><text start="1879.799" dur="3.781">points of that was the strength of the</text><text start="1882.26" dur="3.659">relationships and the trust and the</text><text start="1883.58" dur="3.9">Rapport of the people in your network is</text><text start="1885.919" dur="3.841">actually</text><text start="1887.48" dur="4.02">the Network&apos;s value and its ability to</text><text start="1889.76" dur="3.48">get stuff done so that reminded me of</text><text start="1891.5" dur="5.039">the second point there of the relations</text><text start="1893.24" dur="5.34">between the nodes what&apos;s interesting you</text><text start="1896.539" dur="4.161">know is people who have studied uh the</text><text start="1898.58" dur="5.88">most effective sorts of cultural capital</text><text start="1900.7" dur="6.28">uh and the ways in which uh networks are</text><text start="1904.46" dur="4.62">resilient and robust and creative it&apos;s</text><text start="1906.98" dur="4.319">not the strongest links that tend to</text><text start="1909.08" dur="4.199">really potentiate thing it&apos;s it&apos;s the</text><text start="1911.299" dur="3.541">weaker links and so you hear a lot of</text><text start="1913.279" dur="4.801">network scientists will talk about the</text><text start="1914.84" dur="6.36">strength of weak ties uh the sort of you</text><text start="1918.08" dur="4.74">know it&apos;s it&apos;s the ties that are you</text><text start="1921.2" dur="3.54">know perhaps you wouldn&apos;t think to use</text><text start="1922.82" dur="4.62">them but in the right situation those</text><text start="1924.74" dur="5.039">become the key to everything and so we</text><text start="1927.44" dur="4.02">started discussions of things like small</text><text start="1929.779" dur="3.841">worldedness</text><text start="1931.46" dur="4.5">um and the ways it&apos;s a term that they</text><text start="1933.62" dur="4.919">use in the science to talk about</text><text start="1935.96" dur="5.459">um neither too many nor too few links</text><text start="1938.539" dur="5.041">but also varying numbers of links</text><text start="1941.419" dur="4.38">between the different nodes that some</text><text start="1943.58" dur="4.8">remain more locally focused some remain</text><text start="1945.799" dur="6.0">more long distance focused and you get</text><text start="1948.38" dur="5.22">this sort of modularity uh and best of</text><text start="1951.799" dur="3.48">all worlds kind of thing where you you</text><text start="1953.6" dur="3.66">know you have some nodes that can hyper</text><text start="1955.279" dur="4.14">Focus some that really special it&apos;s an</text><text start="1957.26" dur="4.08">interconnection and that&apos;s how organisms</text><text start="1959.419" dur="3.721">work you know you have nerves that are</text><text start="1961.34" dur="3.839">more specialized with long distance</text><text start="1963.14" dur="3.84">stuff versus you know sort of</text><text start="1965.179" dur="3.841">specialized organs that each play their</text><text start="1966.98" dur="4.5">role so again a lot of this is coming</text><text start="1969.02" dur="4.2">from the study of natural processes yeah</text><text start="1971.48" dur="5.52">I think this is so beautiful to use</text><text start="1973.22" dur="5.939">biomimicry and studying economic systems</text><text start="1977.0" dur="3.659">as a way of understanding networks</text><text start="1979.159" dur="3.361">because you can just see what&apos;s</text><text start="1980.659" dur="3.24">organically emerged and by the way these</text><text start="1982.52" dur="3.24">are complex systems I mean crypto</text><text start="1983.899" dur="4.201">economic systems are a subset of</text><text start="1985.76" dur="5.1">economic systems social systems which</text><text start="1988.1" dur="4.559">are complex and the complex systems are</text><text start="1990.86" dur="4.14">complicated like it&apos;s it&apos;s literally in</text><text start="1992.659" dur="4.321">the name and so just having an allegory</text><text start="1995.0" dur="3.659">to biology and economics I think I think</text><text start="1996.98" dur="2.76">matters a lot what else is there to</text><text start="1998.659" dur="3.961">learn there</text><text start="1999.74" dur="4.86">well I mean I think capitalism you look</text><text start="2002.62" dur="4.679">at capitalism and the first thing that</text><text start="2004.6" dur="5.1">comes to my mind is cancer uh you know</text><text start="2007.299" dur="6.12">like capitalism is a structure that</text><text start="2009.7" dur="6.0">produces a how much that homogeneous</text><text start="2013.419" dur="4.321">product and it&apos;s yeah everything gets</text><text start="2015.7" dur="4.319">reduced to quantities of the same thing</text><text start="2017.74" dur="4.14">and those who have more of that same</text><text start="2020.019" dur="4.26">thing are able to sort of bias the</text><text start="2021.88" dur="4.5">playing field and this is where you know</text><text start="2024.279" dur="4.321">things like protecting against civil</text><text start="2026.38" dur="4.08">attacks and stuff you know when when you</text><text start="2028.6" dur="4.919">look at how Dows are structured you&apos;re</text><text start="2030.46" dur="5.28">trying to make sure that uh those who</text><text start="2033.519" dur="5.16">have more capital in the Legacy space</text><text start="2035.74" dur="5.34">can&apos;t necessarily have more capital in</text><text start="2038.679" dur="4.561">you know sort of the structure of a dow</text><text start="2041.08" dur="5.4">um you know so I think trying to find</text><text start="2043.24" dur="5.04">ways to defeat homogenization</text><text start="2046.48" dur="4.32">um and it&apos;s not just homogenization in</text><text start="2048.28" dur="4.139">terms of say capital I think uh you know</text><text start="2050.8" dur="4.68">you look at the histories of capitalism</text><text start="2052.419" dur="4.561">and slavery and capitalism evolve</text><text start="2055.48" dur="3.96">together uh that you know they they</text><text start="2056.98" dur="5.28">co-produced each other and I don&apos;t think</text><text start="2059.44" dur="4.26">it&apos;s an accident that uh the large</text><text start="2062.26" dur="3.839">majority of people in the world today</text><text start="2063.7" dur="4.439">who have the most Capital if you look at</text><text start="2066.099" dur="4.32">the CEOs of the boardrooms across the</text><text start="2068.139" dur="4.561">world they&apos;re mostly white to this day</text><text start="2070.419" dur="4.821">and I don&apos;t think that&apos;s an accident I</text><text start="2072.7" dur="6.06">you know and I think capital is a mirror</text><text start="2075.24" dur="5.58">of the values of those who have it and</text><text start="2078.76" dur="5.339">those who have more but get to project</text><text start="2080.82" dur="5.799">their vision of the world upon it and</text><text start="2084.099" dur="5.401">you know unfortunately then that becomes</text><text start="2086.619" dur="5.641">unsustainable it ends up you know really</text><text start="2089.5" dur="4.32">destroying the resource base and I think</text><text start="2092.26" dur="4.079">we need to think about the ways in which</text><text start="2093.82" dur="4.74">capital is white in our world it&apos;s part</text><text start="2096.339" dur="5.341">of the legacy of European colonialism</text><text start="2098.56" dur="5.82">and destruction and uh if you look at</text><text start="2101.68" dur="4.5">sort of a reproduction of the same that</text><text start="2104.38" dur="4.979">sort of brings everything into resonance</text><text start="2106.18" dur="6.32">with its structure and homogenizes and</text><text start="2109.359" dur="5.881">you know centralizes control uh you know</text><text start="2112.5" dur="4.78">biologically speaking it&apos;s it may be</text><text start="2115.24" dur="3.48">decentralized but it&apos;s still cancerous</text><text start="2117.28" dur="2.94">and so you look at the way cancer</text><text start="2118.72" dur="4.92">spreads throughout the body it&apos;s</text><text start="2120.22" dur="6.18">reproduction of the same yet it has this</text><text start="2123.64" dur="5.76">way of sort of threading into every</text><text start="2126.4" dur="4.92">aspect of a body uh in a way that is</text><text start="2129.4" dur="3.6">decentralized and that&apos;s the sort of</text><text start="2131.32" dur="4.08">thing that you know it&apos;s decentralized</text><text start="2133.0" dur="4.56">in the sense that it you know it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2135.4" dur="5.34">have a organizational Center but it has</text><text start="2137.56" dur="5.22">the same logic at work</text><text start="2140.74" dur="3.72">uh and so I think there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2142.78" dur="4.079">analogies between how cancer is</text><text start="2144.46" dur="4.56">structured and racial capitalism in our</text><text start="2146.859" dur="4.921">world today the world has woken up to</text><text start="2149.02"

start="2264.7" dur="3.72">about but also the this idea of the</text><text start="2266.98" dur="3.599">Matthew effect which is colloquially</text><text start="2268.42" dur="4.5">known as the rich get richer but it</text><text start="2270.579" dur="5.161">really is the compounding gains that</text><text start="2272.92" dur="4.86">come with any accumulated Capital uh so</text><text start="2275.74" dur="4.08">basically like the famous get more</text><text start="2277.78" dur="3.839">famous Kim Kardashian&apos;s audience is</text><text start="2279.82" dur="3.24">growing faster than mine because there&apos;s</text><text start="2281.619" dur="3.841">the compounding gains that come from</text><text start="2283.06" dur="5.039">that and over time this has led to</text><text start="2285.46" dur="4.86">economic systems that end in Revolution</text><text start="2288.099" dur="4.26">because the capital gets so concentrated</text><text start="2290.32" dur="5.279">you know in your example it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="2292.359" dur="5.881">Western uh sort of like upper middle</text><text start="2295.599" dur="5.821">class sorry upper upper class white</text><text start="2298.24" dur="6.24">people but um but like in generally</text><text start="2301.42" dur="5.46">their economic systems will tend to will</text><text start="2304.48" dur="4.02">tend to concentrate over time and to me</text><text start="2306.88" dur="4.08">the the mirror that I see there is with</text><text start="2308.5" dur="4.92">with cancer uh there&apos;s a coordination</text><text start="2310.96" dur="5.04">protocol around how cells divide in your</text><text start="2313.42" dur="4.56">in your your body and cells can just</text><text start="2316.0"

dur="4.62">sort of starts to eat the system it</text><text start="2327.7" dur="3.899">metastizes and it needs the system that</text><text start="2330.04" dur="3.12">it&apos;s in and so</text><text start="2331.599" dur="3.061">um it feels like to me there&apos;s a strong</text><text start="2333.16" dur="3.48">corollary between the coordination</text><text start="2334.66" dur="4.56">failure of

the</text><text start="2351.579" dur="5.161">the rich get richer kind of concept uh</text><text start="2354.7" dur="3.419">and and I think this is a false analogy</text><text start="2356.74"

you know</text><text start="2378.94" dur="3.659">the rich getting richer the more</text><text start="2380.32" dur="4.56">powerful getting more powerful I don&apos;t</text><text start="2382.599" dur="3.721">think that&apos;s necessarily bad in and of</text><text start="2384.88" dur="3.9">itself</text><text start="2386.32" dur="5.22">um I think where things become bad is</text><text start="2388.78" dur="5.16">where they&apos;re excluding uh other types</text><text start="2391.54" dur="4.559">of things uh and so if you look in the</text><text start="2393.94" dur="4.5">brain it&apos;s not just</text><text start="2396.099" dur="4.381">um reinforcement of the same there&apos;s</text><text start="2398.44" dur="3.72">also I mean the starting point of the</text><text start="2400.48" dur="4.619">brain is essentially</text><text start="2402.16" dur="5.459">in a massive disconnected mess of</text><text start="2405.099" dur="5.101">infancy uh your brain is just a</text><text start="2407.619" dur="4.801">hyper-connected hot mess of connections</text><text start="2410.2" dur="4.2">uh and that&apos;s part of what makes us able</text><text start="2412.42" dur="6.54">to learn like sponges when we&apos;re infants</text><text start="2414.4" dur="6.959">because everything is so near random</text><text start="2418.96" dur="3.84">um that you know all sorts of</text><text start="2421.359" dur="4.26">connections can come about and yes</text><text start="2422.8" dur="5.1">there&apos;s a pruning process where that</text><text start="2425.619" dur="4.74">which uh seems to work to the organism</text><text start="2427.9" dur="4.439">is reinforced and so reinforcement</text><text start="2430.359" dur="6.301">learning is kind of the way the brain</text><text start="2432.339" dur="6.721">functions but it also based on an</text><text start="2436.66" dur="6.12">incredibly random set of starting points</text><text start="2439.06" dur="6.24">and it&apos;s always multiple Pathways in the</text><text start="2442.78" dur="4.5">brain to accomplish anything uh you know</text><text start="2445.3" dur="4.14">I think people would tend to think that</text><text start="2447.28" dur="5.1">oh you&apos;ve got one section of your brain</text><text start="2449.44" dur="3.72">that does one thing or you know uh you</text><text start="2452.38" dur="2.88">know people used to talk about</text><text start="2453.16" dur="4.62">grandmother cells like there&apos;s one part</text><text start="2455.26" dur="4.38">of your brain where your grandma lives</text><text start="2457.78" dur="3.839">um and it&apos;s likely that there&apos;s several</text><text start="2459.64" dur="3.66">of those and they&apos;re slightly varied and</text><text start="2461.619" dur="3.72">they compete with each other and that&apos;s</text><text start="2463.3" dur="4.68">because everything in the brain is</text><text start="2465.339" dur="5.461">multiple and so you know this is where I</text><text start="2467.98" dur="5.22">think the rich get richer yes in society</text><text start="2470.8" dur="5.4">that&apos;s very often the case because we</text><text start="2473.2" dur="4.68">reinforce it yeah when we start thinking</text><text start="2476.2" dur="3.659">about cancer I think what makes cancer</text><text start="2477.88" dur="4.58">so dangerous is that it tends to be the</text><text start="2479.859" dur="5.641">same type of cell that just</text><text start="2482.46" dur="5.02">reproduces itself in a way that has</text><text start="2485.5" dur="4.92">nothing to do with the relationality to</text><text start="2487.48" dur="4.56">what&apos;s around it uh so these cells don&apos;t</text><text start="2490.42" dur="3.84">produce anything that&apos;s beneficial to</text><text start="2492.04" dur="5.1">the body but they just reproduce and</text><text start="2494.26" dur="4.44">copy the same over and over and over and</text><text start="2497.14" dur="3.9">that&apos;s where I think that the the</text><text start="2498.7" dur="4.919">feedback network of capital it&apos;s just</text><text start="2501.04" dur="4.5">more of the same for its own sake uh</text><text start="2503.619" dur="3.72">what I like about Dows is you know</text><text start="2505.54" dur="3.6">something you say in green pills is that</text><text start="2507.339" dur="3.661">we can now program our values into our</text><text start="2509.14" dur="3.18">money and that that&apos;s a you know a quote</text><text start="2511.0" dur="4.26">from you</text><text start="2512.32" dur="4.799">um I think that is fascinating</text><text start="2515.26" dur="5.04">um and I guess the question for me then</text><text start="2517.119" dur="6.601">becomes if we do program values into</text><text start="2520.3" dur="5.279">money uh and particularly uh values that</text><text start="2523.72" dur="4.2">produce public goods</text><text start="2525.579" dur="6.0">um how can we get people who are caught</text><text start="2527.92" dur="5.46">up in Legacy networks to want to become</text><text start="2531.579" dur="3.961">part of</text><text start="2533.38" dur="4.02">um yeah especially if those Legacy</text><text start="2535.54" dur="5.7">networks particularly of media and</text><text start="2537.4" dur="5.76">education are so uh destructive in their</text><text start="2541.24" dur="4.32">current setup how do we convince people</text><text start="2543.16" dur="4.14">to want to do public goods those are the</text><text start="2545.56" dur="4.26">sorts to think of</text><text start="2547.3" dur="4.799">yeah really great question</text><text start="2549.82" dur="3.779">um oh man there&apos;s there&apos;s there&apos;s so</text><text start="2552.099" dur="3.24">many Divergent thoughts happening in my</text><text start="2553.599" dur="3.061">brain but but we&apos;ll go with the most</text><text start="2555.339" dur="3.841">recent one because I have a small</text><text start="2556.66" dur="4.5">short-term memory uh so basically I I</text><text start="2559.18" dur="3.36">think that there&apos;s an opportunity to</text><text start="2561.16" dur="3.0">program our values and turn money in the</text><text start="2562.54" dur="4.92">space and and this is why by the way</text><text start="2564.16" dur="6.24">web3 is so hard to uh to process for</text><text start="2567.46" dur="5.04">people you know it&apos;s like um</text><text start="2570.4" dur="3.6">the old parable about the blind man and</text><text start="2572.5" dur="3.119">the Elephant where one of them feels it</text><text start="2574.0" dur="3.78">and they&apos;re like this is a Tusk and</text><text start="2575.619" dur="3.601">another feels the uh or the Tusk and</text><text start="2577.78" dur="3.539">they&apos;re like this is a spear and then</text><text start="2579.22" dur="3.3">the other one feels the leg and they&apos;re</text><text start="2581.319" dur="2.821">like oh this is a tree trunk and then</text><text start="2582.52" dur="6.18">the other one feels the tail and they&apos;re</text><text start="2584.14" dur="5.64">like this is a uh uh a string and and in</text><text start="2588.7" dur="2.28">some versions of the stories they even</text><text start="2589.78" dur="2.4">come to blow because they don&apos;t even</text><text start="2590.98" dur="2.879">agree that it&apos;s an elephant they&apos;re only</text><text start="2592.18" dur="3.419">seeing part of it and to me that&apos;s what</text><text start="2593.859" dur="3.661">what three feels like is like some</text><text start="2595.599" dur="3.301">people are like oh it&apos;s monkey jpegs and</text><text start="2597.52" dur="3.66">another person is like it&apos;s gonna</text><text start="2598.9" dur="3.48">revolutionize Finance because it&apos;s the</text><text start="2601.18" dur="2.88">internet of money and now we can send</text><text start="2602.38" dur="3.66">money across the computer network and</text><text start="2604.06" dur="4.86">then you have someone else who who says</text><text start="2606.04" dur="4.38">oh like I&apos;m the public goods guy and and</text><text start="2608.92" dur="3.6">and I think that like that&apos;s what makes</text><text start="2610.42" dur="3.659">it really hard to to grasp the the web</text><text start="2612.52" dur="3.48">through things but like if we can try to</text><text start="2614.079" dur="3.54">see the whole of the elephant it&apos;s that</text><text start="2616.0" dur="2.88">we have the internet of money and now we</text><text start="2617.619" dur="3.48">have open source money and we can</text><text start="2618.88" dur="4.02">program our values into our money and</text><text start="2621.099" dur="3.181">it&apos;s gonna be whatever our value systems</text><text start="2622.9" dur="4.199">are so for some people it&apos;ll be monkey</text><text start="2624.28" dur="5.64">jpegs and for some people it&apos;ll be</text><text start="2627.099" dur="4.74">public goods in like tokenized Hacky</text><text start="2629.92" dur="3.96">Sacks is like like something that has</text><text start="2631.839" dur="3.48">happened and this is the Boulder</text><text start="2633.88" dur="3.239">Colorado version of programming your</text><text start="2635.319" dur="4.141">values into your money but um but but</text><text start="2637.119" dur="3.841">anyway so I guess like the the sort of</text><text start="2639.46" dur="3.3">like prompt back to the audience is like</text><text start="2640.96" dur="3.78">when will X happen and the answer is</text><text start="2642.76" dur="4.859">when we build it and I think the key</text><text start="2644.74" dur="6.06">thing is to have that diversity of value</text><text start="2647.619" dur="5.641">systems and local currencies and</text><text start="2650.8" dur="4.38">coordination Technologies such that you</text><text start="2653.26" dur="4.68">don&apos;t like you get a monolith like the</text><text start="2655.18" dur="6.54">four criteria that you just mentioned uh</text><text start="2657.94" dur="5.76">diversity of of value systems in deep</text><text start="2661.72" dur="4.32">relationship with each other that are</text><text start="2663.7" dur="4.68">distributed and metastable like what is</text><text start="2666.04" dur="4.5">what is the Gestalt of all the values in</text><text start="2668.38" dur="3.479">web3 that can can bring It Forward I</text><text start="2670.54" dur="3.059">think is the systemic answer to your</text><text start="2671.859" dur="3.181">question of how we we bring people in</text><text start="2673.599" dur="4.74">and like maybe you&apos;ll come in because</text><text start="2675.04" dur="6.059">you you bought a uh an ape JPEG but</text><text start="2678.339" dur="4.141">you&apos;ll you&apos;ll stay because that uh board</text><text start="2681.099" dur="3.421">ape Yacht Club hopefully in the future</text><text start="2682.48" dur="3.66">uses get coin grants to do quadratic</text><text start="2684.52" dur="5.099">funding and now you&apos;re making more money</text><text start="2686.14" dur="5.459">off of uh working for for that than you</text><text start="2689.619" dur="3.181">were off of your leg job like I think</text><text start="2691.599" dur="3.0">there&apos;s a Tipping Point and there&apos;s</text><text start="2692.8" dur="3.539">going to be multiple tipping points so</text><text start="2694.599" dur="4.381">what does that bring up for you yeah</text><text start="2696.339" dur="5.101">well I mean I I think banking honestly</text><text start="2698.98" dur="4.56">is banking insecurities is where things</text><text start="2701.44" dur="3.36">are going really going to be impacted by</text><text start="2703.54" dur="2.819">yeah especially if you&apos;re not in the</text><text start="2704.8" dur="2.64">United States like there&apos;s parts of the</text><text start="2706.359" dur="4.441">world where you can&apos;t trust your local</text><text start="2707.44" dur="6.12">bank at all yeah yeah well I mean defy I</text><text start="2710.8" dur="5.58">mean all of a sudden anyone can become a</text><text start="2713.56" dur="5.7">micro lender then that is revolutionary</text><text start="2716.38" dur="5.64">because now the banks don&apos;t uh sort of</text><text start="2719.26" dur="5.099">have a lock on being loners right so</text><text start="2722.02" dur="5.4">anyone can loan</text><text start="2724.359" dur="6.24">um and you know cutting out the</text><text start="2727.42" dur="6.0">middlemen is just it&apos;s super easy once</text><text start="2730.599" dur="6.181">everything is tokenized I think the fact</text><text start="2733.42" dur="4.74">that Banks may go out of business as an</text><text start="2736.78" dur="4.44">industry</text><text start="2738.16" dur="5.64">that&apos;s insane to think through uh the</text><text start="2741.22" dur="4.98">fact that Securities will be almost</text><text start="2743.8" dur="4.799">impossible hopefully to forge that</text><text start="2746.2" dur="4.74">things like naked shorting and all the</text><text start="2748.599" dur="4.381">other sort of uh shenanigans that goes</text><text start="2750.94" dur="3.78">on that the SEC kind of turns a blind</text><text start="2752.98" dur="3.96">eye to</text><text start="2754.72" dur="3.96">um I mean I think Financial Industries</text><text start="2756.94" dur="3.84">as we know that will be radically</text><text start="2758.68" dur="4.86">transformed and sooner rather than later</text><text start="2760.78" dur="4.079">in terms of this technology uh it&apos;s just</text><text start="2763.54" dur="3.72">a matter of getting the protocols in</text><text start="2764.859" dur="3.48">place but I think there&apos;s you know uh</text><text start="2767.26" dur="2.64">you know I&apos;m looking at stuff like</text><text start="2768.339" dur="3.061">loopering level two and where that&apos;s</text><text start="2769.9" dur="4.919">been going</text><text start="2771.4" dur="4.679">um you know I think Defy is coming and I</text><text start="2774.819" dur="3.841">know that there are ways in which people</text><text start="2776.079" dur="5.701">have tried to produce uh sort of</text><text start="2778.66" dur="4.679">privatized versions of these things uh</text><text start="2781.78" dur="3.36">people have said like well will will</text><text start="2783.339" dur="3.361">there be fed coin and stuff like that</text><text start="2785.14" dur="4.62">it&apos;s like the internet to the internet</text><text start="2786.7" dur="5.879">back in when I was growing up yeah I</text><text start="2789.76" dur="4.14">mean I I think Finance is really where</text><text start="2792.579" dur="2.881">this is going to be absolutely</text><text start="2793.9" dur="4.62">disruptive</text><text start="2795.46" dur="4.68">um and potentially a good way one of the</text><text start="2798.52" dur="5.22">things I sort of think about is you know</text><text start="2800.14" dur="4.92">I I I I believe in this this industry uh</text><text start="2803.74" dur="3.54">as you do but like one of the things I</text><text start="2805.06" dur="3.96">think about having founded Bitcoin was</text><text start="2807.28" dur="3.12">that we just kind of fell ass backwards</text><text start="2809.02" dur="3.299">into an audience that understood</text><text start="2810.4" dur="4.5">transactions in metamask and private key</text><text start="2812.319" dur="6.54">management and so we&apos;re living our full</text><text start="2814.9" dur="6.0">best web3 life get coin uh because</text><text start="2818.859" dur="3.301">people understand how that last mile of</text><text start="2820.9" dur="3.959">how to interact with these applications</text><text start="2822.16" dur="4.8">but I wonder with defy if it&apos;s going to</text><text start="2824.859" dur="3.601">be more like a blockchain mullet where</text><text start="2826.96" dur="3.18">it&apos;s web 2 in the front and you don&apos;t</text><text start="2828.46" dur="3.18">have to learn any like it and it&apos;s what</text><text start="2830.14" dur="3.0">it&apos;s web3 in the back so like you don&apos;t</text><text start="2831.64" dur="4.14">have to learn anything about private Key</text><text start="2833.14" dur="4.32">Management transactions and installing</text><text start="2835.78" dur="3.18">browser extensions or anything like that</text><text start="2837.46" dur="2.639">and I think that that&apos;s one thing that&apos;s</text><text start="2838.96" dur="2.7">really</text><text start="2840.099" dur="3.661">you either either people are going to</text><text start="2841.66" dur="3.3">get educated to use these protocols or</text><text start="2843.76" dur="3.48">there&apos;s going to be things that look</text><text start="2844.96" dur="4.5">more like a Neo bank that that deploy</text><text start="2847.24" dur="5.22">them that&apos;s going to unleash the network</text><text start="2849.46" dur="4.26">ology of of Define web 3 for people well</text><text start="2852.46" dur="3.659">I think you know you look at the the</text><text start="2853.72" dur="4.619">iPhone and the Revolutionary cultural</text><text start="2856.119" dur="5.941">impact it had I mean I&apos;m still shocked</text><text start="2858.339" dur="5.701">that it&apos;s only 2007. right that that</text><text start="2862.06" dur="3.66">technology has only been around for a</text><text start="2864.04" dur="4.079">short period of time and yeah there were</text><text start="2865.72" dur="4.379">blackberries beforehand but I mean it</text><text start="2868.119" dur="3.72">was to some extent the fact that Steve</text><text start="2870.099" dur="3.181">Jobs made it</text><text start="2871.839" dur="3.361">um for you know for all the good and bad</text><text start="2873.28" dur="5.1">that he has done</text><text start="2875.2" dur="5.7">um he made it something that people</text><text start="2878.38" dur="4.38">could get in a very simple way and that</text><text start="2880.9" dur="5.459">led to mass adoption almost overnight</text><text start="2882.76" dur="6.0">because he did take all of this far more</text><text start="2886.359" dur="4.621">advanced stuff and package it in the</text><text start="2888.76" dur="4.859">older forms uh you know supposedly he</text><text start="2890.98" dur="4.619">walked around you know the offices uh</text><text start="2893.619" dur="4.381">when they were developing with a piece</text><text start="2895.599" dur="4.621">of wood that he kept in his shirt pocket</text><text start="2898.0" dur="3.18">and he&apos;s like I need it like this you</text><text start="2900.22" dur="3.0">know</text><text start="2901.18" dur="5.52">um and so I think technology tends to</text><text start="2903.22" dur="5.58">emerge in the skin of the old uh when</text><text start="2906.7" dur="4.02">when Cinema first came about people were</text><text start="2908.8" dur="3.539">just like oh it&apos;s like the theater and</text><text start="2910.72" dur="3.48">they were you know the very idea of a</text><text start="2912.339" dur="4.921">close-up was something that people had</text><text start="2914.2" dur="4.44">to think through and invent because they</text><text start="2917.26" dur="3.54">were just like wait we can cut this</text><text start="2918.64" dur="4.14">stuff we can paste it back together we</text><text start="2920.8" dur="4.319">could do close-up shots like the idea of</text><text start="2922.78" dur="4.74">different shots and editing that takes a</text><text start="2925.119" dur="4.321">good decade or so and I think web 3 is</text><text start="2927.52" dur="4.079">going to be the same way people are</text><text start="2929.44" dur="3.899">gonna have to develop new ways of</text><text start="2931.599" dur="3.301">thinking but I think when it starts it&apos;s</text><text start="2933.339" dur="3.541">going to

start="2939.4" dur="2.939">you know there&apos;s this idea of</text><text start="2940.42" dur="3.899">skiomorphism which is the the digital</text><text start="2942.339" dur="4.26">resembles the analog

start="2948.099" dur="2.581">which is to organize the world&apos;s</text><text start="2949.3" dur="3.6">information but Yahoo took the library</text><text start="2950.68" dur="3.84">card catalog system and put it on the</text><text start="2952.9" dur="2.82">internet and Google just invented a new</text><text start="2954.52" dur="3.9">form to interact with the information</text><text start="2955.72" dur="3.78">and you know the rest is history but</text><text start="2958.42" dur="3.54">like you know what what is the</text><text start="2959.5" dur="4.619">non-scheomorphic future of the network</text><text start="2961.96" dur="5.04">like can you take us there can you take</text><text start="2964.119" dur="4.921">us to 2035 and what kind of weird</text><text start="2967.0" dur="5.22">networkologies we&apos;re gonna see oh good</text><text start="2969.04" dur="5.039">lord well I mean can you can you help</text><text start="2972.22" dur="4.8">frame that question for me like like</text><text start="2974.079" dur="5.101">what where can you say the the what was</text><text start="2977.02" dur="3.72">it non-scheomorphic like non-skomorphic</text><text start="2979.18" dur="3.48">yeah yeah like what&apos;s Over the Horizon</text><text start="2980.74" dur="3.24">is the question I guess but it was just</text><text start="2982.66" dur="3.54">that you know you don&apos;t have a crystal</text><text start="2983.98" dur="4.619">ball so it&apos;s an unfair question but yeah</text><text start="2986.2" dur="5.639">I mean when you&apos;re looking at what&apos;s</text><text start="2988.599" dur="6.361">being done with evolutionary robotics</text><text start="2991.839" dur="5.28">um you know morphological computation uh</text><text start="2994.96" dur="4.98">you know all the stuff with new forms of</text><text start="2997.119" dur="5.041">AI that are linked into bodies that are</text><text start="2999.94" dur="4.139">linked into prediction algorithms and</text><text start="3002.16" dur="4.26">the weighting of those predictions as</text><text start="3004.079" dur="6.421">being more trustworthy less trustworthy</text><text start="3006.42" dur="6.06">uh I think self-assembling robots</text><text start="3010.5" dur="4.859">um robots that you know are sort of</text><text start="3012.48" dur="6.48">based on very simple little modules that</text><text start="3015.359" dur="5.281">then sort of evolve a social structure</text><text start="3018.96" dur="4.2">um to produce either bodies or</text><text start="3020.64" dur="5.1">communities of bodies like swarms on the</text><text start="3023.16" dur="5.159">Fly uh don&apos;t get me wrong I think it&apos;s</text><text start="3025.74" dur="4.079">not coming anytime soon but you know</text><text start="3028.319" dur="3.841">it&apos;s the sort of stuff if you look in</text><text start="3029.819" dur="6.661">the research uh the military would die</text><text start="3032.16" dur="7.08">for this stuff and so uh I I think the</text><text start="3036.48" dur="5.04">big question is how are networks and</text><text start="3039.24" dur="3.72">artificial intelligence uh how&apos;s that</text><text start="3041.52" dur="4.14">stuff going to start interacting with</text><text start="3042.96" dur="5.639">bodies in new ways and whether these be</text><text start="3045.66" dur="4.8">uh prosthesis you know things like uh</text><text start="3048.599" dur="3.0">augmentations and extensions of our</text><text start="3050.46" dur="2.82">bodies</text><text start="3051.599" dur="4.201">um what you know I I read somewhere that</text><text start="3053.28" dur="5.579">they just came out with the first</text><text start="3055.8" dur="5.759">um sort of hybrid organism type thing</text><text start="3058.859" dur="5.22">made of frog cells and AI that we&apos;re</text><text start="3061.559" dur="5.341">working together in various ways so I I</text><text start="3064.079" dur="5.161">think uh if we look at the future future</text><text start="3066.9" dur="5.34">we&apos;re talking about bodies uh you know</text><text start="3069.24" dur="5.7">we&apos;re talking about uh possibly things</text><text start="3072.24" dur="4.2">that you know might not even use silicon</text><text start="3074.94" dur="3.96">chips that are cereal in nature</text><text start="3076.44" dur="4.5">underneath the sort of uh Network</text><text start="3078.9" dur="3.84">structures that are you know you look at</text><text start="3080.94" dur="4.08">say artificial neural networks they&apos;re</text><text start="3082.74" dur="4.319">distributed on top but the underneath is</text><text start="3085.02" dur="4.14">a Serial chip</text><text start="3087.059" dur="4.321">um and you know if you can start to use</text><text start="3089.16" dur="4.439">molecules to do your Computing uh you</text><text start="3091.38" dur="4.199">know know but we&apos;re talking far in the</text><text start="3093.599" dur="4.201">Horizon for this sort of stuff</text><text start="3095.579" dur="4.321">um then you really cross an inflection</text><text start="3097.8" dur="4.559">point but you know these are the sorts</text><text start="3099.9" dur="3.959">of things that I&apos;m like you know</text><text start="3102.359" dur="4.021">people are actually working on some of</text><text start="3103.859" dur="4.681">this stuff and you don&apos;t know when they</text><text start="3106.38" dur="5.52">cross a you know a sort of boundary</text><text start="3108.54" dur="5.1">Point threshold yeah yeah so for you do</text><text start="3111.9" dur="4.38">you do you apply the lens of networks to</text><text start="3113.64" dur="4.56">this where basically the chip and the</text><text start="3116.28" dur="3.36">the cells are just both part of a</text><text start="3118.2" dur="3.3">network and they&apos;re speaking the same</text><text start="3119.64" dur="4.08">the same protocol but now there&apos;s sort</text><text start="3121.5" dur="4.44">of hybrid things that are enabled by the</text><text start="3123.72" dur="3.96">digital and and the biological</text><text start="3125.94" dur="3.54">um well I think it really comes down to</text><text start="3127.68" dur="3.12">what&apos;s the structure of the network you</text><text start="3129.48" dur="2.82">know you&apos;re saying the scientists will</text><text start="3130.8" dur="4.019">talk about the topology of the network</text><text start="3132.3" dur="5.88">right what&apos;s the shape is the shape</text><text start="3134.819" dur="5.881">centralized is it decentralized or yeah</text><text start="3138.18" dur="3.6">you know I I think more more Act is it</text><text start="3140.7" dur="4.5">distributed</text><text start="3141.78" dur="5.46">how is it distributed and is there a</text><text start="3145.2" dur="4.32">sort of sneaky level of centralization</text><text start="3147.24" dur="3.78">underneath uh you know and if we&apos;re</text><text start="3149.52" dur="3.38">talking computationally speaking we&apos;re</text><text start="3151.02" dur="4.02">talking about code or talking Hardware</text><text start="3152.9" dur="4.9">uh and then it&apos;s a question of access</text><text start="3155.04" dur="5.519">who has access to that who is the right</text><text start="3157.8" dur="5.519">change the protocols uh how is that</text><text start="3160.559" dur="4.381">negotiated uh these are the issues that</text><text start="3163.319" dur="4.381">I think really</text><text start="3164.94" dur="6.659">um determined on how</text><text start="3167.7" dur="6.24">how not only emergence but how fair a</text><text start="3171.599" dur="4.26">network is in certain ways so a network</text><text start="3173.94" dur="4.619">could be urgent like capitalism is</text><text start="3175.859" dur="4.681">emergent just in very restricted ways</text><text start="3178.559" dur="4.981">it&apos;s emergent the production of new</text><text start="3180.54" dur="5.579">products uh to give rise to more profits</text><text start="3183.54" dur="6.18">but that doesn&apos;t mean it leads to the</text><text start="3186.119" dur="6.0">types of qualitative emergences uh that</text><text start="3189.72" dur="5.22">could actually you know serve life</text><text start="3192.119" dur="4.2">beyond those sorts of things yeah you</text><text start="3194.94" dur="3.36">know where my mind goes is we talked</text><text start="3196.319" dur="4.621">about brains being reinforcement</text><text start="3198.3" dur="4.98">learning driven so basically you know if</text><text start="3200.94" dur="3.96">you give a mouse a cookie they get</text><text start="3203.28" dur="3.42">trained on you know that Sugar Rush that</text><text start="3204.9" dur="3.659">comes from that and and you know the</text><text start="3206.7" dur="3.659">argument that one that I that I&apos;ve heard</text><text start="3208.559" dur="3.601">is that capitalism as it exists right</text><text start="3210.359" dur="3.841">now is just a giant paper clip maximizer</text><text start="3212.16" dur="3.54">and and you know for people who don&apos;t</text><text start="3214.2" dur="3.6">get that analogy there&apos;s there&apos;s this</text><text start="3215.7" dur="3.899">thing about AIS which is like if you if</text><text start="3217.8" dur="4.08">you had an AI and you told it it needed</text><text start="3219.599" dur="3.601">to maximize the amount of paper clips on</text><text start="3221.88" dur="3.239">earth like At first it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="3223.2" dur="3.78">really efficient at producing a</text><text start="3225.119" dur="3.181">paperclip store on Amazon but then</text><text start="3226.98" dur="2.7">eventually it might turn the whole world</text><text start="3228.3" dur="2.819">into paper clips because it&apos;s just</text><text start="3229.68" dur="3.659">maximizing on that one heuristic and</text><text start="3231.119" dur="4.141">with capitalism the analogy here is that</text><text start="3233.339" dur="5.041">it turns the world into Financial profit</text><text start="3235.26" dur="4.5">uh price to earnings ratio and so you</text><text start="3238.38" dur="3.06">know I guess my question is how would</text><text start="3239.76" dur="5.099">you design a network that&apos;s designed</text><text start="3241.44" dur="5.04">around human thriving and</text><text start="3244.859" dur="5.22">um I don&apos;t know let&apos;s let&apos;s call it</text><text start="3246.48" dur="6.06">instead of a GDP uh gross domestic uh</text><text start="3250.079" dur="4.801">thriving or gross domestic lack of</text><text start="3252.54" dur="5.1">suffering uh more oriented around more</text><text start="3254.88" dur="4.38">human things as opposed to uh just</text><text start="3257.64" dur="3.36">profit you know but is there any way</text><text start="3259.26" dur="3.9">that you can apply a network or logical</text><text start="3261.0" dur="4.5">lens to to that kind of question</text><text start="3263.16" dur="4.98">well I I like how you put it that now we</text><text start="3265.5" dur="4.8">can program our values into our money uh</text><text start="3268.14" dur="5.219">you know and so like right now we&apos;ve got</text><text start="3270.3" dur="5.88">one type of sort of meat space token and</text><text start="3273.359" dur="5.521">that&apos;s you know a fiat currency produced</text><text start="3276.18" dur="6.54">by dollars yeah yeah</text><text start="3278.88" dur="6.54">um and those tend to you know be kept so</text><text start="3282.72" dur="5.16">abstract in terms of how they circulate</text><text start="3285.42" dur="4.679">that basically Whoever has the most gets</text><text start="3287.88" dur="4.439">to set the terms for the rest and that</text><text start="3290.099" dur="5.641">gets codified into laws and social norms</text><text start="3292.319" dur="5.181">and institutions uh and so I think web3</text><text start="3295.74" dur="4.319">is really a chance to start</text><text start="3297.5" dur="4.0">experimenting with new forms</text><text start="3300.059" dur="3.06">um that can lead to different types of</text><text start="3301.5" dur="4.079">Institutions</text><text start="3303.119" dur="6.661">um and that don&apos;t have to you know rely</text><text start="3305.579" dur="5.881">on Geographic uh nearness uh in order to</text><text start="3309.78" dur="3.059">really get off the ground so when we&apos;re</text><text start="3311.46" dur="3.0">talking about nation states you know</text><text start="3312.839" dur="4.26">everything relies on the fact that they</text><text start="3314.46" dur="4.56">share the same piece of territory but if</text><text start="3317.099" dur="3.96">you have you know like I think of things</text><text start="3319.02" dur="4.92">like you know man there&apos;s so many</text><text start="3321.059" dur="4.741">different types of debt in the world and</text><text start="3323.94" dur="3.6">their student loan debt there&apos;s housing</text><text start="3325.8" dur="4.5">debt there&apos;s Consumer Debt there&apos;s</text><text start="3327.54" dur="5.22">International debt between countries if</text><text start="3330.3" dur="4.14">all the debtors in the world which don&apos;t</text><text start="3332.76" dur="3.96">necessarily see themselves as having</text><text start="3334.44" dur="4.44">anything in common if they all started</text><text start="3336.72" dur="4.619">to see themselves as having something in</text><text start="3338.88" dur="4.56">common and forming unions and they</text><text start="3341.339" dur="4.921">decided to go on strike</text><text start="3343.44" dur="6.54">the entire global economy would grind to</text><text start="3346.26" dur="5.94">a halt and people could negotiate</text><text start="3349.98" dur="5.52">um you know better terms for their loans</text><text start="3352.2" dur="5.94">and actually make Capital change make</text><text start="3355.5" dur="4.079">the whole system change and that is</text><text start="3358.14" dur="5.82">something that</text><text start="3359.579" dur="6.421">could be facilitated by web3 but it&apos;s</text><text start="3363.96" dur="4.02">also just a change of mindset you know</text><text start="3366.0" dur="3.78">people who were you know we tend to</text><text start="3367.98" dur="4.56">think of debt as like oh if you owe</text><text start="3369.78" dur="4.44">money it&apos;s immoral but predatory lending</text><text start="3372.54" dur="5.16">is you know that&apos;s what created the</text><text start="3374.22" dur="5.16">whole 2008 crisis and so often is used</text><text start="3377.7" dur="3.96">to control and I think you know</text><text start="3379.38" dur="4.199">particularly with student loan debt we</text><text start="3381.66" dur="3.899">see the ways in which you can&apos;t do what</text><text start="3383.579" dur="4.861">you want to do after college if you take</text><text start="3385.559" dur="4.861">on debt because what you can do has to</text><text start="3388.44" dur="4.08">be centered around paying off those</text><text start="3390.42" dur="5.159">loans and so</text><text start="3392.52" dur="4.74">if we start seeing debt differently and</text><text start="3395.579" dur="3.121">we start seeing the systems and</text><text start="3397.26" dur="4.38">relations and start seeing money</text><text start="3398.7" dur="5.159">differently uh I think uh those sort of</text><text start="3401.64" dur="4.8">mindset changes they can be spurred by</text><text start="3403.859" dur="4.441">web3 they can be facilitated by web3 but</text><text start="3406.44" dur="3.72">I think some of the big battles that</text><text start="3408.3" dur="3.539">need to be fought are actually on the</text><text start="3410.16" dur="4.62">level of values in the very</text><text start="3411.839" dur="5.941">old-fashioned sense uh do we want a</text><text start="3414.78" dur="4.86">world that is centralized do we want a</text><text start="3417.78" dur="5.579">world in which a few people get to</text><text start="3419.64" dur="6.3">control things and I think you know web3</text><text start="3423.359" dur="4.321">may provide the technology for doing all</text><text start="3425.94" dur="3.54">sorts of different things but if we</text><text start="3427.68" dur="4.5">can&apos;t convince people to use that stuff</text><text start="3429.48" dur="5.639">and use it differently uh or if people</text><text start="3432.18" dur="4.74">don&apos;t start using it and then give rise</text><text start="3435.119" dur="2.94">to different results</text><text start="3436.92" dur="3.6">um we&apos;re going to end up in the same log</text><text start="3438.059" dur="4.861">jams and you know you look at say how</text><text start="3440.52" dur="5.339">facial recognition software uh was</text><text start="3442.92" dur="4.5">trained on such a limited data set and</text><text start="3445.859" dur="5.161">ended up only being able to then</text><text start="3447.42" dur="5.399">recognize largely the faces of uh white</text><text start="3451.02" dur="4.559">men of a certain age because that&apos;s is</text><text start="3452.819" dur="4.201">what was largely on the internet uh and</text><text start="3455.579" dur="3.661">like if you look at the data set that</text><text start="3457.02" dur="3.66">you know Google and Facebook used as</text><text start="3459.24" dur="4.2">they were developing these Technologies</text><text start="3460.68" dur="5.34">Facebook eventually used um labeled</text><text start="3463.44" dur="4.82">faces in the wild as their data set uh</text><text start="3466.02" dur="5.339">and they were you know some of the most</text><text start="3468.26" dur="4.54">commonly labeled faces available on the</text><text start="3471.359" dur="4.74">internet and they train their neural</text><text start="3472.8" dur="5.88">networks to identify them but it just so</text><text start="3476.099" dur="4.26">happened quote unquote that these were</text><text start="3478.68" dur="3.419">largely of white men of a certain age</text><text start="3480.359" dur="3.841">because those were the people who tended</text><text start="3482.099" dur="3.901">to get famous online</text><text start="3484.2" dur="3.48">um and so the networks were very bad at</text><text start="3486.0" dur="4.26">recognizing children people of color</text><text start="3487.68" dur="4.62">women older people</text><text start="3490.26" dur="4.559">um and that&apos;s where the biases of the</text><text start="3492.3" dur="4.799">data set got imported into the structure</text><text start="3494.819" dur="4.141">of the algorithm uh and I think we need</text><text start="3497.099" dur="4.561">to think about how those things happen</text><text start="3498.96" dur="5.58">and how they can happen as we develop</text><text start="3501.66" dur="5.159">these new technologies how can biases</text><text start="3504.54" dur="4.319">get imported in ways that we might even</text><text start="3506.819" dur="3.54">have difficulty recognizing until it&apos;s</text><text start="3508.859" dur="4.381">already baked in</text><text start="3510.359" dur="4.021">right yeah I mean I think that you know</text><text start="3513.24" dur="3.359">you just painted such a beautiful</text><text start="3514.38" dur="3.479">picture of of I think what could be</text><text start="3516.599" dur="4.02">built here and you know where my mind</text><text start="3517.859" dur="4.861">goes is that this is a feedback loop</text><text start="3520.619" dur="5.041">between change of self uh and change of</text><text start="3522.72" dur="4.5">systems and and so changing our values</text><text start="3525.66" dur="3.78">and building monetary systems around</text><text start="3527.22" dur="4.74">those values is not just a technology</text><text start="3529.44" dur="4.619">thing but it&apos;s also a cultural and</text><text start="3531.96" dur="4.74">experiential

emailed maybe a little bit about</text><text start="3544.26" dur="4.38">local currencies but you know in the</text><text start="3546.66" dur="3.899">world in which everything collapses to</text><text start="3548.64" dur="3.719">US dollars or everything it collapses to</text><text start="3550.559" dur="4.8">bitcoin you&apos;re going to get things that</text><text start="3552.359" dur="5.401">optimize for the value systems of of of</text><text start="3555.359" dur="4.381">of those networks and one of the things</text><text start="3557.76" dur="4.92">I&apos;m really kind of think is interesting</text><text start="3559.74" dur="5.7">about this decentralized modular</text><text start="3562.68" dur="4.919">ecosystem of web3 that&apos;s being built and</text><text start="3565.44" dur="3.419">some of the these these monetary systems</text><text start="3567.599" dur="3.781">are much smaller is that you could have</text><text start="3568.859" dur="5.581">a local currency around I don&apos;t know</text><text start="3571.38" dur="5.4">supporting downtown Boulder businesses</text><text start="3574.44" dur="6.24">you get a boulder coin you could have uh</text><text start="3576.78" dur="6.12">public goods coin you could have a regen</text><text start="3580.68" dur="4.86">coin and and and basically what this</text><text start="3582.9" dur="4.86">allows you to do is to have monetary</text><text start="3585.54" dur="4.86">systems that are equal to the value of</text><text start="3587.76" dur="4.14">the GDP of that monetary system they</text><text start="3590.4" dur="3.6">have that leverage against the global</text><text start="3591.9" dur="4.199">system but within them they&apos;re optimized</text><text start="3594.0" dur="4.16">around a certain value and and I&apos;m</text><text start="3596.099" dur="4.5">wondering if that might be a scalable</text><text start="3598.16" dur="3.939">architecture that has all those</text><text start="3600.599" dur="4.921">properties that we talked about earlier</text><text start="3602.099" dur="6.361">like you know the Gestalt of that is is</text><text start="3605.52" dur="5.64">uh diversity and distributed uh</text><text start="3608.46" dur="5.28">metastability that that allows for</text><text start="3611.16" dur="3.959">scaling of of more regeneration in the</text><text start="3613.74" dur="2.94">world so I know this is like a leading</text><text start="3615.119" dur="3.781">question but I got it but I guess I&apos;m</text><text start="3616.68" dur="5.76">just wondering uh</text><text start="3618.9" dur="5.58">how you view local currencies as as a</text><text start="3622.44" dur="3.899">pillar of this thing sure I mean I I</text><text start="3624.48" dur="5.099">would say as many currencies as there</text><text start="3626.339" dur="5.76">are locales uh you know why not it makes</text><text start="3629.579" dur="3.48">sense but not you know just I&apos;m sorry to</text><text start="3632.099" dur="2.341">interrupt I just want to interject like</text><text start="3633.059" dur="4.141">we&apos;re not talking about physical locales</text><text start="3634.44" dur="5.159">we&apos;re talking about uh dramatic locales</text><text start="3637.2" dur="4.98">also yeah absolutely it does not have to</text><text start="3639.599" dur="6.361">be physical locales um you know I think</text><text start="3642.18" dur="5.939">the what a token can be used for is wide</text><text start="3645.96" dur="4.379">open and will become wide open in ways</text><text start="3648.119" dur="4.141">it hadn&apos;t been before it makes me think</text><text start="3650.339" dur="4.5">of you know when people are like well</text><text start="3652.26" dur="5.099">what is the basic sort of</text><text start="3654.839" dur="4.141">um building block of society</text><text start="3657.359" dur="3.181">um and a lot of people would say if you</text><text start="3658.98" dur="3.839">look at a lot of societies around the</text><text start="3660.54" dur="4.14">world throughout history there&apos;s forms</text><text start="3662.819" dur="4.26">of ritual and there&apos;s forms of</text><text start="3664.68" dur="4.139">Storytelling around that and you produce</text><text start="3667.079" dur="4.381">artifacts when you produce rituals</text><text start="3668.819" dur="4.621">things like sacrifices and implements</text><text start="3671.46" dur="3.78">and altars and I&apos;m talking about you</text><text start="3673.44" dur="4.5">know back in the you know Mists of</text><text start="3675.24" dur="4.98">prehistory and you know where like what</text><text start="3677.94" dur="4.8">is it that brings group together and</text><text start="3680.22" dur="4.98">it&apos;s recognition of the importance of</text><text start="3682.74" dur="6.119">certain actions and so I think when you</text><text start="3685.2" dur="5.94">recognize a token as being of value uh</text><text start="3688.859" dur="3.841">that is a group that is saying yeah we</text><text start="3691.14" dur="4.74">all recognize that thing as being</text><text start="3692.7" dur="5.34">valuable and in accepting a token in</text><text start="3695.88" dur="4.26">giving a token you&apos;re reproducing a</text><text start="3698.04" dur="4.319">certain type of group uh and I think</text><text start="3700.14" dur="4.62">when we look at the ways in which uh</text><text start="3702.359" dur="4.74">sacrifices and rituals were done in the</text><text start="3704.76" dur="3.72">earliest parts of humanity</text><text start="3707.099" dur="3.0">um when we look at how myths were</text><text start="3708.48" dur="5.22">produced in relation to that I think</text><text start="3710.099" dur="6.0">there&apos;s a Continuum from that to uh you</text><text start="3713.7" dur="4.74">know the production of economies the</text><text start="3716.099" dur="4.2">production of languages uh where</text><text start="3718.44" dur="4.379">languages we tend to think of as the</text><text start="3720.299" dur="4.861">production of tokens that hold meanings</text><text start="3722.819" dur="5.641">uh and by tokens I mean everything from</text><text start="3725.16" dur="4.8">written words to spoken utterances uh</text><text start="3728.46" dur="3.18">you know if linguists will often refer</text><text start="3729.96" dur="3.839">to those as tokens</text><text start="3731.64" dur="4.5">um and so if you think of language and</text><text start="3733.799" dur="4.681">sort of monetary economies as two</text><text start="3736.14" dur="5.219">different types of token systems and you</text><text start="3738.48" dur="6.66">see those on a Continuum emerging from</text><text start="3741.359" dur="6.301">things like ritual and myth then the</text><text start="3745.14" dur="5.52">potentials for what tokens could become</text><text start="3747.66" dur="4.139">I think really opens up in certain ways</text><text start="3750.66" dur="3.54">and so when people start talking about</text><text start="3751.799" dur="4.921">you can use tokens not only to represent</text><text start="3754.2" dur="5.82">money type things but bundles of Rights</text><text start="3756.72" dur="4.74">identities social roles uh you know</text><text start="3760.02" dur="3.42">those who have a certain number of</text><text start="3761.46" dur="5.639">tokens get the right to vote in certain</text><text start="3763.44" dur="6.179">situations get the right to change the</text><text start="3767.099" dur="5.7">code in certain organizations I think</text><text start="3769.619" dur="5.101">the sky is the limit when a group when a</text><text start="3772.799" dur="3.661">group recognizes a token as having a</text><text start="3774.72" dur="4.139">certain function there&apos;s meaning and</text><text start="3776.46" dur="5.159">value there in regard to how that group</text><text start="3778.859" dur="6.061">understands itself and modulates its</text><text start="3781.619" dur="5.761">processes uh so I think what tokens can</text><text start="3784.92" dur="4.02">become is really open and I think we</text><text start="3787.38" dur="3.239">should start to think of it in these</text><text start="3788.94" dur="3.78">sorts of big terms</text><text start="3790.619" dur="3.96">yeah you know one of the we the things</text><text start="3792.72" dur="3.18">that I got out of the network ologies</text><text start="3794.579" dur="3.421">book is this idea of networks of</text><text start="3795.9" dur="3.659">networks and one of the things that sort</text><text start="3798.0" dur="3.9">of gets interesting for me is not just</text><text start="3799.559" dur="4.56">the internal consistency of how uh one</text><text start="3801.9" dur="4.26">of these local currency Networks</text><text start="3804.119" dur="3.541">works but also what is the Arbitrage</text><text start="3806.16" dur="3.12">between the local currency and the</text><text start="3807.66" dur="4.32">Global Currency you know if I&apos;ve got</text><text start="3809.28" dur="5.579">like I I don&apos;t I I don&apos;t know like</text><text start="3811.98" dur="4.56">tomato coin or um let&apos;s just call it</text><text start="3814.859" dur="3.48">public goods coin uh because that&apos;s</text><text start="3816.54" dur="4.68">that&apos;s a more internet native thing and</text><text start="3818.339" dur="6.02">I think a fit for ethereum is like does</text><text start="3821.22" dur="6.06">the how does that relate to the</text><text start="3824.359" dur="6.161">multi-trillion dollar Bitcoin slash U.S</text><text start="3827.28" dur="5.039">dollar Global hegemony coins it how are</text><text start="3830.52" dur="3.599">they are they valued in relation to each</text><text start="3832.319" dur="4.321">other how does how does one become</text><text start="3834.119" dur="4.561">bigger or smaller uh within the network</text><text start="3836.64" dur="4.32">of networks it is and it feels like to</text><text start="3838.68" dur="4.98">me the answer is the GDP of how many</text><text start="3840.96" dur="4.859">public goods or are coming out of public</text><text start="3843.66" dur="4.38">goods coin Dao or tomatoes are coming</text><text start="3845.819" dur="5.161">out of tomato Dow creates the demand</text><text start="3848.04" dur="4.74">from the global system into that local</text><text start="3850.98" dur="4.079">systems values and there&apos;s almost like</text><text start="3852.78" dur="3.539">an exchange rate between the two but</text><text start="3855.059" dur="3.54">there&apos;s there&apos;s kind of like a</text><text start="3856.319" dur="5.581">geopolitical game or whatever whatever</text><text start="3858.599" dur="4.74">Network a network political game because</text><text start="3861.9" dur="2.939">we&apos;re not using physical here between</text><text start="3863.339" dur="3.0">the local currency and the global</text><text start="3864.839" dur="3.601">currency in relation to how they&apos;re</text><text start="3866.339" dur="3.72">valued with each other and and I&apos;m</text><text start="3868.44" dur="3.119">wondering what other attributes of these</text><text start="3870.059" dur="3.3">networks inside of the networks that you</text><text start="3871.559" dur="3.421">that you kind of see here this this</text><text start="3873.359" dur="3.0">might be abstract and far out question</text><text start="3874.98" dur="3.42">I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re totally following</text><text start="3876.359" dur="3.24">but uh you know how do these networks</text><text start="3878.4" dur="2.52">embed in each other I guess is the</text><text start="3879.599" dur="2.941">question I&apos;m asking</text><text start="3880.92" dur="4.8">um I I mean if you look at the history</text><text start="3882.54" dur="5.46">of money uh and angst these sorts of</text><text start="3885.72" dur="4.44">issues were like they were huge you know</text><text start="3888.0" dur="5.339">like should the value of a coin be</text><text start="3890.16" dur="5.28">determined by the content of its gold uh</text><text start="3893.339" dur="5.52">the purity of its silver should it be</text><text start="3895.44" dur="4.919">determined by a completely floating uh</text><text start="3898.859" dur="3.361">you know set of exchanges</text><text start="3900.359" dur="3.361">internationally speaking so if you look</text><text start="3902.22" dur="3.42">in in regard to the bank of England</text><text start="3903.72" dur="5.28">there were these massive debates in the</text><text start="3905.64" dur="7.08">1600s between do we make the value of</text><text start="3909.0" dur="6.0">our currency equal to uh actual species</text><text start="3912.72" dur="4.859">actual you know blocks of silver and the</text><text start="3915.0" dur="4.5">weight of those or do we let the value</text><text start="3917.579" dur="5.101">float in relationship to international</text><text start="3919.5" dur="6.18">trade and other currencies and it wasn&apos;t</text><text start="3922.68" dur="4.919">really until the 19 well yeah I guess</text><text start="3925.68" dur="4.32">until the 19th century that you start</text><text start="3927.599" dur="5.101">seeing people sort of being like okay</text><text start="3930.0" dur="4.619">it&apos;s not really about the silver it&apos;s</text><text start="3932.7" dur="3.899">really about the social relationships</text><text start="3934.619" dur="4.68">and the the ways in which different</text><text start="3936.599" dur="5.941">countries value our currency and buy it</text><text start="3939.299" dur="5.161">and use it even though that was kind of</text><text start="3942.54" dur="4.92">the way things were for quite a while</text><text start="3944.46" dur="4.5">right so you know even though they kept</text><text start="3947.46" dur="3.839">saying like oh it&apos;s based in the silver</text><text start="3948.96" dur="3.899">oh it&apos;s based in the silver uh and so</text><text start="3951.299" dur="3.841">when you know when you see Nixon take</text><text start="3952.859" dur="4.681">things off the gold standard things had</text><text start="3955.14" dur="4.919">been going that way for you know</text><text start="3957.54" dur="5.16">hundreds of years you could say uh when</text><text start="3960.059" dur="5.461">it comes to uh different you know</text><text start="3962.7" dur="4.8">currencies exchanging off these sort of</text><text start="3965.52" dur="4.68">uh meta currencies we could think of it</text><text start="3967.5" dur="5.04">you know like US dollar is I mean it&apos;s a</text><text start="3970.2" dur="4.44">global Reserve currency at this point</text><text start="3972.54" dur="4.019">it&apos;s the the sort of meta money of the</text><text start="3974.64" dur="2.699">whole globe you could say</text><text start="3976.559" dur="3.3">um</text><text start="3977.339" dur="4.921">I think the problem is that when things</text><text start="3979.859" dur="3.661">freely exchange against something like</text><text start="3982.26" dur="3.779">that</text><text start="3983.52" dur="4.5">um very often the biggest kid on the</text><text start="3986.039" dur="5.161">Block gets to set the terms for all the</text><text start="3988.02" dur="5.16">others and I think there&apos;s so much that</text><text start="3991.2" dur="4.619">could be done with monetary policy where</text><text start="3993.18" dur="6.179">you pump money into the system using</text><text start="3995.819" dur="5.101">t-bills and Reserve uh Banking and I</text><text start="3999.359" dur="3.301">mean quantitative mechanisms</text><text start="4000.92" dur="3.3">quantitative easing and all that sort of</text><text start="4002.66" dur="4.199">stuff where I mean the fed&apos;s just been</text><text start="4004.22" dur="4.56">printing trillions of dollars and you</text><text start="4006.859" dur="3.421">know they used to sort of say when they</text><text start="4008.78" dur="3.42">were putting money into the economy now</text><text start="4010.28" dur="2.94">they have all these Sly methods of doing</text><text start="4012.2" dur="3.119">it</text><text start="4013.22" dur="3.599">um where people don&apos;t even know exactly</text><text start="4015.319" dur="2.961">how much money the fed&apos;s been slipping</text><text start="4016.819" dur="4.26">in you don&apos;t have to print it anymore</text><text start="4018.28" dur="5.2">you don&apos;t have to print it anymore it it</text><text start="4021.079" dur="4.381">you know you do it through reverse repo</text><text start="4023.48" dur="4.379">and stuff like that and you know this</text><text start="4025.46" dur="5.159">money just sort of slowly leaks into the</text><text start="4027.859" dur="4.381">economy in various ways uh and all they</text><text start="4030.619" dur="4.081">had to do was move some digits on a</text><text start="4032.24" dur="4.2">balance sheet uh I think if you&apos;re</text><text start="4034.7" dur="4.74">playing on a completely Level Playing</text><text start="4036.44" dur="5.82">Field with that stuff it will make your</text><text start="4039.44" dur="5.46">system uh take on aspects of whatever</text><text start="4042.26" dur="5.039">the most dominant system is and this is</text><text start="4044.9" dur="4.679">it gets the age-old question of like do</text><text start="4047.299" dur="5.04">you want to have protectionist barriers</text><text start="4049.579" dur="5.101">around your Dow in relationship to</text><text start="4052.339" dur="3.901">what&apos;s outside of it</text><text start="4054.68" dur="4.02">um and you know a lot of people say no</text><text start="4056.24" dur="4.799">we want you know free exchange but free</text><text start="4058.7" dur="4.919">exchange tends to let capitalism do its</text><text start="4061.039" dur="3.901">thing uh so I I think these are</text><text start="4063.619" dur="4.2">complicated questions</text><text start="4064.94" dur="5.34">yeah yeah for sure uh well hopefully the</text><text start="4067.819" dur="5.161">lens of networks and networkologies will</text><text start="4070.28" dur="3.96">be useful as we tackle these questions I</text><text start="4072.98" dur="4.2">know I certainly got a lot out of</text><text start="4074.24" dur="5.04">reading the networkologies book so</text><text start="4077.18" dur="3.3">um I think that at this point we should</text><text start="4079.28" dur="2.579">probably start converging towards</text><text start="4080.48" dur="3.18">wrapping up this conversation or</text><text start="4081.859" dur="4.081">although it&apos;s been immense and and</text><text start="4083.66" dur="3.72">beautiful and diverse uh in its own way</text><text start="4085.94" dur="3.3">so</text><text start="4087.38" dur="3.12">um first point for the listeners is get</text><text start="4089.24" dur="3.059">the network allergies book there&apos;ll be a</text><text start="4090.5" dur="3.9">link in the show notes but it seems like</text><text start="4092.299" dur="3.9">you&apos;re working on a on a sequel or at</text><text start="4094.4" dur="4.08">least several sequels so tell me where</text><text start="4096.199" dur="3.841">you&apos;re taking this yeah I mean it&apos;s kind</text><text start="4098.48" dur="4.14">of hard for me to work on one project at</text><text start="4100.04" dur="4.98">a time so I&apos;ve I&apos;ve got several books</text><text start="4102.62" dur="4.32">that are just sort of networking out in</text><text start="4105.02" dur="3.9">separate directions and I&apos;m I&apos;m working</text><text start="4106.94" dur="4.379">to keep them all on the same page even</text><text start="4108.92" dur="4.379">as they grow in different ways and so</text><text start="4111.319" dur="4.561">the the probably the first book that I</text><text start="4113.299" dur="5.821">hope will hit the market is um one</text><text start="4115.88" dur="5.1">that&apos;s about neuroscience and uh the</text><text start="4119.12" dur="5.76">ways in which artificial neural networks</text><text start="4120.98"
