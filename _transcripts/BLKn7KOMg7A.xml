start="96.659" dur="2.82">Punk and that&apos;s why I wanted to do an</text><text start="97.86" dur="3.54">episode on it I wanted to see where</text><text start="99.479" dur="5.221">could we synthesize solar pumpkin lunar</text><text start="101.4" dur="5.88">Punk and how is the two communities</text><text start="104.7" dur="4.62">building in the same direction versus in</text><text start="107.28"

dur="6.48">uh sustainability energy technology and</text><text start="410.94" dur="5.699">the organic it&apos;s really focused in the</text><text start="413.58" dur="6.72">collectivism also focusing

dur="3.959">imagines</text><text start="424.62" dur="3.96">um how the future can be using let&apos;s say</text><text start="427.139" dur="5.221">green Energies</text><text start="428.58" dur="5.7">and also it&apos;s imagining a world</text><text start="432.36" dur="7.619">um that is uh collaborating in different</text><text start="434.28" dur="7.44">social ideas and access because uh of uh</text><text start="439.979" dur="3.901">let&apos;s say because of what we&apos;re</text><text start="441.72" dur="5.46">currently living with the late stage</text><text start="443.88" dur="5.28">capitalism and yeah the solar pump</text><text start="447.18" dur="5.16">movement believes that humanity and</text><text start="449.16" dur="5.3">nature can Thrive together and we can</text><text start="452.34" dur="6.12">coexist and basically create</text><text start="454.46" dur="6.28">environments that includes everyone</text><text start="458.46" dur="5.579">um the solar Punk movement also offers</text><text start="460.74" dur="6.959">uh uh positive and kind of like a</text><text start="464.039" dur="6.481">optimistic view of the world and and</text><text start="467.699" dur="5.761">yeah that&apos;s that&apos;s basically the summary</text><text start="470.52" dur="7.26">of what solar Point means to me</text><text start="473.46" dur="5.639">amazing uh Rose uh you&apos;ve published or I</text><text start="477.78" dur="4.02">think people that you are associated</text><text start="479.099" dur="4.741">with darkfi have published a video about</text><text start="481.8" dur="4.56">lunar Punk and the dark side of the</text><text start="483.84" dur="5.4">cycle which I think defines lunar punk</text><text start="486.36" dur="5.1">as a aesthetic movement and in an</text><text start="489.24" dur="4.079">ideology and also</text><text start="491.46" dur="3.12">um I guess has some criticisms of solar</text><text start="493.319" dur="4.041">Punk and I&apos;m wondering if you can unpack</text><text start="494.58" dur="2.78">those for us here</text><text start="498.599" dur="4.5">definitely</text><text start="500.099" dur="5.341">um so you know on Southern punk I just</text><text start="503.099" dur="3.78">want to briefly comment um that you know</text><text start="505.44" dur="4.439">there&apos;s something there&apos;s a reason why</text><text start="506.879" dur="7.861">we as dark fight have started to kind of</text><text start="509.879" dur="7.141">tap into the um the punk uh uh uh meme</text><text start="514.74" dur="3.359">Plex and it&apos;s because that I think</text><text start="517.02" dur="2.399">there&apos;s something very valuable</text><text start="518.099" dur="3.481">happening</text><text start="519.419" dur="5.341">um in the emergence of the certain Punk</text><text start="521.58" dur="6.66">meme within ethereum and web3 which is</text><text start="524.76" dur="7.92">uh I see it as an effort of the Ethereal</text><text start="528.24" dur="5.76">Community to define a vision uh for</text><text start="532.68" dur="3.54">where they&apos;re going and where they want</text><text start="534.0" dur="3.66">to go within their with their software</text><text start="536.22" dur="4.86">so I think that&apos;s a really positive</text><text start="537.66" dur="7.859">thing it&apos;s a it&apos;s a bottom-up emergent</text><text start="541.08" dur="6.9">um ideology or or set of practices that</text><text start="545.519" dur="4.5">is motivating uh ethereum and providing</text><text start="547.98" dur="3.84">it with the um with the direction which</text><text start="550.019" dur="5.461">I think is really valuable</text><text start="551.82" dur="5.4">um so where lunar Funk comes in is um</text><text start="555.48" dur="3.0">it&apos;s basically it&apos;s something that I&apos;ve</text><text start="557.22" dur="5.04">been thinking about for a number of</text><text start="558.48" dur="6.299">years because in 2018 I was uh going to</text><text start="562.26" dur="5.46">a lot of ethereum conferences I was the</text><text start="564.779" dur="4.261">uh the the lead uh ethereum writer for</text><text start="567.72" dur="4.739">coindesk</text><text start="569.04" dur="6.66">and I became increasingly</text><text start="572.459" dur="6.421">um disturbed by the emphasis on</text><text start="575.7" dur="5.579">transparency which you know is is seen</text><text start="578.88" dur="4.5">as a solar Punk principle</text><text start="581.279" dur="4.68">that underpins a lot of the design</text><text start="583.38" dur="4.98">choices meaning you know there&apos;s a</text><text start="585.959" dur="5.401">there&apos;s a emphasis and an effort to make</text><text start="588.36" dur="5.82">transparent systems uh within the solar</text><text start="591.36" dur="4.26">pump uh within the sort of book design</text><text start="594.18" dur="3.599">Paradigm</text><text start="595.62" dur="4.92">um so I saw a lot of this at the eat</text><text start="597.779" dur="5.041">conferences but I found that it was</text><text start="600.54" dur="5.1">became very difficult to distinguish</text><text start="602.82" dur="4.98">between uh things that are transparent</text><text start="605.64" dur="5.639">for</text><text start="607.8" dur="7.26">um reasons like let&apos;s coordinate around</text><text start="611.279" dur="6.541">social goods in a way that&apos;s uh that can</text><text start="615.06" dur="4.98">hold people accountable and and another</text><text start="617.82" dur="6.0">kind of transparency which is very</text><text start="620.04" dur="6.84">prevalent in a big Tech which is you</text><text start="623.82" dur="6.3">know surveillance so these two kind of</text><text start="626.88" dur="4.44">Tendencies of Technology the tendency of</text><text start="630.12" dur="3.54">transparency in the surveillance</text><text start="631.32" dur="3.9">tendency we&apos;re combining themselves in</text><text start="633.66" dur="3.84">ethereum</text><text start="635.22"

from</text><text start="642.66" dur="4.739">privacy and anonymity and putting the</text><text start="645.18" dur="4.8">the emphasis on scaling you know it&apos;s a</text><text start="647.399" dur="6.18">common uh mistake but ethereum made it</text><text start="649.98" dur="6.299">as well and um it&apos;s had these huge uh</text><text start="653.579" dur="4.981">ramifications on the kind of tools that</text><text start="656.279" dur="5.401">are used on ethereum and it also means</text><text start="658.56" dur="5.399">that even if ethereum is solar Punk and</text><text start="661.68" dur="4.92">it has these ideological Tendencies you</text><text start="663.959" dur="4.62">know it has Good Will and it wants to do</text><text start="666.6" dur="5.22">something positive for society even if</text><text start="668.579" dur="6.481">it has those intentions the the fact the</text><text start="671.82" dur="5.22">reality of the software it&apos;s making is</text><text start="675.06"

the</text><text start="682.38" dur="4.019">surveillance State and system uh so</text><text start="685.14" dur="4.439">that&apos;s that&apos;s something that really</text><text start="686.399" dur="4.861">bothered me very early on uh in my</text><text start="689.579" dur="3.661">interaction with ethereum</text><text start="691.26" dur="5.94">uh so people were defining themselves a</text><text start="693.24" dur="7.2">soda punk I said you know uh that lunar</text><text start="697.2" dur="6.06">Punk is a much better framework uh and</text><text start="700.44" dur="5.459">so you know and that&apos;s that&apos;s kind of</text><text start="703.26" dur="5.04">where where we where we&apos;re coming from</text><text start="705.899" dur="4.261">um and it was then in the in the last</text><text start="708.3" dur="5.46">year or so that I that I started to</text><text start="710.16" dur="5.52">write the uh write these ideas but lunar</text><text start="713.76" dur="4.199">Punk is an existing</text><text start="715.68" dur="5.7">um oh sorry I&apos;ll let Manny talk but</text><text start="717.959" dur="6.301">lunar Park gets existed for uh before</text><text start="721.38" dur="5.28">you know this article I I didn&apos;t</text><text start="724.26" dur="4.44">um arrive at it by myself although I did</text><text start="726.66" dur="5.1">arrive in it independently of the other</text><text start="728.7" dur="5.16">uh kind of sides to lunar Punk so I</text><text start="731.76" dur="3.84">would say my my version of lunar Punk is</text><text start="733.86" dur="3.84">quite singular</text><text start="735.6" dur="3.419">um and it&apos;s quite specific</text><text start="737.7" dur="3.48">um but we can talk a little bit about</text><text start="739.019" dur="4.44">what is that version versus the other</text><text start="741.18" dur="4.52">versions but I&apos;ll let uh Manu uh chime</text><text start="743.459" dur="2.241">in</text><text start="746.7" dur="4.74">yeah I just wanted to say that um the</text><text start="749.579" dur="4.801">idea that solar Punk is only focusing</text><text start="751.44" dur="5.1">transparency and it&apos;s I think it&apos;s just</text><text start="754.38" dur="4.32">a narrative that is being used to create</text><text start="756.54" dur="4.979">this separation with this between these</text><text start="758.7" dur="5.939">two two groups I personally haven&apos;t seen</text><text start="761.519" dur="6.0">anywhere uh that it says that solar</text><text start="764.639" dur="4.741">punks are not are not</text><text start="767.519" dur="6.06">um are not let&apos;s say a group of people</text><text start="769.38" dur="7.5">that care about privacy I myself have</text><text start="773.579" dur="6.901">been cutting myself a solar Punk uh</text><text start="776.88" dur="5.699">based on the optimism side and not based</text><text start="780.48" dur="3.659">on if something is private or not</text><text start="782.579" dur="3.601">private</text><text start="784.139" dur="3.541">um and I&apos;m saying it as a Venezuelan</text><text start="786.18" dur="3.959">that used to fight the government back</text><text start="787.68" dur="4.98">in Venezuela and I had to have my myself</text><text start="790.139" dur="4.801">because the world government was you</text><text start="792.66" dur="4.799">know spying on WhatsApp and spying on</text><text start="794.94" dur="5.82">all the different social media apps</text><text start="797.459" dur="5.82">um so yeah I think uh I think uh is is</text><text start="800.76" dur="5.46">uh is currently more a narrative than</text><text start="803.279" dur="6.06">than the reality of what solar punks are</text><text start="806.22" dur="6.359">I think but maybe I&apos;m calling myself</text><text start="809.339" dur="7.161">solar pump without knowing uh the whole</text><text start="812.579" dur="3.921">definition of the solar Punk then</text><text start="817.26" dur="4.5">I would say that I think that you know</text><text start="819.18" dur="4.56">we&apos;re all it&apos;s it&apos;s hard to it&apos;s very</text><text start="821.76" dur="4.139">reductionist to try to collapse a lot of</text><text start="823.74" dur="4.26">these memes down into one words and</text><text start="825.899" dur="3.24">maybe they mean or one word each and</text><text start="828.0" dur="3.6">maybe they mean different things to</text><text start="829.139" dur="5.76">different people but I do think that um</text><text start="831.6" dur="6.06">you know ethereum and Bitcoin having uh</text><text start="834.899" dur="4.921">transparency at the base layer and ZK</text><text start="837.66" dur="4.2">technology sort of being developed on</text><text start="839.82" dur="4.98">top of these things but only in an</text><text start="841.86" dur="6.779">opt-in basis has maybe been what&apos;s been</text><text start="844.8" dur="7.08">the real driving wedge of what uh</text><text start="848.639" dur="5.461">uh of the differences between the two</text><text start="851.88" dur="3.48">and you know uh Rachel Rose I&apos;m</text><text start="854.1" dur="2.7">wondering if we could go into your work</text><text start="855.36" dur="3.12">at darkfi and it seems like you&apos;re</text><text start="856.8" dur="4.5">building a layer one that has privacy</text><text start="858.48" dur="4.26">baked in at the base layer I I hopefully</text><text start="861.3" dur="2.76">I didn&apos;t misstate that but I&apos;m I&apos;m</text><text start="862.74" dur="2.58">curious if you think that&apos;s the wedge</text><text start="864.06" dur="4.459">and and tell us about what you&apos;re</text><text start="865.32" dur="3.199">building with darkfi</text><text start="868.74" dur="2.539">absolutely and</text><text start="874.44" dur="5.28">it&apos;s in Venezuela as being something</text><text start="877.079" dur="4.681">which uh made him conscious of the</text><text start="879.72" dur="4.02">importance of privacy and because I do</text><text start="881.76" dur="4.319">think that this is an aspect and you</text><text start="883.74" dur="4.68">know don&apos;t see this as an attack against</text><text start="886.079" dur="6.241">soda Punk necessarily but perhaps it is</text><text start="888.42" dur="5.4">an attack on ethereum where you know I I</text><text start="892.32" dur="4.459">do think that there&apos;s a lot of people in</text><text start="893.82" dur="5.16">ethereum who forget the Privacy aspect</text><text start="896.779" dur="4.18">deprioritize it</text><text start="898.98" dur="4.979">um and it&apos;s because they haven&apos;t had</text><text start="900.959" dur="5.82">those life experiences uh in you know</text><text start="903.959" dur="5.401">conflict scenarios or at war with the</text><text start="906.779" dur="5.221">government that have led them to you</text><text start="909.36" dur="5.099">know realize that that the Privacy is</text><text start="912.0" dur="4.86">actually something that&apos;s essential to</text><text start="914.459" dur="4.68">um you know to safety and survival</text><text start="916.86" dur="4.8">something very very key</text><text start="919.139" dur="5.281">um but uh in terms of dark fight yeah so</text><text start="921.66" dur="6.0">so you know you made this uh remark</text><text start="924.42" dur="5.159">Kevin which I think is good about the</text><text start="927.66" dur="4.859">um the</text><text start="929.579" dur="4.981">um basis of the solar-prong systems such</text><text start="932.519" dur="4.32">as ethereum and Bitcoin as being a</text><text start="934.56" dur="6.6">transparent layer and then having opt-in</text><text start="936.839" dur="7.141">ZK uh infrastructure on top of us and so</text><text start="941.16" dur="5.94">what the I would say the lunar Punk</text><text start="943.98" dur="5.7">um design choice is to have</text><text start="947.1" dur="3.599">uh anonymity and privacy at the base</text><text start="949.68" dur="2.779">layer</text><text start="950.699" dur="5.521">and then having</text><text start="952.459" dur="6.281">transparency as an optional thing that</text><text start="956.22" dur="4.979">can be configured in extreme cases where</text><text start="958.74" dur="4.14">transparency is considered necessary but</text><text start="961.199" dur="3.481">it&apos;s not the default it&apos;s like an</text><text start="962.88" dur="4.079">extreme case</text><text start="964.68" dur="5.04">um so I think that&apos;s a really important</text><text start="966.959" dur="4.74">distinction I see it as a correction of</text><text start="969.72" dur="4.799">the current Paradigm because it used to</text><text start="971.699" dur="5.82">be believed that uh this this this</text><text start="974.519" dur="6.421">Paradigm of transparent-based layer ZK</text><text start="977.519" dur="5.82">uh kind of sub layers or you know layer</text><text start="980.94" dur="4.8">twos Etc but this would be that this</text><text start="983.339" dur="5.0">would work but you know since tornado</text><text start="985.74" dur="6.12">cash we&apos;ve seen that if you have</text><text start="988.339" dur="6.581">Anonymous systems oh no if you have</text><text start="991.86" dur="5.159">Anonymous systems uh tacked on top of</text><text start="994.92" dur="4.74">transparent systems</text><text start="997.019" dur="4.201">um it&apos;s a it&apos;s a recipe for censorship</text><text start="999.66" dur="4.08">issues</text><text start="1001.22" dur="5.28">um so on ethereum you can censor those</text><text start="1003.74" dur="5.279">contracts on a layer two currently</text><text start="1006.5" dur="5.519">they&apos;re all using centralized sequences</text><text start="1009.019" dur="5.82">which means that at any activity on the</text><text start="1012.019" dur="6.0">layer 2 if it&apos;s Anonymous can be easily</text><text start="1014.839" dur="5.041">censored by the sequencer or you know in</text><text start="1018.019" dur="4.38">the same way as a center to Nato cache</text><text start="1019.88" dur="5.1">by censoring the the contract so that</text><text start="1022.399" dur="5.701">that&apos;s that&apos;s uh that&apos;s why darkfi is</text><text start="1024.98" dur="5.579">taking the approach of of anonymous uh</text><text start="1028.1" dur="4.979">base layer optional privacy in the</text><text start="1030.559" dur="4.561">extreme case I I just want to say also</text><text start="1033.079" dur="4.441">the flag I really wanted to show you</text><text start="1035.12" dur="5.64">guys is comment them on the women&apos;s</text><text start="1037.52" dur="5.22">Association which for in the uh Irish</text><text start="1040.76" dur="5.579">Independence Movement</text><text start="1042.74" dur="5.339">um back in the 20s but yeah go on</text><text start="1046.339" dur="3.061">beautiful</text><text start="1048.079" dur="3.781">um I I&apos;m wondering if we could actually</text><text start="1049.4" dur="5.58">talk about some object level examples of</text><text start="1051.86" dur="4.8">where privacy is important I think that</text><text start="1054.98" dur="4.68">might be important to ground The</text><text start="1056.66" dur="4.32">Listener in something relatable and and</text><text start="1059.66" dur="4.56">I think that you each have your own</text><text start="1060.98" dur="4.8">version of that so maybe we start start</text><text start="1064.22" dur="3.06">with you</text><text start="1065.78" dur="4.32">yeah sure</text><text start="1067.28" dur="5.58">um something private</text><text start="1070.1" dur="5.459">um is something that you don&apos;t want to</text><text start="1072.86" dur="3.36">make it public to the whole world</text><text start="1075.559" dur="2.781">um</text><text start="1076.22" dur="5.1">and it doesn&apos;t mean that he&apos;s secret</text><text start="1078.34" dur="6.219">secret means that you don&apos;t want anyone</text><text start="1081.32" dur="5.34">to know of it uh something private uh</text><text start="1084.559" dur="5.641">would be for example the communication</text><text start="1086.66" dur="6.66">that I was having with my uh my friends</text><text start="1090.2" dur="5.099">when we were let&apos;s say</text><text start="1093.32" dur="3.9">um creating some protests against the</text><text start="1095.299" dur="4.5">government back in Venezuela we will</text><text start="1097.22" dur="4.74">communicate in a private manner uh some</text><text start="1099.799" dur="4.981">of my friends they had</text><text start="1101.96" dur="4.62">um radios for airplanes</text><text start="1104.78" dur="3.42">um so we would use those radios for</text><text start="1106.58" dur="4.86">airplanes in different frequencies to</text><text start="1108.2" dur="5.16">communicate between us uh in in town</text><text start="1111.44" dur="4.68">because uh we knew where the police was</text><text start="1113.36" dur="5.28">coming and where the let&apos;s say the uh</text><text start="1116.12" dur="3.6">National Guard was coming and attacking</text><text start="1118.64" dur="2.82">us</text><text start="1119.72" dur="5.52">um at the very beginning when we started</text><text start="1121.46" dur="5.94">protesting it was let&apos;s say very uh very</text><text start="1125.24" dur="4.559">peaceful only with</text><text start="1127.4" dur="4.38">um only with writings uh you know</text><text start="1129.799" dur="4.5">claiming what we wanted</text><text start="1131.78" dur="6.3">um but then it started to become more</text><text start="1134.299" dur="5.521">and more dangerous like the first time</text><text start="1138.08" dur="4.02">um you know it was peaceful the second</text><text start="1139.82" dur="5.34">time the police or the National Guard</text><text start="1142.1" dur="5.52">came and started shutting uh shooting a</text><text start="1145.16" dur="4.56">Ruger rubber bullets at us the third</text><text start="1147.62" dur="5.16">time you&apos;re kind of like already</text><text start="1149.72" dur="5.819">prepared the fourth time you are already</text><text start="1152.78" dur="4.5">communicating between uh the people that</text><text start="1155.539" dur="3.541">you consider</text><text start="1157.28" dur="5.279">um consider let&apos;s say a language your</text><text start="1159.08" dur="6.9">values so in that specific scenario we</text><text start="1162.559" dur="5.161">were using privacy and not secrecy</text><text start="1165.98" dur="3.24">um we were using a privacy in order to</text><text start="1167.72" dur="4.44">protect ourselves against the government</text><text start="1169.22" dur="5.16">and against let&apos;s say Force</text><text start="1172.16" dur="4.44">um so yeah that was let&apos;s say an example</text><text start="1174.38" dur="5.7">of how we use</text><text start="1176.6" dur="5.76">um let&apos;s say private networks to</text><text start="1180.08" dur="4.2">communicate between us in order to</text><text start="1182.36" dur="3.96">coordinate and in order to protect</text><text start="1184.28" dur="4.32">ourselves as well</text><text start="1186.32" dur="4.64">um and when I say to coordinate I would</text><text start="1188.6" dur="5.579">say I would say in order to let&apos;s say</text><text start="1190.96" dur="7.36">decide where we were going to be</text><text start="1194.179" dur="6.661">um protesting at what time and how we</text><text start="1198.32" dur="5.099">were going to be dressed of what signals</text><text start="1200.84" dur="5.94">we were going to be using having on top</text><text start="1203.419" dur="6.241">of us in order to show to the uh to the</text><text start="1206.78" dur="6.3">same side of our of our team that we</text><text start="1209.66" dur="7.259">were uh that we were part of them</text><text start="1213.08" dur="7.32">um so yeah I think uh privacy can be</text><text start="1216.919" dur="6.961">used in order to protect but also in</text><text start="1220.4" dur="6.48">order to strategize uh against uh</text><text start="1223.88" dur="4.38">against those that are let&apos;s say using</text><text start="1226.88" dur="4.32">Force</text><text start="1228.26" dur="6.36">um using Force to impose their views and</text><text start="1231.2" dur="5.339">impose uh impose their uh their loss</text><text start="1234.62" dur="4.32">let&apos;s say</text><text start="1236.539" dur="6.241">um in the digital space</text><text start="1238.94" dur="6.18">um we were also trying to use private</text><text start="1242.78" dur="5.22">um let&apos;s say private channels to</text><text start="1245.12" dur="4.919">communicate but most of it uh was</text><text start="1248.0" dur="4.08">related to communication and not really</text><text start="1250.039" dur="4.5">not related to transactions because at</text><text start="1252.08" dur="4.62">the time uh there was no blockchains</text><text start="1254.539" dur="4.741">there was nothing like that</text><text start="1256.7" dur="4.5">um but yeah there&apos;s there&apos;s more</text><text start="1259.28" dur="5.04">um there&apos;s more things that I&apos;m starting</text><text start="1261.2" dur="7.68">to identify why privacy is also</text><text start="1264.32" dur="6.96">important at the transaction uh layer</text><text start="1268.88" dur="4.919">and we can see it with what happened</text><text start="1271.28" dur="5.279">with uh let&apos;s say</text><text start="1273.799" dur="4.561">um with tornado cash for example there&apos;s</text><text start="1276.559" dur="4.381">a lot of people that are using tornado</text><text start="1278.36" dur="4.74">cash for good reasons in order to</text><text start="1280.94" dur="5.46">protect themselves in order to protect</text><text start="1283.1" dur="5.22">uh also their families and in order to</text><text start="1286.4" dur="2.6">let&apos;s say</text><text start="1288.32" dur="4.2">um</text><text start="1289.0" dur="4.96">transact without having someone spying</text><text start="1292.52" dur="5.159">on them</text><text start="1293.96" dur="6.36">um but also there is the other side uh</text><text start="1297.679" dur="5.521">that is uh you know which is most of the</text><text start="1300.32" dur="5.479">most of the let&apos;s say narrative that is</text><text start="1303.2" dur="6.479">being used which is that is being used</text><text start="1305.799" dur="6.101">uh for laundry money and so on but then</text><text start="1309.679" dur="4.86">the people that are saying this these</text><text start="1311.9" dur="4.38">type of things they forget like what are</text><text start="1314.539" dur="3.181">the currencies that are being used for</text><text start="1316.28" dur="3.72">doing that</text><text start="1317.72" dur="4.98">um US dollar is the currency that is</text><text start="1320.0" dur="5.4">being used the most for transacting with</text><text start="1322.7" dur="4.08">drugs for human trafficking and for all</text><text

dur="5.759">um that&apos;s that&apos;s my perspective</text><text start="1332.299" dur="4.921">thanks so much Manu uh Rose would love</text><text start="1335.659" dur="3.301">to hear examples of where you think</text><text start="1337.22" dur="3.42">privacy is important it may be obvious</text><text start="1338.96" dur="3.54">but I would love to just get them out</text><text start="1340.64" dur="2.58">there so that the audience can relate to</text><text start="1342.5" dur="2.82">them</text><text start="1343.22" dur="3.78">before I go into the to the concrete</text><text start="1345.32" dur="5.94">example I just wanted to talk a little</text><text start="1347.0" dur="8.36">bit about how privacy is framed by</text><text start="1351.26" dur="6.62">um these communities and I think</text><text start="1355.36" dur="6.699">especially from The Cypher Community</text><text start="1357.88" dur="7.72">it&apos;s often framed in a negative sense as</text><text start="1362.059" dur="6.181">that it&apos;s a it protects you you it&apos;s a</text><text start="1365.6" dur="5.22">freedom from coerce</text><text start="1368.24" dur="5.4">that are violence from the state so</text><text start="1370.82" dur="8.04">privacy enables that I would say see</text><text start="1373.64" dur="8.7">privacy in a positive affirmative sense</text><text start="1378.86" dur="6.9">that privacy is what enables people to</text><text start="1382.34" dur="6.12">Define their own Destinies so it enables</text><text start="1385.76" dur="6.18">political self-determination</text><text start="1388.46" dur="8.28">and uh you know so to illustrate that</text><text start="1391.94" dur="7.32">point uh in 2019 and I spent some time</text><text start="1396.74" dur="7.62">in Syria in in the north of Syria the</text><text start="1399.26" dur="9.0">Kurdish region uh where is the rojava</text><text start="1404.36" dur="5.58">revolution which is a experiment in</text><text start="1408.26" dur="5.12">building a</text><text start="1409.94" dur="6.3">Society without any kind of nation-state</text><text start="1413.38" dur="6.4">and it was inspired by the writings of</text><text start="1416.24" dur="5.7">Abdullah that</text><text start="1419.78" dur="5.16">is a writer who&apos;s heavily influenced</text><text start="1421.94" dur="5.16">lunar punk in various capacities</text><text start="1424.94" dur="3.359">um so rajaba was an interesting example</text><text start="1427.1" dur="3.42">because</text><text start="1428.299" dur="4.681">it&apos;s a place where there&apos;s very poor</text><text start="1430.52" dur="5.899">privacy so</text><text start="1432.98" dur="6.6">um the communication systems</text><text start="1436.419" dur="5.861">are go through enemy territories</text><text start="1439.58" dur="5.459">so there&apos;s a there&apos;s unencrypted data</text><text start="1442.28" dur="4.379">cables that pass through various enemy</text><text start="1445.039" dur="4.101">territories that can be easily</text><text start="1446.659" dur="7.02">intercepted so from a communication</text><text start="1449.14" dur="8.919">standpoint the Privacy is very weak from</text><text start="1453.679" dur="6.901">a financial standpoint the Privacy is</text><text start="1458.059" dur="4.321">not too bad it&apos;s an agricultural region</text><text start="1460.58" dur="5.4">historically very subjugated they don&apos;t</text><text start="1462.38" dur="6.9">have any banks what they do have is uh a</text><text start="1465.98" dur="5.28">system of trust-based credit</text><text start="1469.28" dur="3.72">um called the Valhalla Network where</text><text start="1471.26" dur="4.2">that you can use to send cash around</text><text start="1473.0" dur="4.919">pretty anonymously</text><text start="1475.46" dur="4.62">um so it&apos;s interesting because while I</text><text start="1477.919" dur="4.321">was there we were discussing with people</text><text start="1480.08" dur="4.14">uh to bring cryptocurrency to that</text><text start="1482.24" dur="4.02">region because philosophically</text><text start="1484.22" dur="4.5">ideologically there&apos;s a lot of alignment</text><text start="1486.26" dur="5.34">but we were faced with the fact that um</text><text start="1488.72" dur="6.42">in cryptocurrency today and the use of</text><text start="1491.6" dur="5.4">those systems would actually bring</text><text start="1495.14" dur="4.74">um you know would actually</text><text start="1497.0" dur="4.5">uh reduce the overall Financial privacy</text><text start="1499.88" dur="6.0">of the people</text><text start="1501.5" dur="6.659">um so you know all that to say that I I</text><text start="1505.88" dur="4.44">think that privacy is essential because</text><text start="1508.159" dur="5.701">of the fact that it&apos;s what</text><text start="1510.32" dur="5.099">um it enables a big degree it enables</text><text start="1513.86" dur="4.14">sovereignty</text><text start="1515.419" dur="5.281">and autonomy I actually believe that</text><text start="1518.0" dur="4.08">sovereignty is impossible in a state of</text><text start="1520.7" dur="3.66">surveillance</text><text start="1522.08" dur="5.16">um because surveillance is what it</text><text start="1524.36" dur="5.819">removes our capacity to implement our</text><text start="1527.24" dur="6.179">own moral and political Destinies which</text><text start="1530.179" dur="7.561">is to say our our ability to determine</text><text start="1533.419" dur="7.681">our own politics so privacy is is a</text><text start="1537.74" dur="7.319">necessary precondition for that</text><text start="1541.1" dur="6.6">um but you know in in our in our current</text><text start="1545.059" dur="5.281">um kind of blockchain Paradigm we</text><text start="1547.7" dur="5.339">haven&apos;t we haven&apos;t built that in and so</text><text start="1550.34" dur="5.699">the the systems that we do have they</text><text start="1553.039" dur="5.88">expose their participants and they mean</text><text start="1556.039"

dur="5.559">the space of activity that they can take</text><text start="1571.179" dur="8.081">uh earlier this</text><text start="1573.919" dur="7.321">year we raised uh 50 million to as

dur="6.239">necessary uh and available that was our</text><text start="1586.58" dur="5.28">core mission statement however uh we</text><text start="1590.179" dur="4.141">raised all this money and because of the</text><text start="1591.86" dur="4.74">fact that we are on ethereum and all of</text><text start="1594.32" dur="3.78">the actions of the devil is known and</text><text start="1596.6"

dur="3.721">storing it away in the state so that&apos;s</text><text start="2030.58" dur="3.9">the definition of the of the state that</text><text start="2032.26" dur="4.019">leader poems have and lunarbronics are</text><text start="2034.48" dur="5.1">also very interested in what we call</text><text start="2036.279" dur="4.981">moral political society which is the</text><text start="2039.58" dur="4.62">kind of societies that we can create</text><text start="2041.26" dur="5.399">outside the state which is what lunar</text><text start="2044.2" dur="4.8">punks refer to as the external</text><text start="2046.659" dur="5.161">orientation of lunar Punk so you know</text><text start="2049.0" dur="5.82">lunar punks our symbol is the moon this</text><text start="2051.82" dur="6.18">is a uh you know something outside our</text><text start="2054.82" dur="6.559">frame of reference it has like uh</text><text start="2058.0" dur="5.879">um uh a external</text><text start="2061.379" dur="5.98">Celestial quality</text><text start="2063.879" dur="5.401">and so the this is very core to the</text><text start="2067.359" dur="4.32">lunar Punk framework because it&apos;s about</text><text start="2069.28" dur="5.579">how do we how do we</text><text start="2071.679" dur="5.761">um use speculation and tactics like</text><text start="2074.859" dur="5.24">speculation to</text><text start="2077.44" dur="5.88">um navigate our way towards an outside</text><text start="2080.099" dur="5.26">beyond the restrictive framework placed</text><text start="2083.32" dur="3.24">on us by state-based civilization so</text><text start="2085.359" dur="3.181">that&apos;s why we have science fiction</text><text start="2086.56" dur="4.98">that&apos;s why we have you know this kind of</text><text start="2088.54" dur="6.839">alien uh inhabitants because the alien</text><text start="2091.54" dur="6.299">is a symbol of trying to bypass that uh</text><text start="2095.379" dur="5.761">that that cultural impasse whereas</text><text start="2097.839" dur="4.681">with solar Punk and you know I I think</text><text start="2101.14" dur="2.82">that the issue</text><text start="2102.52" dur="3.9">you know the core issue that I have in</text><text start="2103.96" dur="4.68">Solo Punk is that it hasn&apos;t properly it</text><text start="2106.42" dur="3.84">doesn&apos;t share the same analysis that we</text><text start="2108.64" dur="5.28">have as the inner products of the state</text><text start="2110.26" dur="6.24">so it risks replicating state-based</text><text start="2113.92" dur="5.4">society and state-based behaviors inside</text><text start="2116.5" dur="5.04">of its systems so one evidence of that</text><text start="2119.32" dur="4.56">would be like you know let&apos;s let&apos;s make</text><text start="2121.54" dur="4.62">everything transparent for example but</text><text start="2123.88" dur="5.82">also more deeply you know the emphasis</text><text start="2126.16" dur="6.06">on on the sun uh the sun historically</text><text start="2129.7" dur="6.0">has always been a symbol of domination</text><text start="2132.22" dur="5.94">you know of of of Monopoly</text><text start="2135.7" dur="5.78">um you just like for example think of</text><text start="2138.16" dur="7.02">the coincidence between polytheism</text><text start="2141.48" dur="6.22">uh and and and decentralized uh</text><text start="2145.18" dur="5.82">environments like forests</text><text start="2147.7" dur="5.22">um oceans mountains uh so so you know</text><text start="2151.0" dur="4.859">there&apos;s a kind of a Confluence between</text><text start="2152.92" dur="5.82">geography and spirituality where we see</text><text start="2155.859" dur="4.921">more political societies emerging in</text><text start="2158.74" dur="4.44">these Landscapes with diverse terrains</text><text start="2160.78" dur="4.98">whereas monotheism is something that</text><text start="2163.18" dur="5.1">emerges in a desert landscape so it&apos;s</text><text start="2165.76" dur="5.76">this it&apos;s this it&apos;s this kind of</text><text start="2168.28" dur="5.52">um combination a collision of like the</text><text start="2171.52" dur="4.559">desert and God and man and like</text><text start="2173.8" dur="4.559">submission to God</text><text start="2176.079" dur="4.921">um so so I see that</text><text start="2178.359" dur="5.041">for for me there&apos;s an evidence that</text><text start="2181.0" dur="4.079">solar Punk hasn&apos;t fully uh it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2183.4" dur="3.66">share our analysis it doesn&apos;t share our</text><text start="2185.079" dur="4.5">critique of the state and the evidence</text><text start="2187.06" dur="4.86">of this is in its relationship to the</text><text start="2189.579" dur="4.741">Sun that it upholds as a central symbol</text><text start="2191.92" dur="3.48">yeah I think that uh a lot of people</text><text start="2194.32" dur="4.68">don&apos;t</text><text start="2195.4" dur="6.54">don&apos;t know what a state means uh because</text><text start="2199.0" dur="5.04">they haven&apos;t experienced it themselves</text><text start="2201.94" dur="5.58">um and it&apos;s because lack of knowledge</text><text start="2204.04" dur="5.94">rather than they want the state</text><text start="2207.52" dur="5.339">um but it&apos;s more lack of knowledge in my</text><text start="2209.98" dur="5.22">perspective uh also in my humble opinion</text><text start="2212.859" dur="5.401">I I think that</text><text start="2215.2" dur="6.36">um that the sun is not necessarily just</text><text start="2218.26" dur="5.4">a symbol of totalitarianism</text><text start="2221.56" dur="3.799">um as you mentioned</text><text start="2223.66" dur="4.679">um as you mentioned</text><text start="2225.359" dur="5.801">polytheism within the Aztecs and the</text><text start="2228.339" dur="4.74">Mayans they actually use the Sun as a</text><text start="2231.16" dur="3.48">form of God but they had also multiple</text><text start="2233.079" dur="4.26">forms of God</text><text start="2234.64" dur="4.74">um so I think that we cannot completely</text><text start="2237.339" dur="3.961">say that one thing is blight or why</text><text start="2239.38" dur="3.42">completely it&apos;s just a spectrum and we</text><text start="2241.3" dur="2.94">just need to find ourselves within the</text><text start="2242.8" dur="4.44">Spectrum</text><text start="2244.24" dur="7.02">um but that&apos;s again my personal opinion</text><text start="2247.24" dur="5.28">yeah I I I I agree and I think that</text><text start="2251.26" dur="3.3">there&apos;s</text><text start="2252.52" dur="4.38">um you know someone made the point of</text><text start="2254.56" dur="5.039">one of the discussions that uh that</text><text start="2256.9" dur="4.98">solar lunar punk are like two aspects of</text><text start="2259.599" dur="4.921">the one mind and I do think that there&apos;s</text><text start="2261.88" dur="6.12">something very essential and integral</text><text start="2264.52" dur="6.54">about uh dualism you know like these two</text><text start="2268.0" dur="5.82">if you look at ancient Egyptian myth</text><text start="2271.06" dur="4.32">there&apos;s a uh often gods they have</text><text start="2273.82" dur="3.96">counterparts you know so if you&apos;ve got</text><text start="2275.38" dur="4.02">one God you always have a counterpart</text><text start="2277.78" dur="3.36">um to kind of balance it out so there&apos;s</text><text start="2279.4" dur="4.26">like balance and Harmony was considered</text><text start="2281.14" dur="6.0">like the the important thing and and if</text><text start="2283.66" dur="5.82">and also in Psychology this has a big uh</text><text start="2287.14" dur="5.1">resonance because you know one</text><text start="2289.48" dur="4.92">definition of of Madness is when the</text><text start="2292.24" dur="5.76">Mind goes like too far down one extreme</text><text start="2294.4" dur="5.16">and it loses its counterbalance and and</text><text start="2298.0" dur="3.54">so the other side of the mind which has</text><text start="2299.56" dur="4.08">been which has been forgotten takes over</text><text start="2301.54" dur="4.5">and it becomes and the mind descends</text><text start="2303.64" dur="4.16">into madness and I and I do see that um</text><text start="2306.04" dur="5.579">you know the kind of the lunar Punk</text><text start="2307.8" dur="6.039">Insurrection inside of ethereum now as</text><text start="2311.619" dur="4.861">like a form of psychosis that&apos;s</text><text start="2313.839" dur="5.101">overwhelming the the kind of mean Plex</text><text start="2316.48" dur="4.619">because of the fact that the solar punks</text><text start="2318.94" dur="3.26">have gone too far in One Direction you</text><text start="2321.099" dur="4.561">know and</text><text start="2322.2" dur="6.28">they&apos;ve missed they&apos;ve lost touch with</text><text start="2325.66" dur="5.459">them with this counterbalance in the</text><text start="2328.48" dur="4.68">form of like of privacy but not just</text><text start="2331.119" dur="4.74">privacy but the lunar Punk disposition</text><text start="2333.16" dur="5.1">which in general you know which is more</text><text start="2335.859" dur="5.041">kind of attuned to the reality of</text><text start="2338.26" dur="4.8">conflict uh you know it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="2340.9" dur="5.58">more inherently revolutionary I would</text><text start="2343.06" dur="5.16">say uh it&apos;s it&apos;s more willing to</text><text start="2346.48" dur="4.02">um but again to say you know I say</text><text start="2348.22" dur="4.5">revolutionary the lunar Punk is defined</text><text start="2350.5" dur="5.94">uh the kind of the Revolutionary</text><text start="2352.72" dur="6.42">activity as restoring uh the moral and</text><text start="2356.44" dur="3.48">political fabric of society</text><text start="2359.14" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="2359.92" dur="5.84">so uh restoring the social Fabric and</text><text start="2362.98" dur="2.78">the social nature</text><text start="2365.8" dur="3.42">um that&apos;s that&apos;s that&apos;s what I&apos;ll say</text><text start="2368.26" dur="3.359">about that</text><text start="2369.22" dur="6.0">go ahead man I think that that&apos;s the</text><text start="2371.619" dur="6.121">probably the the difference between uh</text><text start="2375.22" dur="6.78">let&apos;s say what I consider lunar Punk and</text><text start="2377.74" dur="6.599">solar Punk uh and why is because uh</text><text start="2382.0" dur="5.28">there is like this conflict between</text><text start="2384.339" dur="5.941">these two ideas</text><text start="2387.28" dur="5.04">um but in in the in as you said in the</text><text start="2390.28" dur="4.44">lunar punk you see yourself as a more as</text><text start="2392.32" dur="5.34">a revolutionary and I personally see</text><text start="2394.72" dur="5.399">myself as a more as a evolutionary type</text><text start="2397.66" dur="4.919">of person because I believe that uh</text><text start="2400.119" dur="6.48">Revolution means conflict means fight</text><text start="2402.579" dur="5.161">means uh Means War means all of that and</text><text start="2406.599" dur="3.061">I don&apos;t want to live in a world like</text><text start="2407.74" dur="5.4">that because I have already experienced</text><text start="2409.66" dur="6.84">that and it&apos;s it&apos;s really nasty it&apos;s</text><text start="2413.14" dur="7.439">really uh it doesn&apos;t put first humans it</text><text start="2416.5" dur="7.68">puts first ideas uh against humans</text><text start="2420.579" dur="6.801">um so yeah to me uh the let&apos;s say the</text><text start="2424.18" dur="8.159">solar Punk type of uh experience is more</text><text start="2427.38" dur="7.84">uh evolutionary more guided to evolve</text><text start="2432.339" dur="4.381">and and yeah not necessarily create</text><text start="2435.22" dur="5.66">conflict</text><text start="2436.72" dur="4.16">I just wanted to say that like I I</text><text start="2441.16" dur="5.82">it was apparent and you know is a</text><text start="2444.099" dur="6.721">terrible thing and there&apos;s there&apos;s you</text><text start="2446.98" dur="6.78">know very little good about war but</text><text start="2450.82" dur="5.16">um the the distinction I would make is I</text><text start="2453.76" dur="6.24">would say that we are already in in war</text><text start="2455.98" dur="7.32">we are already at War and Society at</text><text start="2460.0" dur="6.359">large is under siege</text><text start="2463.3" dur="4.86">um and unfortunately you know we&apos;re this</text><text start="2466.359" dur="3.781">this is the issue that I have with a lot</text><text start="2468.16" dur="3.959">of crypto is that we&apos;re we&apos;re very</text><text start="2470.14" dur="3.479">sheltered from this in the west and I</text><text start="2472.119" dur="3.541">think a lot of the people who interact</text><text start="2473.619" dur="4.5">with crypto are very sheltered from this</text><text start="2475.66" dur="4.26">but actually the world is in a state of</text><text start="2478.119" dur="4.021">War it&apos;s in a state of Crisis and a</text><text start="2479.92" dur="4.38">state of conflict so you know for me</text><text start="2482.14" dur="6.959">it&apos;s not enough to</text><text start="2484.3" dur="7.2">um simply will it to improve uh you know</text><text start="2489.099" dur="4.141">as and and even actually</text><text start="2491.5" dur="3.18">you know so it&apos;s not enough to Willard</text><text start="2493.24" dur="3.9">to improve</text><text start="2494.68" dur="4.38">um we we have to uh take we have to</text><text start="2497.14" dur="6.0">consciously engage with this but also</text><text start="2499.06" dur="7.559">Evolution I just wanted to to remark is</text><text start="2503.14" dur="5.939">a violent process evolution is not a</text><text start="2506.619" dur="4.921">gradual Continuum but something that</text><text start="2509.079" dur="5.941">happens in fits and bursts</text><text start="2511.54" dur="5.76">um punctuated equilibria uh so even</text><text start="2515.02" dur="3.92">Evolution itself is is in a state of</text><text start="2517.3" dur="5.4">conflict</text><text start="2518.94" dur="5.2">I agree that we are in a state of let&apos;s</text><text start="2522.7" dur="2.04">say War</text><text start="2524.14" dur="3.719">um</text><text start="2524.74" dur="5.879">in in a world right now</text><text start="2527.859" dur="4.561">um but what I what I wanted to say or</text><text start="2530.619" dur="4.321">what I was saying before is that I don&apos;t</text><text start="2532.42" dur="6.54">want to leave uh I don&apos;t want to leave</text><text start="2534.94" dur="7.26">my daily life in a state of mind of War</text><text start="2538.96" dur="6.18">um why because I have already lit that</text><text start="2542.2" dur="5.76">and it&apos;s not healthy at least for myself</text><text start="2545.14" dur="4.8">and I&apos;m not saying that the people</text><text start="2547.96" dur="4.74">shouldn&apos;t be doing it or people</text><text start="2549.94" dur="6.48">shouldn&apos;t be thinking about it but for</text><text start="2552.7" dur="6.3">my own uh let&apos;s say well-being I cannot</text><text start="2556.42" dur="6.06">be in a state of mind where I&apos;m only</text><text start="2559.0" dur="6.359">focusing focusing my attention in war</text><text start="2562.48" dur="7.619">um I want to focus my attention in other</text><text start="2565.359" dur="7.74">aspects like love like compassion and we</text><text start="2570.099" dur="5.781">have seen let&apos;s say uh different</text><text start="2573.099" dur="7.321">different let&apos;s say</text><text start="2575.88" dur="6.58">activists in the world that have used uh</text><text start="2580.42" dur="4.679">conflict</text><text start="2582.46" dur="6.96">um and that have used let&apos;s say peace as</text><text start="2585.099" dur="7.26">a form of as a form of uh protest and we</text><text start="2589.42" dur="7.439">have seen like that that is possible to</text><text start="2592.359" dur="9.421">also uh resolve our problems using love</text><text start="2596.859" dur="8.521">and using uh using let&apos;s say peace</text><text start="2601.78" dur="6.66">um and actually elevating people to a</text><text start="2605.38" dur="7.02">higher conscious Consciousness level</text><text start="2608.44" dur="8.04">um I that&apos;s my personal opinion and I</text><text start="2612.4" dur="8.04">personally have uh seen that it works uh</text><text start="2616.48" dur="7.2">that it can work but it requires a lot a</text><text start="2620.44" dur="4.919">lot of uh work and a lot of uh let&apos;s say</text><text start="2623.68" dur="5.88">willingness to</text><text start="2625.359" dur="5.941">to not uh to not let let&apos;s say the</text><text start="2629.56" dur="4.86">forces</text><text start="2631.3" dur="5.96">um basically make you what you are</text><text start="2634.42" dur="2.84">trying to fight against</text><text start="2637.9" dur="3.9">um so like I there&apos;s something I</text><text start="2640.24" dur="2.579">definitely agree with you on there which</text><text start="2641.8" dur="2.76">is about</text><text start="2642.819" dur="4.26">um so you know I describe the current</text><text start="2644.56" dur="3.72">situation as society as being in a state</text><text start="2647.079" dur="3.061">of War</text><text start="2648.28" dur="4.5">and you said I don&apos;t want to live like</text><text start="2650.14" dur="5.34">mentally in a state of war and I think</text><text start="2652.78" dur="5.76">that&apos;s a good point because you know uh</text><text start="2655.48" dur="6.3">I&apos;ve also lived in in in in war-like</text><text start="2658.54" dur="5.1">scenarios like when I was in rajava uh</text><text start="2661.78" dur="4.38">we were waiting the reason why I went</text><text start="2663.64" dur="3.78">over was because erdogan said he was</text><text start="2666.16" dur="4.08">going to invade</text><text start="2667.42" dur="6.24">and this was different to at the time</text><text start="2670.24" dur="5.579">Kurds had been at war with ISIS</text><text start="2673.66" dur="3.78">um and and rajava had been gaining a lot</text><text start="2675.819" dur="4.201">of territory it had been mostly winning</text><text start="2677.44" dur="6.24">the war against Isis a very different</text><text start="2680.02" dur="6.059">kind of War though in between like</text><text start="2683.68" dur="5.58">um a like asymmetric Warfare with a</text><text start="2686.079" dur="4.5">gorilla Army like Isis and the kind of</text><text start="2689.26" dur="3.0">war that you would have against a</text><text start="2690.579" dur="4.02">nation-state like turkey</text><text start="2692.26" dur="3.72">so erdogan was saying he&apos;s going to come</text><text start="2694.599" dur="3.901">in he&apos;s going to fill the sky with</text><text start="2695.98" dur="5.339">drones turkey has the most advanced uh</text><text start="2698.5" dur="5.28">drone Warfare or yeah in the in the</text><text start="2701.319"

rajava</text><text start="2709.359" dur="4.141">was</text><text start="2710.56" dur="5.58">um a place that was worth protecting</text><text start="2713.5" dur="4.44">because of the fact that it was trying</text><text start="2716.14" dur="4.92">to use a lot of these principles like we</text><text start="2717.94" dur="6.72">have in crypto decentralization you know</text><text start="2721.06" dur="6.6">of freedom and uh and self-determination</text><text start="2724.66" dur="5.28">and put those ideas into practice in a</text><text start="2727.66" dur="3.84">political way in a political system</text><text start="2729.94" dur="3.96">so he said that&apos;s worth protected we</text><text start="2731.5" dur="5.579">went over and the whole time that I was</text><text start="2733.9" dur="5.219">there uh The Invasion did not happen but</text><text start="2737.079" dur="4.201">every day there was there was something</text><text start="2739.119" dur="4.321">new in the news like the tanks are</text><text start="2741.28" dur="3.9">lining up on the borders you know like</text><text start="2743.44" dur="4.32">uh oh there was a there was an air</text><text start="2745.18" dur="4.62">Striker like or there was a car bomb or</text><text start="2747.76" dur="5.46">just like something always sneaking in</text><text start="2749.8" dur="5.519">at the periphery this constant pressure</text><text start="2753.22" dur="4.619">and this is a form of psychological</text><text start="2755.319" dur="5.461">warfare and the impact that this</text><text start="2757.839" dur="5.52">constant pressure has on people&apos;s minds</text><text start="2760.78" dur="4.26">is like basically twofold it puts them</text><text start="2763.359" dur="2.281">in a state of</text><text start="2765.04" dur="4.92">um</text><text start="2765.64" dur="6.78">of reactive thinking where basically</text><text start="2769.96" dur="4.08">everything is is is short-term you know</text><text start="2772.42" dur="4.26">it&apos;s like it&apos;s like net has to be done</text><text start="2774.04" dur="4.319">now and uh and there&apos;s there&apos;s a there&apos;s</text><text start="2776.68" dur="3.419">a difficulty of putting a lot creating</text><text start="2778.359" dur="5.101">long-term plans and putting them into</text><text start="2780.099" dur="5.401">practice over years huge periods of time</text><text start="2783.46" dur="4.26">which we actually see that I know a lot</text><text start="2785.5" dur="4.8">now with the Iran situation is a lot of</text><text start="2787.72" dur="4.02">people saying we got to do something we</text><text start="2790.3" dur="2.88">got to do something now you know it&apos;s</text><text start="2791.74" dur="4.26">with Sarah what&apos;s happening let&apos;s let&apos;s</text><text start="2793.18" dur="5.1">go let&apos;s go but you know the you have to</text><text start="2796.0" dur="4.319">have a long-term perspective and you</text><text start="2798.28" dur="5.28">have to have the patience and the kind</text><text start="2800.319" dur="6.0">of clarity of mind to you know work on</text><text start="2803.56" dur="4.259">these problems for years and not be in</text><text start="2806.319" dur="4.081">this reactive state of like let&apos;s just</text><text start="2807.819" dur="4.921">go go uh which is which is you know this</text><text start="2810.4" dur="5.28">is why uh the kind of trap invasion is</text><text start="2812.74" dur="3.96">is used as a war tactic so I agree with</text><text start="2815.68" dur="3.3">you that</text><text start="2816.7" dur="4.68">you know we have to have a mindset which</text><text start="2818.98" dur="4.68">is not under which is not in a state of</text><text start="2821.38" dur="4.199">worth so our our minds should not be in</text><text start="2823.66" dur="3.659">the state of War even though we&apos;re in a</text><text start="2825.579" dur="4.26">state of War</text><text start="2827.319" dur="6.601">um and you know I also agree with you</text><text start="2829.839" dur="5.041">that uh you know uh you were saying</text><text start="2833.92" dur="5.28">about</text><text start="2834.88" dur="7.02">finding non-violent means to uh to</text><text start="2839.2" dur="6.0">improve society and I and again drawing</text><text start="2841.9" dur="5.04">from the rajava revolution where uh big</text><text start="2845.2" dur="4.379">Advocates of creating educational</text><text start="2846.94" dur="5.1">infrastructure like economy systems in</text><text start="2849.579" dur="3.841">order to raise the people up you know to</text><text start="2852.04" dur="3.9">have them engaging in for example</text><text start="2853.42" dur="4.74">technology and philosophy and trying to</text><text start="2855.94" dur="4.26">create more enlightened people</text><text start="2858.16" dur="4.5">um and and that being you know the major</text><text start="2860.2" dur="4.74">revolutionary activity is actually you</text><text start="2862.66" dur="4.56">know liberating the people uh kind of</text><text start="2864.94" dur="4.32">from the bottom up and not you know not</text><text start="2867.22" dur="4.56">through some kind of violence</text><text start="2869.26" dur="5.16">um activity so you know I would I would</text><text start="2871.78" dur="4.319">I would say in those respects there&apos;s</text><text start="2874.42" dur="5.58">there&apos;s a lot of power</text><text start="2876.099" dur="6.601">parallels in in what we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="2880.0" dur="4.44">um but you know I guess the the lunapunk</text><text start="2882.7" dur="4.74">would be</text><text start="2884.44" dur="7.32">uh maybe more</text><text start="2887.44" dur="5.36">um uh so like somewhat</text><text start="2891.76" dur="3.9">um</text><text start="2892.8" dur="5.68">realist perhaps or at least trying to be</text><text start="2895.66" dur="4.86">when it came when it comes to the the</text><text start="2898.48" dur="3.9">situation that we&apos;re in and then just</text><text start="2900.52" dur="4.74">trying to be you know thinking clearly</text><text start="2902.38" dur="7.439">about ways ahead and maybe having a more</text><text start="2905.26" dur="8.76">more of a preference for uh pragmatic</text><text start="2909.819" dur="7.8">um methods like education over more</text><text start="2914.02" dur="5.28">um you know over things which are purely</text><text start="2917.619" dur="3.74">um uh</text><text start="2919.3" dur="5.76">ah</text><text start="2921.359" dur="7.24">you know just pure kind of art art and</text><text start="2925.06" dur="6.299">stuff not not like just art I find so</text><text start="2928.599" dur="3.98">much of it is like it&apos;s just like Rich</text><text start="2931.359" dur="4.98">westerners</text><text start="2932.579" dur="6.221">uh like trying to get like free up their</text><text start="2936.339" dur="4.081">guilty conscience so like I I would hope</text><text start="2938.8" dur="4.2">that I would hope that leader punks like</text><text start="2940.42" dur="4.98">try to try to be a little bit more uh</text><text start="2943.0" dur="4.8">socially conscious unlike I&apos;m like</text><text start="2945.4" dur="4.38">engaged with the the actual World At</text><text start="2947.8" dur="4.26">Large and its realities and I&apos;m not</text><text start="2949.78" dur="5.7">getting trapped in you know a lot of the</text><text start="2952.06" dur="6.96">uh culture of ethereum is is is very</text><text start="2955.48" dur="8.099">much like parties and and kind of</text><text start="2959.02" dur="5.28">um art exhibitions and you know this ICS</text><text start="2963.579" dur="2.821">um</text><text start="2964.3" dur="3.9">as I see as like</text><text start="2966.4" dur="3.6">um what do you call Ted Kaczynski has a</text><text start="2968.2" dur="3.899">great word for it surrogate activities</text><text start="2970.0" dur="3.54">which are detracting from the the</text><text start="2972.099" dur="3.301">overall mission</text><text start="2973.54" dur="4.2">I don&apos;t know I think that we need to</text><text start="2975.4" dur="5.34">create a culture here and I think that</text><text start="2977.74" dur="5.64">both are important uh also I believe</text><text start="2980.74" dur="4.44">that celebration is important</text><text start="2983.38" dur="3.6">um because it unites people and bring</text><text start="2985.18" dur="5.1">people together</text><text start="2986.98" dur="7.8">um so I definitely think that uh that we</text><text start="2990.28" dur="7.799">cannot say uh art on and let&apos;s say</text><text start="2994.78" dur="6.48">parties and so on uh are distracting us</text><text start="2998.079" dur="6.721">they are also part of growing as a human</text><text start="3001.26" dur="6.839">species they&apos;re also part of our let&apos;s</text><text start="3004.8" dur="5.94">say Evolution itself and also bring us</text><text start="3008.099" dur="5.641">together uh and we need to find those</text><text start="3010.74" dur="6.119">those places where we can share not only</text><text start="3013.74" dur="4.74">our worries but also share the things</text><text start="3016.859" dur="2.821">that we cherish and the things that we</text><text start="3018.48" dur="4.8">love</text><text start="3019.68" dur="6.84">um so I think that uh both are necessary</text><text start="3023.28" dur="5.819">uh I think that it cannot be completely</text><text start="3026.52" dur="3.839">like white or black it has to be that we</text><text start="3029.099" dur="3.181">need to find the middle ground for</text><text start="3030.359" dur="3.48">everything and also another thing that</text><text start="3032.28" dur="5.64">is important to mention is that actually</text><text start="3033.839" dur="6.301">art has been used uh as a form of</text><text start="3037.92" dur="5.159">expression</text><text start="3040.14" dur="6.3">um and art itself has been used</text><text start="3043.079" dur="5.78">um let&apos;s say through history as a as a</text><text start="3046.44" dur="6.179">way to express the feelings of people</text><text start="3048.859" dur="8.2">that might not necessarily know how to</text><text start="3052.619" dur="7.381">express it in writing or or in voice uh</text><text start="3057.059" dur="7.861">but they might uh they might represent</text><text start="3060.0" dur="7.68">it in a visual way or in a audio or in</text><text start="3064.92" dur="4.8">any other form of art let&apos;s say of</text><text start="3067.68" dur="3.72">creation and by the way I think that</text><text start="3069.72" dur="5.46">even what you guys are doing is a form</text><text start="3071.4" dur="6.06">of Art thank you uh for that</text><text start="3075.18" dur="5.1">um and you know like definitely there</text><text start="3077.46" dur="4.859">there can be good artists but I just</text><text start="3080.28" dur="4.26">find like if you go to any contemporary</text><text start="3082.319" dur="5.221">art exhibition and I say this having</text><text start="3084.54" dur="4.86">like literally studied art and uh and</text><text start="3087.54" dur="4.92">and worked as a contemporary artist but</text><text start="3089.4" dur="5.1">I just see it as like evidence of</text><text start="3092.46" dur="4.68">um Western decade and cultural</text><text start="3094.5" dur="5.579">degradation and and I see it as very</text><text start="3097.14" dur="7.02">insular and disconnected from the world</text><text start="3100.079" dur="6.301">and like you know uh the The Hunger</text><text start="3104.16" dur="3.659">Games for example the the the top</text><text start="3106.38" dur="4.92">hierarchical world where they&apos;re all</text><text start="3107.819" dur="6.481">wearing these like like wise wigs and</text><text start="3111.3" dur="6.299">like plastic skirts and that&apos;s how</text><text start="3114.3" dur="5.279">that&apos;s how uh the West seems at times</text><text start="3117.599" dur="4.74">and um</text><text start="3119.579" dur="5.101">so also parties you know on on yes</text><text start="3122.339" dur="4.921">celebration Festival it&apos;s a it&apos;s a</text><text start="3124.68" dur="4.439">integral to human activity and something</text><text start="3127.26" dur="5.16">that humans have done for you know since</text><text start="3129.119" dur="5.881">they were humans uh as far as we know</text><text start="3132.42" dur="6.0">um you know even pre-humans you know</text><text start="3135.0" dur="7.4">like had uh ceremonies</text><text start="3138.42" dur="3.98">um the however</text><text start="3142.559" dur="4.26">um when you go to again like I&apos;ve been</text><text start="3144.42" dur="5.46">to parties that parties that that I&apos;ve</text><text start="3146.819" dur="6.181">seen are not expressions of of</text><text start="3149.88" dur="6.26">um of communality or or social</text><text start="3153.0" dur="6.42">connection but they&apos;re just like nearest</text><text start="3156.14" dur="5.919">uh like depressing</text><text start="3159.42" dur="5.1">um destructive environments where people</text><text start="3162.059" dur="4.941">with no meaning in their lives go to</text><text start="3164.52" dur="6.12">shake off some of that meaninglessness</text><text start="3167.0" dur="5.619">uh which you know I&apos;m not gonna say like</text><text start="3170.64" dur="4.439">you know like each to their own or</text><text start="3172.619" dur="5.161">whatever but at least from lunar punks</text><text start="3175.079" dur="5.701">we want to create a culture</text><text start="3177.78" dur="4.62">um that is moving away from from those</text><text start="3180.78" dur="4.14">kind of those kind of surrogate</text><text start="3182.4" dur="3.84">activities and trying to give people a</text><text start="3184.92" dur="3.96">place where</text><text start="3186.24" dur="3.78">um that they can they can focus on using</text><text start="3188.88" dur="4.56">their skills and their intelligence</text><text start="3190.02" dur="5.94">their creativity to uh create tools like</text><text start="3193.44" dur="5.58">a really Drive Society forward rather</text><text start="3195.96" dur="5.639">than getting mired in all the kind of</text><text start="3199.02" dur="5.46">um like decadence and and downwards by</text><text start="3201.599" dur="5.881">ireling of Western Society</text><text start="3204.48" dur="6.119">yeah I just wanted to say that</text><text start="3207.48" dur="6.96">um you know I personally recognize uh</text><text start="3210.599" dur="5.46">Art and Science Fiction uh not just as</text><text start="3214.44" dur="3.54">an entertainment but as a form of</text><text start="3216.059" dur="3.661">activism as a form of expressing</text><text start="3217.98" dur="3.839">ourselves</text><text start="3219.72" dur="4.139">um and I think every human being is an</text><text start="3221.819" dur="4.04">artist I think every human being has</text><text start="3223.859" dur="4.2">something to give and something to</text><text start="3225.859" dur="3.22">contribute to society and that&apos;s a form</text><text start="3228.059" dur="3.841">of Art</text><text start="3229.079" dur="4.921">yeah that you know if you&apos;re willing to</text><text start="3231.9" dur="6.0">loosen your definition I mean I I guess</text><text start="3234.0" dur="5.76">my definition of art is is stricter in</text><text start="3237.9" dur="4.02">the sense that I&apos;m trying to remark on a</text><text start="3239.76" dur="6.0">specific cultural phenomena which is</text><text start="3241.92" dur="6.3">literally it&apos;s not even modernism uh</text><text start="3245.76" dur="5.88">like I feel like art has has gotten</text><text start="3248.22" dur="6.8">progressively worse over the last uh few</text><text start="3251.64" dur="6.66">centuries and that at the moment now</text><text start="3255.02" dur="5.68">it&apos;s like it&apos;s really like the art World</text><text start="3258.3" dur="5.46">itself not art as like a with a capital</text><text start="3260.7" dur="4.56">A but like the kind of the art world as</text><text start="3263.76" dur="4.079">it looks</text><text start="3265.26" dur="3.96">um from as a Westerner going into art</text><text start="3267.839" dur="2.881">exhibitions</text><text start="3269.22" dur="3.24">um again I just see I just see it as</text><text start="3270.72" dur="5.639">evidence of cultural Decline and</text><text start="3272.46" dur="5.879">narcissism and and individualism</text><text start="3276.359" dur="5.041">um you know I think there&apos;s an episode</text><text start="3278.339" dur="5.341">of Adam Curtis where he he talks about</text><text start="3281.4" dur="5.699">how um Paddy Smith</text><text start="3283.68" dur="5.28">living in New York in the 70s and she</text><text start="3287.099" dur="3.661">like that the whole scene that they&apos;re</text><text start="3288.96" dur="4.26">part of they they stop engaging</text><text start="3290.76" dur="3.72">politically with what&apos;s happening and</text><text start="3293.22" dur="3.66">they start just seeing it in purely</text><text start="3294.48" dur="5.52">aesthetic terms like oh look at this</text><text start="3296.88" dur="6.06">like environment isn&apos;t there</text><text start="3300.0" dur="4.8">like a weird Beauty to it and they just</text><text start="3302.94" dur="3.78">and they just start like hanging out and</text><text start="3304.8" dur="3.779">doing parties and</text><text start="3306.72" dur="4.56">the</text><text start="3308.579" dur="4.681">um the kind of the political side to Art</text><text start="3311.28" dur="5.16">making at that point was lost and that</text><text start="3313.26" dur="6.24">became the the status quo so I do think</text><text start="3316.44" dur="5.1">it&apos;s a way of manufacturing uh like</text><text start="3319.5" dur="4.98">controlled opposition</text><text start="3321.54" dur="4.44">um and you know and actually this kind</text><text start="3324.48" dur="3.48">of connects back to what we were saying</text><text start="3325.98" dur="4.44">about conflict and something I forgot to</text><text start="3327.96" dur="4.32">say which was that the the lunar prone</text><text start="3330.42" dur="3.84">campuses on self-defense</text><text start="3332.28" dur="5.1">so again this is coming from archelon</text><text start="3334.26" dur="3.72">but uh what channel basically says is</text><text start="3337.38" dur="3.719">um</text><text start="3337.98" dur="5.579">you have this state and the state uh</text><text start="3341.099" dur="5.161">extracts the value from society and it</text><text start="3343.559" dur="6.601">separates Society from its power and it</text><text start="3346.26" dur="7.319">does that in two ways first is it uh it</text><text start="3350.16" dur="6.0">it colonizes society&apos;s mindset so it it</text><text start="3353.579" dur="4.621">comes in and it starts to dictate how</text><text start="3356.16" dur="3.48">Society shouldn&apos;t be inherited organized</text><text start="3358.2" dur="4.26">its values</text><text start="3359.64" dur="5.16">um so Society loses its ability to</text><text start="3362.46" dur="4.32">articulate its own values that&apos;s a big</text><text start="3364.8" dur="3.299">part of how the state kind of enslaves</text><text start="3366.78" dur="3.779">society</text><text start="3368.099" dur="3.661">the second part is by taking away its</text><text start="3370.559" dur="4.441">weapons</text><text start="3371.76" dur="5.4">uh so it&apos;s means to defend itself from</text><text start="3375.0" dur="4.859">the state uh so this is how the state</text><text start="3377.16" dur="4.8">basically transforms Society into like a</text><text start="3379.859" dur="5.101">herd of animals that they can just like</text><text start="3381.96" dur="4.8">pull around and manipulate uh so a big</text><text start="3384.96" dur="6.0">part of what Luna products are trying to</text><text start="3386.76" dur="6.54">do is in a way re-weaponize Society uh</text><text start="3390.96" dur="5.04">you know not because it loves War</text><text start="3393.3" dur="4.92">because war is something abhorrent like</text><text start="3396.0" dur="3.9">definitely not promoting War but because</text><text start="3398.22" dur="5.04">uh</text><text start="3399.9" dur="6.659">but because uh self-defense is like an</text><text start="3403.26" dur="4.559">essential capability and without that</text><text start="3406.559" dur="3.121">we&apos;re</text><text start="3407.819" dur="4.381">like in the same way as without privacy</text><text start="3409.68" dur="5.46">we cannot uh live our own moral</text><text start="3412.2" dur="6.3">political Destinies and actually privacy</text><text start="3415.14" dur="6.3">is a kind of self-defense uh it&apos;s you</text><text start="3418.5" dur="5.339">know it can be a weapon in a in a set of</text><text start="3421.44" dur="4.2">tools that we can use in this way</text><text start="3423.839" dur="3.841">so</text><text start="3425.64" dur="4.56">um you know I I think that there&apos;s room</text><text start="3427.68" dur="5.46">for societies to make ours when the</text><text start="3430.2" dur="5.28">society is healthy and you know has the</text><text start="3433.14" dur="4.979">ability to have a moral and a political</text><text start="3435.48" dur="5.339">Destiny but at the moment the society is</text><text start="3438.119" dur="5.581">Enslaved the society is at War so</text><text start="3440.819" dur="5.401">personally uh like I put my own art</text><text start="3443.7" dur="4.26">practice aside I decided</text><text start="3446.22" dur="4.2">um some years ago that is not the time</text><text start="3447.96" dur="4.379">for ours uh that maybe there was a time</text><text start="3450.42" dur="4.74">for art and there will be a time for it</text><text start="3452.339" dur="5.041">but it&apos;s not this time uh so I put aside</text><text start="3455.16" dur="4.439">the artist and that&apos;s where I started</text><text start="3457.38" dur="4.5">you know getting like focusing on</text><text start="3459.599" dur="4.141">programming and because that&apos;s where I</text><text start="3461.88" dur="3.12">can see myself delivering value to</text><text start="3463.74" dur="3.18">society</text><text start="3465.0" dur="5.52">and again to me that&apos;s a form of art</text><text start="3466.92" dur="5.34">like it&apos;s a form of uh expressing</text><text start="3470.52" dur="4.44">yourself</text><text start="3472.26" dur="4.5">um is just might not be the visual way</text><text start="3474.96" dur="4.68">but you&apos;re expressing yourself in a new</text><text start="3476.76" dur="5.819">way which to me it&apos;s it&apos;s art on its own</text><text start="3479.64" dur="5.28">you know and and you&apos;re basically</text><text start="3482.579" dur="4.98">putting out there to the world the way</text><text start="3484.92" dur="6.26">that you the way that you see it and to</text><text start="3487.559" dur="3.621">me that&apos;s a form of art for sure</text><text start="3491.28" dur="5.819">so coders are artists to me as well</text><text start="3494.579" dur="3.901">so really enjoying the exchange here in</text><text start="3497.099" dur="3.901">the interest of</text><text start="3498.48" dur="3.839">limited time I would love to get us to a</text><text start="3501.0" dur="2.7">place that we&apos;re we&apos;re sort of</text><text start="3502.319" dur="2.881">converging towards an end of this</text><text start="3503.7" dur="3.119">episode</text><text start="3505.2" dur="3.48">um and and I guess you know the question</text><text start="3506.819" dur="3.841">that I&apos;ve been been one cast as I&apos;ve</text><text start="3508.68" dur="3.12">been listening to this back and forth is</text><text start="3510.66" dur="2.52">that</text><text start="3511.8" dur="3.299">um when I was doing my research on this</text><text start="3513.18" dur="3.96">episode someone pointed out to me that</text><text start="3515.099" dur="4.861">they think that like solar Punk</text><text start="3517.14" dur="5.159">cypherpunk lunar Punk Tara Punk they&apos;re</text><text start="3519.96" dur="5.04">all moral entrepreneurship in which</text><text start="3522.299" dur="4.981">we&apos;re saying that I value X and I think</text><text start="3525.0" dur="4.26">that Society is currently undervaluing X</text><text start="3527.28" dur="4.14">and through my efforts it can be</text><text start="3529.26" dur="3.42">corrected so I&apos;m wondering if we can</text><text start="3531.42" dur="4.02">kind of stick the landing on some of</text><text start="3532.68" dur="4.919">these debates and I&apos;d love to hear what</text><text start="3535.44" dur="5.46">well hey if you agree with that frame</text><text start="3537.599" dur="5.101">which maybe you don&apos;t uh what what is X</text><text start="3540.9" dur="3.659">what you know what what kind of world</text><text start="3542.7" dur="4.74">are you trying to create take us forward</text><text start="3544.559" dur="4.8">10 years in the web 3 Revolution where</text><text start="3547.44" dur="4.44">do you think that we&apos;re headed now and</text><text start="3549.359" dur="4.081">where would you like to to turn the</text><text start="3551.88" dur="3.12">ecosystem</text><text start="3553.44" dur="3.24">um and I feel like Manu I&apos;ve gone to you</text><text start="3555.0" dur="3.359">a lot so maybe Rose I&apos;ll start with you</text><text start="3556.68" dur="3.72">and go back to Manu</text><text start="3558.359" dur="2.94">yeah sure</text><text start="3560.4" dur="6.06">um</text><text start="3561.299" dur="7.981">so good question uh I I agree I I</text><text start="3566.46" dur="4.859">applaud the effort to create a</text><text start="3569.28" dur="4.92">definition that is like flexible enough</text><text start="3571.319" dur="6.0">to describe all of the punks and I think</text><text start="3574.2" dur="4.379">it does do that quite nicely like</text><text start="3577.319" dur="3.361">um</text><text start="3578.579" dur="3.841">so if if we&apos;re gonna follow along with</text><text start="3580.68" dur="4.919">this definition and say that there&apos;s one</text><text start="3582.42" dur="7.8">thing that lunapunk is things Society is</text><text start="3585.599" dur="6.181">missing it definitely is anonymity</text><text start="3590.22" dur="6.06">um and again for reasons that I&apos;ve</text><text start="3591.78" dur="7.26">stated this is uh this is seen as the in</text><text start="3596.28" dur="5.7">the positive sense of anonymity being a</text><text start="3599.04" dur="5.46">means for communities to Define new</text><text start="3601.98" dur="4.56">moral political Destinies and that</text><text start="3604.5" dur="4.559">sounds a bit uh that might sound a bit</text><text start="3606.54" dur="4.799">abstract but again to you know make a</text><text start="3609.059" dur="5.28">concrete and practical</text><text start="3611.339" dur="6.421">um I really think Anonymous dialers are</text><text start="3614.339" dur="6.48">are going to be the frontier of this uh</text><text start="3617.76" dur="7.079">like moral political expansion of</text><text start="3620.819" dur="8.221">society uh so Society beginning to carve</text><text start="3624.839" dur="5.701">out new zones that are outside the</text><text start="3629.04" dur="4.079">um influence and oppression by state</text><text start="3630.54" dur="5.519">structures and that can live their own</text><text start="3633.119" dur="4.801">um value systems so that&apos;s why I&apos;m</text><text start="3636.059" dur="6.78">really excited about what we&apos;re trying</text><text start="3637.92" dur="7.1">to engineer now inside of uh of of dark</text><text start="3642.839" dur="7.141">fight and this this world this Vision</text><text start="3645.02" dur="8.74">that we&apos;re trying to compose of a like a</text><text start="3649.98" dur="7.02">plural verse if you will of uh a</text><text start="3653.76" dur="5.16">plurality of different worlds in which</text><text start="3657.0" dur="4.02">communities can Define their own moral</text><text start="3658.92" dur="4.679">political Destinies we call that world</text><text start="3661.02" dur="3.36">the Dark Forest</text><text start="3663.599" dur="3.841">um</text><text start="3664.38" dur="5.28">and that&apos;s a spin on an existing concept</text><text start="3667.44" dur="3.6">that uh that comes from the the tree</text><text start="3669.66" dur="4.199">body problem</text><text start="3671.04" dur="4.92">um Sci-Fi series and also gets talked</text><text start="3673.859" dur="5.401">about a lot in ethereum</text><text start="3675.96" dur="5.04">but it&apos;s usually used in ethereum as a</text><text start="3679.26" dur="3.72">as a critique</text><text start="3681.0" dur="5.28">um against the transparency of the</text><text start="3682.98" dur="5.099">mempool where uh essentially the mempool</text><text start="3686.28" dur="6.059">is transparent which means that you can</text><text start="3688.079" dur="7.201">do Mev and you can Harvest users uh for</text><text start="3692.339" dur="4.5">their revenue that in a way you&apos;re this</text><text start="3695.28" dur="3.6">parasitic you&apos;re extracting the value</text><text start="3696.839" dur="3.841">created by the user base</text><text start="3698.88" dur="4.62">um so that&apos;s that&apos;s what&apos;s become known</text><text start="3700.68" dur="5.28">as dark forest and eth how we call it in</text><text start="3703.5" dur="5.04">dark by uh you know repurpose this term</text><text start="3705.96" dur="4.56">and and and we said actually forest</text><text start="3708.54" dur="4.559">forest environment is something we want</text><text start="3710.52" dur="4.74">to create forests</text><text start="3713.099" dur="6.2">um you know historically have have often</text><text start="3715.26" dur="6.78">been a place of sanctuary which protects</text><text start="3719.299" dur="5.201">inhabitants and a big example of this</text><text start="3722.04" dur="5.16">that draws on my own background is is in</text><text start="3724.5" dur="5.64">Ireland where the forests</text><text start="3727.2" dur="4.44">were uh the the the the Island used to</text><text start="3730.14" dur="2.459">be covered in forests until fairly</text><text start="3731.64" dur="4.08">recently</text><text start="3732.599" dur="4.5">and the forests were um a large part of</text><text start="3735.72" dur="4.139">what allowed Ireland to resist</text><text start="3737.099" dur="4.5">carnalization and to uphold you know the</text><text start="3739.859" dur="3.421">the previous the Gaelic civilization</text><text start="3741.599" dur="3.24">that had existed there</text><text start="3743.28" dur="3.6">um and as far as we&apos;re integral to</text><text start="3744.839" dur="4.98">society they they shaped the the</text><text start="3746.88" dur="5.219">language and that that uh the the</text><text start="3749.819" dur="5.161">written alphabet was named after trees</text><text start="3752.099" dur="6.48">you know they shared the spirituality</text><text start="3754.98" dur="5.579">um which was Pagan religion uh with lots</text><text start="3758.579" dur="4.74">of forest deities and so they had this</text><text start="3760.559" dur="4.8">big impact and they also uh were a place</text><text start="3763.319" dur="4.081">where you can coordinate</text><text start="3765.359" dur="4.321">um and and plot</text><text start="3767.4" dur="4.8">um rebellions against the invading</text><text start="3769.68" dur="5.1">forces and so that was why the forests</text><text start="3772.2" dur="4.26">were targeted by the like colonizing</text><text start="3774.78" dur="2.76">Britain Britain</text><text start="3776.46" dur="3.42">um they were they were they were</text><text start="3777.54" dur="3.779">systematically cleared for a large one</text><text start="3779.88" dur="3.12">of the things was because it was</text><text start="3781.319" dur="4.26">profitable to do so but another reason</text><text start="3783.0" dur="4.559">was because they didn&apos;t want uh Irish</text><text start="3785.579" dur="4.561">people being able to anonymously</text><text start="3787.559" dur="4.981">coordinate uh inside of the forests so</text><text start="3790.14" dur="5.76">they cleared them again I really see a</text><text start="3792.54" dur="6.84">Anonymous days and and the kind of uh</text><text start="3795.9" dur="5.52">anonymized landscape that done new kinds</text><text start="3799.38" dur="6.3">of violent Moreland political Society</text><text start="3801.42" dur="6.96">societies to take root uh and form</text><text start="3805.68" dur="6.72">menu same question to you</text><text start="3808.38" dur="6.0">yeah from my side I see short-term</text><text start="3812.4" dur="4.26">um that more governments are gonna try</text><text start="3814.38" dur="4.86">to oppress</text><text start="3816.66" dur="4.32">um uh so they can keep the power that</text><text start="3819.24" dur="6.42">they have</text><text start="3820.98" dur="8.28">um but also I I am super optimistic I</text><text start="3825.66" dur="6.0">see that we&apos;re gonna come together as a</text><text start="3829.26" dur="5.64">human species we have for the first time</text><text start="3831.66" dur="5.88">the tools to communicate and to create</text><text start="3834.9" dur="4.439">value and exchange value globally for</text><text start="3837.54" dur="4.64">the first time</text><text start="3839.339" dur="6.48">um and yeah I think that we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="3842.18" dur="5.98">let&apos;s say evolve and achieve a</text><text start="3845.819" dur="5.821">collective Consciousness that will</text><text start="3848.16" dur="6.12">enable us to understand that</text><text start="3851.64" dur="6.36">um that nation states uh that are</text><text start="3854.28" dur="6.42">basically imposed on us are not the way</text><text start="3858.0" dur="6.599">to go but has there has to be a new form</text><text start="3860.7" dur="6.78">that we create or own and that we uh</text><text start="3864.599" dur="6.121">let&apos;s say up team and also have the</text><text start="3867.48" dur="4.619">possibility of opt-out as well uh and</text><text start="3870.72" dur="4.379">that&apos;s kind of like the future that I&apos;m</text><text start="3872.099" dur="5.7">seeing and I believe that every single</text><text start="3875.099" dur="4.321">human being is a Creator I believe that</text><text start="3877.799" dur="5.221">every single human being is an artist</text><text start="3879.42" dur="6.3">and it would they will and we will uh</text><text start="3883.02" dur="4.5">understand it and we will see it when we</text><text start="3885.72" dur="4.859">understand that we have the power to</text><text start="3887.52" dur="7.86">create and also the power to destroy uh</text><text start="3890.579" dur="6.48">and we have the we have the um we&apos;re</text><text start="3895.38" dur="4.56">gonna have the</text><text start="3897.059" dur="4.26">um let&apos;s say capability of deciding what</text><text start="3899.94" dur="3.78">is it that we want to do if it&apos;s</text><text start="3901.319" dur="6.421">creating or destroying</text><text start="3903.72" dur="7.139">um and I also think that each of us uh</text><text start="3907.74" dur="4.68">is building pieces of the Apostle and</text><text start="3910.859" dur="3.421">now it&apos;s time that we bring all those</text><text start="3912.42" dur="3.36">all of those pieces of the Apostle</text><text start="3914.28" dur="2.94">together</text><text start="3915.78" dur="5.519">um because</text><text start="3917.22" dur="7.8">what uh let&apos;s say what a rose was saying</text><text start="3921.299" dur="7.56">I also agree we need that we we also</text><text start="3925.02" dur="6.059">need privacy preserving uh tools</text><text start="3928.859" dur="4.141">um and yeah it&apos;s used a matter of</text><text start="3931.079" dur="4.74">bringing all of those forces together</text><text start="3933.0" dur="4.799">and creating systems that as I said</text><text start="3935.819" dur="3.661">before allow us to obtain or opt out</text><text start="3937.799" dur="4.32">whenever we want</text><text start="3939.48" dur="5.28">um but yeah that&apos;s that&apos;s what I that&apos;s</text><text start="3942.119" dur="5.22">how I Envision it I&apos;m very optimistic I</text><text start="3944.76" dur="5.819">think the war is gonna become better</text><text start="3947.339" dur="5.22">than what we currently have because uh I</text><text start="3950.579" dur="4.26">believe in the power of good</text><text start="3952.559" dur="4.141">alrighty well it uh we&apos;re just about out</text><text start="3954.839" dur="3.361">of time it&apos;s we&apos;re a half hour over

rose</text><text start="3983.099" dur="8.46">Express I also share those ideas</text><text start="3987.0" dur="6.66">um and I personally believe that we need</text><text start="3991.559" dur="5.101">to create more narratives that actually</text><text start="3993.66" dur="4.74">unite us rather than a narratives that</text><text start="3996.66" dur="3.959">separate us and that try to point</text><text

the</text><text start="4056.78" dur="2.819">Apostles on their own and now it&apos;s time</text><text start="4058.28" dur="2.94">to bring them together and build</text><text start="4059.599" dur="4.381">together</text><text start="4061.22" dur="5.28">um and yeah that&apos;s it thank you again uh</text><text start="4063.98" dur="6.42">Kevin and Rose for this amazing chat</text><text start="4066.5" dur="6.539">yeah so when Bitcoin and also ethereum</text><text start="4070.4" dur="5.88">were first created but most like big</text><text start="4073.039" dur="5.76">word anyway when they&apos;re first created</text><text start="4076.28" dur="4.68">um a lot of this tooling around privacy</text><text start="4078.799" dur="5.101">and anonymity didn&apos;t exist</text><text start="4080.96" dur="5.52">uh so it&apos;s only very recently that we&apos;ve</text><text start="4083.9" dur="4.919">had the capabilities to actually have</text><text start="4086.48" dur="4.319">for example fully Anonymous smart</text><text start="4088.819" dur="4.921">contracts</text><text start="4090.799" dur="6.121">um so but the time is now like the this</text><text start="4093.74" dur="4.68">tooling has finally become accessible to</text><text start="4096.92" dur="4.259">Developers</text><text start="4098.42" dur="4.2">and therefore it will soon be accessible</text><text start="4101.179" dur="3.961">to users</text><text start="4102.62" dur="5.76">um so I would just uh encourage everyone</text><text start="4105.14" dur="6.24">uh especially solar punks uh to think</text><text start="4108.38" dur="5.28">about like the</text><text start="4111.38" dur="6.0">the Reliance that they&apos;re that their</text><text start="4113.66" dur="6.659">engineering has on transparency and the</text><text start="4117.38" dur="6.12">risks that that poses to its user base</text><text start="4120.319" dur="5.581">given the situation that we&apos;re in of</text><text start="4123.5" dur="4.279">regulatory conflict</text><text start="4125.9" dur="4.62">um so</text><text start="4127.779" dur="5.381">uh so I would I would just encourage</text><text start="4130.52" dur="4.56">them to that process of of internal</text><text start="4133.16" dur="4.38">reflection</text><text start="4135.08" dur="5.699">um and and because of the fact that</text><text start="4137.54" dur="6.9">ethereum early on and also Bitcoin they</text><text start="4140.779" dur="5.52">made this trade enough and and and it</text><text start="4144.44" dur="3.96">was probably correct at the time given</text><text start="4146.299" dur="4.02">the technical restraints but they said</text><text start="4148.4" dur="5.7">let&apos;s prioritize scaling and let&apos;s</text><text start="4150.319" dur="7.261">de-prioritize the Privacy aspect and but</text><text start="4154.1" dur="6.179">because of this Choice uh we have had a</text><text start="4157.58" dur="6.9">design space that&apos;s developed on eth</text><text start="4160.279" dur="7.261">that is uh completely biased towards uh</text><text start="4164.48" dur="5.1">full information is always available at</text><text start="4167.54" dur="5.4">all times so we have a lot of</text><text start="4169.58" dur="4.5">engineering that is uh dependent on for</text><text start="4172.94" dur="4.68">example</text><text start="4174.08" dur="5.699">strong concepts of identity and but not</text><text start="4177.62" dur="4.079">just identity like which is a big part</text><text start="4179.779" dur="5.161">of the solar Punk uh you know</text><text start="4181.699" dur="5.721">engineering space but also more simply</text><text start="4184.94" dur="6.359">just uh</text><text start="4187.42" dur="6.399">transparent data in general so like</text><text start="4191.299" dur="5.761">known variables the classic example of</text><text start="4193.819" dur="5.221">the amm is the amm which cannot be done</text><text start="4197.06" dur="5.94">privacy privately without some like</text><text start="4199.04" dur="6.12">major uh changes to the design because</text><text start="4203.0" dur="4.56">the way that the Airman is the the</text><text start="4205.16" dur="5.7">mechanism of the amm</text><text start="4207.56" dur="6.0">um is requires you to know the entire</text><text start="4210.86" dur="4.5">state of the program so that means like</text><text start="4213.56" dur="3.72">you need to know all the money coming in</text><text start="4215.36" dur="4.2">all the money going out all the money</text><text start="4217.28" dur="4.02">that&apos;s there at all times in order to</text><text start="4219.56" dur="4.2">calculate</text><text start="4221.3" dur="4.32">the price along the curve which is</text><text start="4223.76" dur="3.66">essentially what the amm Primitive is is</text><text start="4225.62" dur="4.44">trying to do it&apos;s a price Discovery</text><text start="4227.42" dur="4.68">mechanism in a detailed decentralized</text><text start="4230.06" dur="3.9">way and it&apos;s very interesting uh</text><text start="4232.1" dur="4.02">primitive and it you know it&apos;s very it&apos;s</text><text start="4233.96" dur="4.199">revolutionary in its own right but it</text><text start="4236.12" dur="4.38">cannot be done privately so in order</text><text start="4238.159" dur="5.101">like without significant trade-offs so</text><text start="4240.5" dur="5.94">in order to uh in order to enter the</text><text start="4243.26" dur="5.28">next phase of crypto&apos;s advancement where</text><text start="4246.44" dur="5.64">it can actually truly Define its own</text><text start="4248.54" dur="6.84">political Destiny we need to uh Master</text><text start="4252.08" dur="5.28">what we call Anonymous engineering which</text><text start="4255.38" dur="4.2">is Engineering in a context where you</text><text start="4257.36" dur="5.339">don&apos;t have all the information and where</text><text start="4259.58" dur="6.659">you can&apos;t choose to for example</text><text start="4262.699" dur="5.281">docs in person in order to have a strong</text><text start="4266.239" dur="4.5">concept of identity within your program</text><text start="4267.98" dur="4.02">so we need to we need to change our</text><text start="4270.739" dur="4.801">mindset when it comes to engineering</text><text start="4272.0" dur="5.64">these programs towards a new Anonymous</text><text start="4275.54" dur="5.28">Paradigm so it&apos;s a really exciting</text><text start="4277.64" dur="5.34">moment and uh I think you know ethereum</text><text start="4280.82" dur="5.7">has got a great community so many smart</text><text start="4282.98" dur="6.6">people uh but they need</text><text start="4286.52" dur="6.12">to like step up to the reality that</text><text start="4289.58" dur="4.8">we&apos;re in and uh and start engaging in</text><text start="4292.64" dur="2.88">Anonymous engineering</text><text start="4294.38" dur="3.799">um because that&apos;s how that&apos;s where</text><text start="4295.52" dur="2.659">things are headed</text><text start="4298.64" dur="3.72">amazing</text><text start="4300.56" dur="4.8">um I just really appreciated the</text><text start="4302.36" dur="4.26">discussion and um this this podcast has</text><text start="4305.36" dur="2.339">been like two or three months in the</text><text start="4306.62" dur="3.24">planning and I just want to thank you</text><text start="4307.699" dur="4.681">both for not only being so thoughtful</text><text start="4309.86" dur="4.98">but also approaching this from good</text><text start="4312.38" dur="4.859">faith it seems to me like there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="4314.84" dur="3.78">to be learned from each other and I just</text><text start="4317.239" dur="3.181">really appreciating the diverging and</text><text start="4318.62" dur="6.079">converging perspectives here so thank</text><text start="4320.42" dur="4.279">you to you both for for the conversation</text><text start="4325.239" dur="3.581">thank you</text><text start="4327.37"
