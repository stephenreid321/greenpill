start="267.9" dur="4.2">topic is this really obnoxious tweet</text><text start="270.419" dur="3.381">that I sent that said web3 is the new</text><text start="272.1" dur="4.98">Occupy Wall Street</text><text start="273.8" dur="5.02">uh which you know uh created some debate</text><text start="277.08" dur="4.08">on Twitter but you know the things that</text><text start="278.82" dur="5.76">I see are that there&apos;s a lot of X Occupy</text><text start="281.16" dur="6.06">Wall Street people building in web 3</text><text start="284.58" dur="4.14">um and because of that we have a lot of</text><text start="287.22" dur="3.3">being able to think differently and swim</text><text start="288.72" dur="3.66">against the mainstream current uh</text><text start="290.52" dur="4.38">there&apos;s a focus in the space on group</text><text start="292.38" dur="4.92">collective intelligence over hierarchy</text><text start="294.9" dur="4.44">and to focus on Wall Street and its</text><text start="297.3" dur="3.6">Financial rails but building an open</text><text start="299.34" dur="3.72">source Financial system it&apos;s an</text><text start="300.9" dur="3.9">alternative to Wall Street for a new</text><text start="303.06" dur="3.84">generation and those are the parallels</text><text start="304.8" dur="4.86">that I saw between Occupy Wall Street</text><text start="306.9" dur="5.22">and web3 that caused me to send that</text><text start="309.66" dur="3.78">really obnoxious tweet but uh I think</text><text start="312.12" dur="5.28">that the three of us were kind of</text><text start="313.44" dur="6.6">debating in the replies the merits of uh</text><text start="317.4" dur="4.92">of the parallel and and I felt like it</text><text start="320.04" dur="4.14">was an important conversation and worth</text><text start="322.32" dur="4.74">having living in a more High context</text><text start="324.18" dur="4.739">environment than on Twitter replies so</text><text start="327.06" dur="4.26">um Sarah maybe I&apos;ll go to you first just</text><text start="328.919" dur="4.681">to tee things off what is your uh what</text><text start="331.32" dur="5.099">is your reaction to the statement web3</text><text start="333.6" dur="4.8">is the new Occupy Wall Street</text><text start="336.419" dur="3.901">my reaction was a lot of resistance</text><text start="338.4" dur="3.359">personally</text><text start="340.32" dur="2.939">um and I and I was thinking about this</text><text start="341.759" dur="3.421">morning I think a lot of this really</text><text start="343.259" dur="5.041">roots in</text><text start="345.18" dur="4.26">what we&apos;re using as our description of</text><text start="348.3" dur="3.179">web3</text><text start="349.44" dur="4.02">if we&apos;re talking about the social impact</text><text start="351.479" dur="4.921">quarter of web 3 the environmental</text><text start="353.46" dur="5.4">impact quarter of web 3 I think that</text><text start="356.4" dur="4.739">there are more parallels to the</text><text start="358.86" dur="6.0">underlying ethos of Occupy Wall Street</text><text start="361.139" dur="4.681">than if you look at crypto or web3 at</text><text start="364.86" dur="4.8">Large</text><text start="365.82" dur="6.36">but I think at a pattern level of humans</text><text start="369.66" dur="5.34">and organizing and decision making and</text><text start="372.18" dur="4.98">decentralization no matter what use case</text><text start="375.0" dur="5.699">we&apos;re taking a look at there are a lot</text><text start="377.16" dur="6.84">of parallels to what really happened in</text><text start="380.699" dur="5.701">a natural organic and unexpected way in</text><text start="384.0" dur="5.16">Ducati Park in regards to how people</text><text start="386.4" dur="5.4">gather how they make decisions</text><text start="389.16" dur="6.0">um and I think that there&apos;s really a big</text><text start="391.8" dur="5.7">difference between what it&apos;s like to be</text><text start="395.16" dur="5.099">in a crowd of 5 000 people making a</text><text start="397.5" dur="5.699">decision on what it&apos;s like to be you</text><text start="400.259" dur="6.0">know on the internet on Twitter on a</text><text start="403.199" dur="5.101">commonwealth Forum having an opinion the</text><text start="406.259" dur="5.041">discourse and the environment of that</text><text start="408.3" dur="4.5">and the energy of that to me are really</text><text start="411.3" dur="4.38">fundamentally different lived</text><text start="412.8" dur="4.019">experiences so I&apos;m excited to dig in</text><text start="415.68" dur="3.359">because I think there&apos;s some</text><text start="416.819" dur="4.621">similarities and some differences that I</text><text start="419.039" dur="3.78">do think are really important to tease</text><text start="421.44" dur="3.539">out</text><text start="422.819" dur="4.141">yeah where I</text><text start="424.979" dur="3.84">I completely agree with you at the</text><text start="426.96" dur="3.299">experiential level and maybe even at the</text><text start="428.819" dur="4.801">cultural level there&apos;s some really</text><text start="430.259" dur="6.66">important parallels or distinctions</text><text start="433.62" dur="6.24">um the reason I feel like web3 is is in</text><text start="436.919" dur="5.241">some ways an evolution of occupy is</text><text start="439.86" dur="6.179">around what occupy was trying to achieve</text><text start="442.16" dur="7.84">and there was this rise in awareness of</text><text start="446.039" dur="5.581">the inherent systemic Corruption of our</text><text start="450.0" dur="5.22">financial system</text><text start="451.62" dur="4.76">and yet the kind of means of redress of</text><text start="455.22" dur="5.64">that grievance</text><text start="456.38" dur="6.58">was an encampment that struggled to</text><text start="460.86" dur="6.899">actually</text><text start="462.96" dur="6.78">create an alternative or to get a new</text><text start="467.759" dur="4.44">Financial system</text><text start="469.74" dur="5.82">um that could solve a lot of those</text><text start="472.199" dur="4.801">Grievances and so I think it was an</text><text start="475.56" dur="3.96">important cultural moment of bringing</text><text start="477.0" dur="4.02">awareness to the Brokenness of our</text><text start="479.52" dur="4.519">financial system</text><text start="481.02" dur="5.64">but where I see web3 continuing that Arc</text><text start="484.039" dur="6.16">is actually being able to provide the</text><text start="486.66" dur="5.4">infrastructure that would create the</text><text start="490.199" dur="3.421">foundation for a new economic system</text><text start="492.06" dur="4.02">that could have different design</text><text start="493.62" dur="5.28">principles than our current one and I</text><text start="496.08" dur="5.76">think we&apos;re seeing with things like FTX</text><text start="498.9" dur="5.34">that a lot of the principles of</text><text start="501.84" dur="5.1">decentralization have been kind of lost</text><text start="504.24" dur="4.98">in the early commodification of web3 but</text><text start="506.94" dur="4.5">I think at The Primitives level</text><text start="509.22" dur="3.96">um we have a lot more tools that we can</text><text start="511.44" dur="5.159">work with to actually achieve the goals</text><text start="513.18" dur="5.64">of occupy now than we did in 2011.</text><text start="516.599" dur="4.44">yeah I definitely agree with that I mean</text><text start="518.82" dur="4.2">I think for me the part that I get stuck</text><text start="521.039" dur="3.36">on really comes down to what is the</text><text start="523.02" dur="3.18">point of web3</text><text start="524.399" dur="4.801">and if you take a look at the vast</text><text start="526.2" dur="4.92">majority of web3 it really is about</text><text start="529.2" dur="4.259">something distinctly to do with the</text><text start="531.12" dur="4.38">financial system it&apos;s it&apos;s a D5 exchange</text><text start="533.459" dur="4.88">it&apos;s some sort of dap it&apos;s really</text><text start="535.5" dur="7.26">focused frankly on people making money</text><text start="538.339" dur="7.481">whereas occupy was focused on having a</text><text start="542.76" dur="6.42">radical disruption experience that was</text><text start="545.82" dur="5.699">very direct action oriented both in the</text><text start="549.18" dur="5.279">park and in the marches in the actual</text><text start="551.519" dur="5.76">Street activism that was really</text><text start="554.459" dur="4.921">associated with that experience and what</text><text start="557.279" dur="4.201">it was trying to do there in the</text><text start="559.38" dur="4.86">financial district would say the</text><text start="561.48" dur="6.24">underlying structure of capitalism as a</text><text start="564.24" dur="7.56">concept is sick it is a sickness that is</text><text start="567.72" dur="8.059">cultural that is really evolved across</text><text start="571.8" dur="7.32">the entire globe and so to me I struggle</text><text start="575.779" dur="6.221">to get over that hurdle in comparison</text><text start="579.12" dur="5.36">because I do think that the vast</text><text start="582.0" dur="4.68">majority of web 3 activity is about</text><text start="584.48" dur="4.18">individuals making money</text><text start="586.68" dur="4.38">and there&apos;s all these components that</text><text start="588.66" dur="5.64">really do reflect an evolution from</text><text start="591.06" dur="5.7">occupy the holding of your own Keys the</text><text start="594.3" dur="4.8">decentralization of validators on proof</text><text start="596.76" dur="4.68">of stake chains the decentralized</text><text start="599.1" dur="4.679">decision-making mechanism the fact that</text><text start="601.44" dur="4.26">you can jump into a protocol and write</text><text start="603.779" dur="4.5">your own smart contract there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="605.7" dur="5.22">decentralization and autonomy inside of</text><text start="608.279" dur="5.281">the web 3 systems that we work with on a</text><text start="610.92" dur="5.58">technical level but to me the vast</text><text start="613.56" dur="5.7">majority of that is still about people</text><text start="616.5" dur="5.82">making money first and foremost</text><text start="619.26" dur="4.92">and any occupation that was not the goal</text><text start="622.32" dur="4.5">the goal was not for the people that</text><text start="624.18" dur="4.38">showed up to make money and because of</text><text start="626.82" dur="4.32">that there were millions and millions of</text><text start="628.56" dur="4.2">dollars of donations that came in and</text><text start="631.14" dur="4.259">then there were consensus mechanisms</text><text start="632.76" dur="4.5">that were enormously public that anybody</text><text start="635.399" dur="3.541">could join about how that money should</text><text start="637.26" dur="3.54">be distributed</text><text start="638.94" dur="5.16">so for me I think that&apos;s the real</text><text start="640.8" dur="5.099">struggle and I I think about it on the</text><text start="644.1" dur="4.2">level of art I think about it on the</text><text start="645.899" dur="4.62">level of intention I think about it and</text><text start="648.3" dur="5.479">the level of water rebuilding and why</text><text start="650.519" dur="6.301">and being from a protocol that is</text><text start="653.779" dur="6.581">environmental rails Financial Solutions</text><text

dur="5.219">um around our industry from our</text><text start="980.88" dur="5.34">regulatory level because I think there&apos;s</text><text start="983.279" dur="4.8">so much Wall Street Capital in all

dur="4.62">mechanism a social decision-making</text><text start="1003.259" dur="6.541">that&apos;s mechanism a social graph a trust</text><text start="1006.199" dur="5.94">graph a truth graph and we

dur="3.42">um because to me</text><text start="1021.56" dur="4.279">you know a lot of the Occupy Wall Street</text><text start="1023.42" dur="5.879">notes are lost somewhere in a Google</text><text

look forward to how we</text><text start="1045.98" dur="5.28">communicate our use cases and how we</text><text start="1048.38" dur="4.44">build public conferences about them the</text><text start="1051.26" dur="4.32">one thing I walked away with more than</text><text start="1052.82" dur="5.16">anything from occupy is a love of public</text><text start="1055.58" dur="4.08">decision making

dur="4.38">decisions and helping people make</text><text start="1063.38" dur="5.1">decisions and I think we have a real</text><text start="1066.02" dur="3.96">opportunity to build a shared

start="1084.26" dur="5.159">but I think it demands something more of</text><text start="1086.78" dur="6.12">us on a soul level and so I&apos;m kind of</text><text start="1089.419" dur="5.88">excited about the bear Market because I</text><text start="1092.9" dur="4.5">just think that we can evolve why we&apos;re</text><text start="1095.299" dur="6.061">here and our intentions more authentic</text><text start="1097.4" dur="6.54">way when we&apos;re not stuck in a hype cycle</text><text start="1101.36" dur="4.439">and I think the social dimension of</text><text start="1103.94" dur="5.76">governance is something that the Dow</text><text start="1105.799" dur="6.361">space is still learning and</text><text start="1109.7" dur="4.32">yet there&apos;s this whole other body

dur="5.52">the web 3 space and that intersection is</text><text start="1118.4" dur="5.34">really interesting to me because Dao&apos;s</text><text start="1121.34" dur="4.14">create a kind of back end for</text><text start="1123.74" dur="4.799">distributed decision making but like</text><text start="1125.48" dur="5.4">what the social process is to scaffold</text><text start="1128.539" dur="4.26">the the integration of perspectives and</text><text start="1130.88" dur="3.9">and listening to each other and finding</text><text start="1132.799" dur="4.801">decisions that are actually more</text><text start="1134.78" dur="6.18">consensus based than like first passive</text><text start="1137.6" dur="5.459">post voting or reputation based</text><text start="1140.96" dur="4.26">um but when I imagine occupy happening</text><text start="1143.059" dur="5.041">again now</text><text start="1145.22" dur="4.74">powered by Dows and to actually have be</text><text start="1148.1"

became a permaculture</text><text start="1422.84" dur="2.4">designer</text><text start="1423.86" dur="3.179">there were folks that were Building</text><text start="1425.24" dur="3.36">green water

dur="4.919">these amazing organizers in New England</text><text start="1432.679" dur="5.641">I got to go to all of these classes we</text><text start="1435.559" dur="4.62">replanted all them Ducati

dur="5.58">developed bicycle uh generator systems</text><text start="1445.94" dur="5.52">that ran all of the Power for press and</text><text start="1448.46" dur="4.86">media and then eventually when we got</text><text start="1451.46" dur="4.92">rated and I do think we got rated</text><text start="1453.32" dur="5.64">because of us this is my theory in the</text><text start="1456.38" dur="4.38">end I think we got rated because we had</text><text start="1458.96" dur="4.199">developed a decentralized power system</text><text start="1460.76" dur="4.38">that the people could bike on themselves</text><text start="1463.159" dur="3.781">after they turned the power off in the</text><text start="1465.14" dur="3.96">park as a way to try to Scamper us out</text><text start="1466.94" dur="5.28">of there because it was the night that</text><text start="1469.1" dur="4.74">we distributed the Final 14 bikes that</text><text start="1472.22" dur="5.4">they got rated</text><text start="1473.84" dur="5.94">um so I afterwards really I became a</text><text start="1477.62" dur="5.64">designer I became a Solutions architect</text><text start="1479.78" dur="5.82">and spent a Whole

dur="5.22">this I have this new desire to protest</text><text start="1507.02" dur="4.62">and it&apos;s not that I would go in the</text><text start="1509.12" dur="4.98">street but I think being comfortable</text><text start="1511.64" dur="5.1">enough being vulnerable</text><text start="1514.1" dur="5.819">um and speaking up is a really critical</text><text start="1516.74" dur="5.88">aspect of intervening in our complacency</text><text start="1519.919" dur="4.801">and you know now that I have more</text><text start="1522.62" dur="3.72">technical experience under my belt I can</text><text start="1524.72" dur="3.6">I can explain to you how the different</text><text start="1526.34" dur="3.6">blockchains work and how the assets move</text><text start="1528.32" dur="4.08">and the

start="1534.5" dur="7.26">um I find this this new arrival at a</text><text start="1538.279" dur="6.121">point of saying in these cycles that</text><text start="1541.76" dur="5.039">we&apos;re in we have to speak up and not be</text><text start="1544.4" dur="5.34">complacent and so our voice and our</text><text start="1546.799" dur="4.86">creation is in fact protest as well as</text><text

my question is</text><text start="1556.4" dur="4.259">really like</text><text start="1558.2" dur="4.5">what is our shared value set</text><text start="1560.659" dur="6.26">can we build one can we have a</text><text start="1562.7" dur="6.959">collective cross protocol cross whatever</text><text start="1566.919" dur="6.061">consensus process around what we think</text><text start="1569.659" dur="5.88">that our value set is because I fear</text><text start="1572.98" dur="4.299">that you know the occupation had its</text><text start="1575.539" dur="4.26">principles it had its little pamphlet</text><text start="1577.279" dur="4.921">you knew you knew when everybody thought</text><text start="1579.799" dur="4.201">they were there for and in that park</text><text start="1582.2" dur="3.959">there was the beating drum like</text><text start="1584.0" dur="3.6">literally the guys that literally they</text><text start="1586.159" dur="3.9">took it on themselves to literally have</text><text start="1587.6" dur="4.559">a drum circle for like six months</text><text start="1590.059" dur="3.841">straight like nobody stopped drumming no</text><text start="1592.159" dur="3.421">matter what time of day it was to the</text><text start="1593.9" dur="4.68">point where you were begging them to</text><text start="1595.58" dur="5.52">stop but what is our heartbeat as a</text><text start="1598.58" dur="4.8">community what are we here to build and</text><text start="1601.1" dur="4.38">how do we build cross-organizational</text><text start="1603.38" dur="4.08">consensus around what that mechanism</text><text start="1605.48" dur="4.199">should look like in a way where we can</text><text start="1607.46" dur="4.68">be decentralized but we can come</text><text start="1609.679" dur="4.681">together with a shared ethos I&apos;m looking</text><text start="1612.14" dur="4.38">for that charity ethos being this far</text><text start="1614.36" dur="4.679">along in this journey and I&apos;m looking</text><text start="1616.52" dur="4.92">for how we build charity ethos across</text><text start="1619.039" dur="4.74">whose Tech is best and who&apos;s protocols</text><text start="1621.44" dur="4.859">flies or who thinks they&apos;re you know</text><text start="1623.779" dur="4.14">fanciest on the deck here I want to know</text><text start="1626.299" dur="4.201">what we all want to create in the world</text><text start="1627.919" dur="4.5">together and find ways for us all to</text><text start="1630.5" dur="3.9">work together and build that consensus</text><text start="1632.419" dur="4.38">to me that&apos;s really the Golden Nugget</text><text start="1634.4" dur="6.18">for us as a community moving forward</text><text start="1636.799" dur="7.26">I&apos;ve been using this phrase kind of</text><text start="1640.58" dur="4.86">largely inspired by Kevin about Civic</text><text start="1644.059" dur="3.061">hyperstructures the phrase</text><text start="1645.44" dur="3.719">hyperstructure and you put Civic in</text><text start="1647.12" dur="4.86">front of it there&apos;s something about</text><text start="1649.159" dur="5.52">like how do we facilitate the</text><text start="1651.98" dur="5.819">process of alignment between different</text><text start="1654.679" dur="5.36">social groups and actors one thing I</text><text start="1657.799" dur="4.921">noticed in your share was just how</text><text start="1660.039" dur="4.721">intensified the political polarization</text><text start="1662.72" dur="4.319">and the identity politics has become in</text><text start="1664.76" dur="3.98">the last 10 years since occupy and it&apos;s</text><text start="1667.039" dur="4.801">actually even hard for me to imagine</text><text start="1668.74" dur="5.62">that kind of pluralistic or diverse of a</text><text start="1671.84" dur="4.68">group of people in one movement today it</text><text start="1674.36" dur="5.52">feels like you have to be part of more</text><text start="1676.52" dur="5.7">of a niche movement context in order to</text><text start="1679.88" dur="5.34">speak the same language and be seen as</text><text start="1682.22" dur="4.74">on the in-group of of that and so I&apos;m</text><text start="1685.22" dur="4.199">I don&apos;t have an answer for this but I</text><text start="1686.96" dur="4.02">feel like you know is there a sort of</text><text start="1689.419" dur="4.561">social architecture with that could be</text><text start="1690.98" dur="6.36">that could utilize web3 to help build</text><text start="1693.98" dur="5.16">the nodes of of the</text><text start="1697.34" dur="3.24">movement and the connections between</text><text start="1699.14" dur="3.659">those nodes</text><text start="1700.58" dur="3.42">um because it feels like we actually are</text><text start="1702.799" dur="4.321">all</text><text start="1704.0" dur="5.279">rooted in at some levels there&apos;s certain</text><text start="1707.12" dur="4.5">Universal principles I keep I come back</text><text start="1709.279" dur="4.201">to life and quality of life</text><text start="1711.62" dur="3.559">um as a kind of universal principle like</text><text start="1713.48" dur="4.199">we&apos;re all going to have different</text><text start="1715.179" dur="5.081">experiences of what quality of life</text><text start="1717.679" dur="3.781">means to us but if we can collectively</text><text start="1720.26" dur="3.6">say we actually want to create an</text><text start="1721.46" dur="3.959">economic system that that improves the</text><text start="1723.86" dur="3.9">well-being of people and communities</text><text start="1725.419" dur="5.161">then that creates at least some kind of</text><text start="1727.76" dur="4.2">a shared value system</text><text start="1730.58" dur="4.14">um and but then there&apos;s going to be a</text><text start="1731.96" dur="5.579">lot to metabolize to actually</text><text start="1734.72" dur="5.28">come into alignment as a larger movement</text><text start="1737.539" dur="4.14">together and so I don&apos;t have the answers</text><text start="1740.0" dur="4.08">for this but I&apos;m I&apos;m curious how</text><text start="1741.679" dur="4.681">technology might be able to scaffold the</text><text start="1744.08" dur="3.66">the process of depolarization and</text><text start="1746.36" dur="3.84">helping people find those shared value</text><text start="1747.74" dur="4.2">systems one of the things we talk about</text><text start="1750.2" dur="3.359">a lot when I was at git coin is this</text><text start="1751.94" dur="4.2">idea of cooperation across social</text><text start="1753.559" dur="5.1">distance so basically you know</text><text start="1756.14" dur="4.62">cooperation across distance is is is</text><text start="1758.659" dur="3.841">basically like if we&apos;re not in the same</text><text start="1760.76" dur="4.5">social network but we can still</text><text start="1762.5" dur="4.5">cooperate on on something and that&apos;s</text><text start="1765.26" dur="4.5">like the opposite of tribalism and being</text><text start="1767.0" dur="5.46">in our own little Echo Chambers and so</text><text start="1769.76" dur="4.74">you know I I think that that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="1772.46" dur="4.86">definitely one really component of</text><text start="1774.5" dur="6.0">Coalition building and in doing it</text><text start="1777.32" dur="4.859">across dowels across layer ones across</text><text start="1780.5" dur="3.6">tribes I think is a really important</text><text start="1782.179" dur="3.661">thing and and I think that maybe what</text><text start="1784.1" dur="4.98">we&apos;re building towards here is Nathan</text><text start="1785.84" dur="6.0">Schneider who&apos;s also an Xbox occupier</text><text start="1789.08" dur="4.26">who&apos;s uh web3 adjacent Now talks a lot</text><text start="1791.84" dur="3.36">about how</text><text start="1793.34" dur="4.62">in the web the web has gotten really</text><text start="1795.2" dur="5.219">good at disrupting power uh by creating</text><text start="1797.96" dur="5.4">protest but it hasn&apos;t really Gotten Good</text><text start="1800.419" dur="5.221">at holding power and and I think that</text><text start="1803.36" dur="5.039">that&apos;s maybe one maturation point that</text><text start="1805.64" dur="5.159">we really need to see is is creating</text><text start="1808.399" dur="6.481">systems that are stable and can hold</text><text start="1810.799" dur="7.38">power and still be legitimate in if if</text><text start="1814.88" dur="6.179">occupy was to move on to web3 rails and</text><text start="1818.179" dur="4.921">and it seems like occupy was really good</text><text start="1821.059" dur="3.061">at disrupting power</text><text start="1823.1" dur="2.76">um or at least creating a social</text><text start="1824.12" dur="3.36">movement that felt like it could disrupt</text><text start="1825.86" dur="3.179">power what would it look like to hold</text><text start="1827.48" dur="4.439">power as the generation that went</text><text start="1829.039" dur="5.341">through occupy uh matures is kind of the</text><text start="1831.919" dur="3.36">question at the tip of my tongue yeah I</text><text start="1834.38" dur="3.72">think that&apos;s a really interesting</text><text start="1835.279" dur="6.12">question I mean</text><text start="1838.1" dur="5.459">I think it rests on social coordination</text><text start="1841.399" dur="3.78">and a just a really a good example of</text><text start="1843.559" dur="3.061">where I felt like this happened just</text><text start="1845.179" dur="3.661">really beautifully and magically this</text><text start="1846.62" dur="3.539">fall this is just a very distinct thing</text><text start="1848.84" dur="1.92">that happened</text><text start="1850.159" dur="2.52">um</text><text start="1850.76" dur="3.6">the blockchain infrastructure

create together</text><text start="1884.539" dur="4.02">so</text><text start="1885.799" dur="4.62">I think part of power is being connected</text><text start="1888.559" dur="3.48">in community</text><text start="1890.419" dur="3.421">um and being willing to sort of take</text><text start="1892.039" dur="3.721">your boundaries down about being bigger</text><text start="1893.84" dur="3.9">better or best</text><text start="1895.76" dur="4.32">um but I also think power is money</text><text start="1897.74" dur="6.24">because money reflects contention and</text><text

dur="5.46">opportunity for me feels like how can we</text><text start="2607.24" dur="5.16">plant in the uh in the minds of of a</text><text start="2610.18" dur="4.02">hundred thousand digens this idea that</text><text start="2612.4" dur="4.439">the best yields come from going into</text><text start="2614.2" dur="4.2">regen web3 projects into the regen</text><text start="2616.839"

dur="3.18">something where they&apos;re going to lose</text><text start="2661.42" dur="4.62">their money and so connecting creating</text><text start="2663.64" dur="5.1">that connective tissue I think is is</text><text start="2666.04" dur="4.38">what feels like the work ahead of us so</text><text start="2668.74" dur="2.82">I don&apos;t know any reaction to that but</text><text start="2670.42" dur="3.48">that&apos;s at least how I&apos;m thinking about</text><text start="2671.56" dur="4.799">it it&apos;s interesting we&apos;re facing this</text><text start="2673.9" dur="4.86">right now with this campaign we have</text><text start="2676.359" dur="4.021">called cosmosero and the goal is just to</text><text start="2678.76" dur="3.0">get protocols and validators to take</text><text

here</text><text start="2685.599" dur="5.281">but what is getting people to</text><text start="2687.22" dur="5.58">participate is in climate altruism as I</text><text start="2690.88" dur="4.5">would describe it it&apos;s that there&apos;s</text><text start="2692.8" dur="4.74">going to be a liquid pool of carbon it&apos;s</text><text start="2695.38" dur="4.92">that there&apos;s gonna be rewards it&apos;s that</text><text start="2697.54" dur="5.22">they could do a native token Swap all of</text><text start="2700.3" dur="5.039">these financialization mechanisms and so</text><text start="2702.76" dur="5.16">I think we have to be as people inside</text><text start="2705.339" dur="4.801">the impact space unafraid to utilize</text><text start="2707.92" dur="4.62">capitalistic language in order to draw</text><text start="2710.14" dur="4.679">them in and I think we just have to come</text><text start="2712.54" dur="5.1">up with a better strategy of like</text><text start="2714.819" dur="4.5">cool degender regen is a meme but like</text><text start="2717.64" dur="4.56">how many people really care about that</text><text start="2719.319" dur="5.401">it&apos;s only us making fun of them and like</text><text start="2722.2" dur="4.8">isolating ourselves with that Meme I&apos;m</text><text start="2724.72" dur="5.84">more interested in like how do we really</text><text start="2727.0" dur="6.18">tell a financialization story for</text><text start="2730.56" dur="5.019">ecological systems and those social</text><text start="2733.18" dur="5.22">impact of those ecological systems</text><text start="2735.579" dur="4.74">because to me you know that single drum</text><text start="2738.4" dur="3.9">beat and this is what I look up to at</text><text start="2740.319" dur="5.101">occupied it&apos;s the gift that it gave me</text><text start="2742.3" dur="5.58">that keeps on giving is that the climate</text><text start="2745.42" dur="5.22">collapse is the only thing we&apos;re putting</text><text start="2747.88" dur="5.04">my time my energy and my money into and</text><text start="2750.64" dur="4.32">if I was so independently wealthy that I</text><text start="2752.92" dur="5.34">could fund everything I freaking would</text><text start="2754.96" dur="5.58">even if I only got one percent</text><text start="2758.26" dur="5.16">um but it&apos;s really a social Evolution</text><text start="2760.54" dur="5.34">it&apos;s really like a mental architecture</text><text start="2763.42" dur="3.36">Evolution that we have to be proactive</text><text start="2765.88" dur="2.699">about</text><text start="2766.78" dur="4.799">um that&apos;s why I always tell people I</text><text start="2768.579" dur="4.921">used to work for JP Morgan they take the</text><text start="2771.579" dur="4.681">conversation more seriously when they</text><text start="2773.5" dur="5.04">know I had all those licenses so I</text><text start="2776.26" dur="4.38">always lead with that because it disarms</text><text start="2778.54" dur="4.799">them and makes them realize that I was</text><text start="2780.64" dur="5.34">them but I chose to apply those skills</text><text start="2783.339" dur="4.441">to a different problem solutions that</text><text start="2785.98" dur="4.08">than necessarily the one that they have</text><text start="2787.78" dur="5.28">with their balance sheets and I&apos;m game</text><text start="2790.06" dur="4.74">so like we should do this not just talk</text><text start="2793.06" dur="2.519">about it but like find a way to do these</text><text start="2794.8" dur="3.299">things</text><text start="2795.579" dur="4.681">I I do have like one group of really</text><text start="2798.099" dur="4.561">close d-gen friends of mine and it&apos;s</text><text start="2800.26" dur="4.319">kind of rare for me uh</text><text start="2802.66" dur="5.419">to</text><text start="2804.579" dur="6.061">have that experience of like trying to</text><text start="2808.079" dur="4.481">instill or advocate for principles that</text><text start="2810.64" dur="3.86">really matter to me</text><text start="2812.56" dur="5.1">um but to feel like there&apos;s this kind of</text><text start="2814.5" dur="4.54">nihilism in the Degen space that&apos;s just</text><text start="2817.66" dur="5.76">like</text><text start="2819.04" dur="7.62">yeah cool like have you seen this like</text><text start="2823.42" dur="6.12">stick man it&apos;s the latest one that I&apos;m</text><text start="2826.66" dur="4.32">Shilling and</text><text start="2829.54" dur="4.02">it&apos;s been really hard for me because I&apos;m</text><text start="2830.98" dur="4.68">so Earnest it like actually required me</text><text start="2833.56" dur="4.44">to actually become</text><text start="2835.66" dur="4.08">to let go and be like okay if you guys</text><text start="2838.0" dur="4.02">want to do that I&apos;ll be over here</text><text start="2839.74" dur="5.46">building this stuff if you ever want to</text><text start="2842.02" dur="4.799">come hang out you&apos;re welcome to</text><text start="2845.2" dur="4.5">um and there&apos;s this real question of</text><text start="2846.819" dur="4.201">like what is value what is valuable</text><text start="2849.7" dur="3.659">um and then this sort of nihilistic</text><text start="2851.02" dur="5.4">d-gen space like well whatever</text><text start="2853.359" dur="5.101">anything can be valuable instead of like</text><text start="2856.42" dur="3.6">Community is valuable A Healthy Living</text><text start="2858.46" dur="3.659">Earth is viable and so I don&apos;t know how</text><text start="2860.02" dur="3.839">you make that bridge I think the bridge</text><text start="2862.119" dur="3.0">is being built this is just I&apos;m going to</text><text start="2863.859" dur="4.921">add some financialization information</text><text start="2865.119" dur="6.301">here one the SEC now requires um</text><text start="2868.78" dur="5.7">everything listed on the exchanges to</text><text start="2871.42" dur="5.22">report through EST and to truecarbon</text><text start="2874.48" dur="4.08">data information and really from a</text><text start="2876.64" dur="4.02">corporate sustainability and corporate</text><text start="2878.56" dur="3.96">finance perspective carbon is now an</text><text start="2880.66" dur="3.959">asset on the balance sheet the more</text><text start="2882.52" dur="3.72">pardon that goes on to the balance sheet</text><text start="2884.619" dur="3.301">which I actually think is the more</text><text start="2886.24" dur="3.599">important Financial intervention than</text><text start="2887.92" dur="3.96">companies offsetting the more and this</text><text start="2889.839" dur="3.721">is where I&apos;m totally on the same team as</text><text start="2891.88" dur="3.66">Gregory wholeheartedly admitting that</text><text start="2893.56" dur="4.2">out loud I do believe that as</text><text start="2895.54" dur="5.52">corporations and nation states put the</text><text start="2897.76" dur="5.579">value of ecology on balance sheets the</text><text start="2901.06" dur="4.62">system re-architects itself so to me</text><text start="2903.339" dur="4.141">that&apos;s like the Lynch pin in the</text><text start="2905.68" dur="4.5">situation that if you pull out the whole</text><text start="2907.48" dur="5.7">damn blows but that takes a long time</text><text start="2910.18" dur="4.86">for people to make brave choices at</text><text start="2913.18" dur="5.28">corporate levels and</text><text start="2915.04" dur="5.7">I think that looking at what is it that</text><text start="2918.46" dur="3.899">we value and how and why it&apos;s a</text><text start="2920.74" dur="3.78">conversation we need to have in a more</text><text start="2922.359" dur="4.621">mathematical and forthright fashion than</text><text start="2924.52" dur="6.0">we currently do we can&apos;t lead with hey</text><text start="2926.98" dur="6.0">climate Doom or hey impact good we need</text><text start="2930.52" dur="5.22">to lead with dollars and cents and be</text><text start="2932.98" dur="5.46">okay doing that because it transforms</text><text start="2935.74" dur="5.339">and compost Capital into the system that</text><text start="2938.44" dur="4.139">we think it ought to be but that drives</text><text start="2941.079" dur="3.721">from first principles</text><text start="2942.579" dur="4.981">as I go back to do we all have the same</text><text start="2944.8" dur="4.92">drum beat can we Define our principles</text><text start="2947.56" dur="3.48">and have multiple strategies to that aim</text><text start="2949.72" dur="3.119">depending on who you are and what you</text><text start="2951.04" dur="4.02">bring to the team yeah I don&apos;t think a</text><text start="2952.839" dur="3.901">web 3 is having the same drum beat maybe</text><text start="2955.06" dur="4.68">abusing your analogy but it feels like</text><text start="2956.74" dur="3.72">an orchestra uh in in you know as long</text><text start="2959.74" dur="2.46">as we&apos;re all playing different</text><text start="2960.46" dur="4.56">instruments and that there&apos;s a Sim</text><text start="2962.2" dur="5.58">there&apos;s a symphony that&apos;s developed uh</text><text start="2965.02" dur="3.839">between all of them then it feels good</text><text start="2967.78" dur="3.66">um</text><text start="2968.859" dur="4.201">yeah well so we only have four more</text><text start="2971.44" dur="4.379">minutes until the the bottom of the hour</text><text start="2973.06" dur="4.5">so I&apos;m wondering um if y&apos;all have</text><text start="2975.819" dur="3.961">anything that else else to say in</text><text start="2977.56" dur="3.9">closing and if there&apos;s anything that I</text><text start="2979.78" dur="3.74">didn&apos;t ask you that that you all want to</text><text start="2981.46" dur="2.06">say</text><text start="2985.0" dur="5.52">I I think the the</text><text start="2987.7" dur="4.44">I love the kind of the Paradox here</text><text start="2990.52" dur="5.28">because I think that there&apos;s something</text><text start="2992.14" dur="5.939">about the financialization of carbon and</text><text start="2995.8" dur="2.94">of social impact that</text><text start="2998.079" dur="3.181">um</text><text start="2998.74" dur="5.4">I think occupy did a better job than</text><text start="3001.26" dur="5.099">web3 has so far of questioning the</text><text start="3004.14" dur="3.26">underlying values systems of capitalism</text><text start="3006.359" dur="2.881">itself</text><text start="3007.4" dur="3.4">and</text><text start="3009.24" dur="3.0">um I don&apos;t want to go off on a whole</text><text start="3010.8" dur="4.559">tangent now but there&apos;s this notion of</text><text start="3012.24" dur="5.46">energy blindness uh Nate Haggins does an</text><text start="3015.359" dur="5.341">incredible work on this</text><text start="3017.7" dur="4.58">um that basically a large amount of the</text><text start="3020.7" dur="3.78">value that</text><text start="3022.28" dur="4.96">we&apos;re able to extract from the natural</text><text start="3024.48" dur="5.28">world is the product of millions of</text><text start="3027.24" dur="5.16">years of stored carbon in the ground and</text><text start="3029.76" dur="6.359">so we&apos;re actually taking from an energy</text><text start="3032.4" dur="5.939">store without replenishing it and so</text><text start="3036.119" dur="5.101">we&apos;ve basically created an inflated</text><text start="3038.339" dur="4.621">value system where we think we can make</text><text start="3041.22" dur="4.26">things for cheaper than we actually can</text><text start="3042.96" dur="3.96">because we&apos;re not factoring in the</text><text start="3045.48" dur="3.18">amount the millions of years that it</text><text start="3046.92" dur="3.72">took for that carbon to become in that</text><text start="3048.66" dur="3.6">form and so it feels like we&apos;re actually</text><text start="3050.64" dur="4.199">running up against like a very material</text><text start="3052.26" dur="4.079">structural wall around value</text><text start="3054.839" dur="3.361">and</text><text start="3056.339" dur="3.901">and I think that could be a really rude</text><text start="3058.2" dur="3.3">awakening for a lot of people</text><text start="3060.24" dur="3.24">um when we start when it starts to</text><text start="3061.5" dur="4.02">become harder to extract that energy and</text><text start="3063.48" dur="4.02">energy costs go up and then costs of</text><text start="3065.52" dur="4.62">everything go up and so I think we&apos;re in</text><text start="3067.5" dur="5.16">this very narrow window right now where</text><text start="3070.14" dur="4.439">um we&apos;re not being forced to radically</text><text start="3072.66" dur="3.48">change those value systems but I think</text><text start="3074.579" dur="3.48">we will be</text><text start="3076.14" dur="3.12">um and so I don&apos;t know that we&apos;re going</text><text start="3078.059" dur="3.421">to need to make as much of the</text><text start="3079.26" dur="4.02">financialization argument</text><text start="3081.48" dur="4.26">um once it becomes really clear that</text><text start="3083.28" dur="4.14">we&apos;ve so vastly extended beyond the</text><text start="3085.74" dur="3.78">carrying capacity of the earth that</text><text start="3087.42" dur="4.679">we&apos;re no longer able to produce things</text><text start="3089.52" dur="4.98">at the cost that we currently have been</text><text start="3092.099" dur="5.281">and that&apos;s just going to send so many</text><text start="3094.5" dur="4.7">different things into a totally chaotic</text><text start="3097.38" dur="4.62">systems</text><text start="3099.2" dur="5.02">chaos before they recalibrate to a new a</text><text start="3102.0" dur="4.559">new Basin and</text><text start="3104.22" dur="3.839">um and so yeah I would love to see more</text><text start="3106.559" dur="4.081">like deeper conversations about the</text><text start="3108.059" dur="3.841">nature of value in the web 3 space and I</text><text start="3110.64" dur="3.36">appreciate this conversation like</text><text start="3111.9" dur="6.0">bringing that ethos like back into my</text><text start="3114.0" dur="6.42">awareness it&apos;s a really good point</text><text start="3117.9" dur="3.959">I think I want to leave everyone with a</text><text start="3120.42" dur="3.36">little bit of hope that this is going to</text><text start="3121.859" dur="3.541">be better suited for those that are able</text><text

some real art from occupy</text><text start="3130.5" dur="4.74">I would like to show you</text><text start="3132.78" dur="5.1">um because I am a hoarder of you know</text><text start="3135.24" dur="4.859">important historical artifacts from the</text><text start="3137.88" dur="3.92">journey oh yeah and I want to make some</text><text start="3140.099" dur="7.561">points so</text><text

dur="5.881">that front line is women</text><text start="3158.88" dur="5.939">and I think here in web 3 we need to</text><text start="3162.24" dur="5.4">have more women more non-verinary people</text><text start="3164.819" dur="5.221">more people of color using these tools</text><text start="3167.64" dur="5.28">with us because occupations and</text><text start="3170.04"
