the Pod we</text><text start="7.08" dur="5.4">have peace who is working on metagame</text><text start="10.139" dur="5.761">what is metagame it is you can kind of</text><text start="12.48" dur="6.059">think of it as an MMORPG interface to</text><text start="15.9" dur="4.08">exploring the web 3 and the crypto world</text><text start="18.539" dur="3.061">so basically people come through this</text><text start="19.98" dur="3.9">front door and they see several</text><text start="21.6" dur="4.5">different houses a house of finance a</text><text start="23.88" dur="3.84">house of regen and they can go explore</text><text start="26.1" dur="4.019">different quests within those different</text><text start="27.72" dur="4.2">houses and which they can explore</text><text start="30.119" dur="3.661">explore the web 3 ecosystem so it&apos;s kind</text><text start="31.92" dur="5.52">of like an onboarding tool to the web3</text><text start="33.78" dur="5.279">ecosystem that itself as you get deeper</text><text start="37.44" dur="3.54">into it gets you deeper into the web 3</text><text start="39.059" dur="5.16">ecosystem but also can get you into</text><text start="40.98" dur="4.919">deeper into building metagame and so</text><text start="44.219" dur="4.02">basically it&apos;s kind of this infinite</text><text start="45.899" dur="4.5">game in which it teaches people about</text><text start="48.239" dur="4.8">the philosophy and the ethos and the</text><text start="50.399" dur="4.68">tools associated with web3 but when you</text><text start="53.039" dur="3.901">talk to Pete you just get this this sort</text><text start="55.079" dur="4.14">of sense of attention between being a</text><text start="56.94" dur="4.02">philosopher and being a builder uh puth</text><text start="59.219" dur="3.66">is an entrepreneur working in the web</text><text start="60.96" dur="4.199">threesome him and I actually met at East</text><text start="62.879" dur="4.081">Berlin in 2019 and I&apos;ve seen the growth</text><text start="65.159" dur="4.5">of metagame from just a Discord server</text><text start="66.96" dur="5.159">into this community that&apos;s thriving and</text><text start="69.659" dur="5.28">is trying to create a more game B world</text><text start="72.119" dur="4.441">so basically game B is this idea that</text><text start="74.939" dur="3.061">you may recognize from the episodes that</text><text start="76.56" dur="4.8">we&apos;ve done with Daniel schmachtenberger</text><text start="78.0" dur="6.06">about creating a omniwind civilization</text><text start="81.36" dur="4.02">that maximizes human flourishing uh</text><text start="84.06" dur="3.419">maximizing collective intelligence</text><text start="85.38" dur="4.02">coordination collaboration Omni</text><text start="87.479" dur="5.161">consideration</text><text start="89.4" dur="4.56">um these are all provocations that are</text><text start="92.64" dur="3.659">meant to provoke the idea that we&apos;re</text><text start="93.96" dur="4.799">playing a game a that is more molokian</text><text start="96.299" dur="4.14">that is more about defecting and</text><text start="98.759" dur="3.0">maximizing resources for yourselves as</text><text start="100.439" dur="3.901">opposed to creating an omni win</text><text start="101.759" dur="5.161">Civilization and so game B has become</text><text start="104.34" dur="5.4">this really interesting Philosophy for</text><text start="106.92" dur="4.86">me that has sort of provoked a lot of</text><text start="109.74" dur="3.54">these questions about what if we what</text><text start="111.78" dur="3.72">you know what if the internet of Finance</text><text start="113.28" dur="3.9">was emergent how would you build a game</text><text start="115.5" dur="3.84">B that is more different that is a</text><text start="117.18" dur="4.56">little bit different than the existing</text><text start="119.34" dur="4.44">system that has been inherited from the</text><text start="121.74" dur="3.839">previous generation and so you know</text><text start="123.78" dur="3.839">there&apos;s some of those provocations in</text><text start="125.579" dur="4.141">the conversation with metagame it&apos;s</text><text start="127.619" dur="6.541">about routing talent and capital in web</text><text start="129.72" dur="6.72">3 to projects but it&apos;s also about if you</text><text start="134.16" dur="4.38">look at it at a systemic level in MMORPG</text><text start="136.44" dur="4.62">that routes talent and capital in this</text><text start="138.54" dur="4.26">more game B Direction so</text><text start="141.06" dur="3.6">um I I think that metagame is going to</text><text start="142.8" dur="4.439">be an iterative evolutionary game as is</text><text start="144.66" dur="5.28">web3 but it&apos;s kind of interesting to</text><text start="147.239" dur="6.36">talk to peace on the week of metagame V1</text><text start="149.94" dur="7.08">launch about his plans for metagame and</text><text start="153.599" dur="5.701">also the becoming of a Dao and uh the</text><text start="157.02" dur="4.14">launch of metagame V1 so interesting</text><text start="159.3" dur="4.2">episode a really timely one like I said</text><text start="161.16" dur="3.719">I&apos;ve been talking to Pete since

something how many</text><text start="436.199" dur="3.301">how many Divergent paths are there</text><text start="437.639" dur="3.601">because I mean I think there&apos;s web3 is</text><text start="439.5" dur="3.24">just this kind of like infinite Frontier</text><text start="441.24" dur="3.6">of different things that you can do with</text><text start="442.74" dur="4.44">money in with

so</text><text start="457.919" dur="3.601">the first one is just like the we call</text><text start="459.9" dur="3.6">this the great houses so we have like</text><text start="461.52" dur="4.38">the house of ethereum that explains the</text><text start="463.5" dur="4.38">basics of what ethereum is and then</text><text start="465.9" dur="4.5">sends you off in different like has a</text><text start="467.88" dur="5.7">list of links to learn more and then we</text><text start="470.4" dur="7.26">have the house of daos the house of nfts</text><text start="473.58" dur="5.399">uh Defiance and the house of depths and</text><text start="477.66" dur="3.72">so these great houses are really about</text><text start="478.979" dur="4.021">like giving you the sort of a meta</text><text start="481.38" dur="4.259">overview of the different fields of</text><text start="483.0" dur="5.039">interest and then uh like just a bunch</text><text start="485.639" dur="5.641">of links to like explore further like</text><text start="488.039" dur="5.94">like that post the podcast whatever else</text><text start="491.28" dur="5.16">to learn about these different domains</text><text start="493.979" dur="3.901">cool is there a house of regen you know</text><text start="496.44" dur="3.599">say I&apos;m green pill than I want to learn</text><text start="497.88" dur="5.039">about pro-social causes of web3 which</text><text start="500.039" dur="4.681">houses is the best one to start in not</text><text start="502.919" dur="3.421">yet but there definitely should be it so</text><text start="504.72" dur="3.78">I think one of the next ones I want to</text><text start="506.34" dur="3.539">build is the house of game change and</text><text start="508.5" dur="4.32">that I want to include like all the</text><text start="509.879" dur="5.52">region stuff the game B stuff</text><text start="512.82" dur="5.159">you know the meta modernism and like all</text><text start="515.399" dur="5.82">those more philosophical topics but I</text><text start="517.979" dur="5.94">think refi fits right in and also we&apos;ll</text><text start="521.219" dur="5.341">include some more notes of about rifa in</text><text start="523.919" dur="4.261">the house of D5</text><text start="526.56" dur="4.86">cool</text><text start="528.18" dur="4.14">um yeah that would be great I uh we</text><text start="531.42" dur="2.58">could call it maybe the house of</text><text start="532.32" dur="3.66">coordination I think that&apos;s a meme that</text><text start="534.0" dur="4.32">you and I have talked a lot about when</text><text start="535.98" dur="3.479">you&apos;re not recording so is there uh you</text><text start="538.32" dur="2.34">know once you&apos;re in the house and you&apos;ve</text><text start="539.459" dur="3.06">kind of established yourself you&apos;ve done</text><text start="540.66" dur="3.38">a couple initial quests is there a</text><text start="542.519" dur="4.26">leveling up system I&apos;m thinking of</text><text start="544.04" dur="4.9">MMORPGs where you start as a mage and</text><text start="546.779" dur="4.381">then you learn all of these more skills</text><text start="548.94" dur="5.7">and you gather more loot as as you go on</text><text start="551.16" dur="5.6">so what is the progression from from</text><text start="554.64" dur="5.1">joining the house look like from there</text><text start="556.76" dur="5.019">I&apos;ll joining becomes like the this is</text><text start="559.74" dur="4.08">just exploration phase still so like</text><text start="561.779" dur="3.961">people go to explore houses and then</text><text start="563.82" dur="4.26">they can report their findings so like</text><text start="565.74" dur="4.98">so that&apos;s a quest to like report what</text><text start="568.08" dur="5.04">they found or what they learned but the</text><text start="570.72" dur="4.2">the leveling up really starts when you</text><text start="573.12" dur="3.719">choose the path to join metagame and</text><text start="574.92" dur="4.44">that splits to like join as a player or</text><text start="576.839" dur="4.44">join as a patron or join as a guild</text><text start="579.36" dur="4.32">and player is like the the most popular</text><text start="581.279" dur="5.161">pet for like learning and contributing</text><text start="583.68" dur="4.86">to metagame patrons are just people who</text><text start="586.44" dur="4.62">are supporting metagame financially and</text><text start="588.54" dur="4.38">then guilds are different dials that</text><text start="591.06" dur="3.899">might want to join the network and</text><text start="592.92" dur="3.9">integrate their own like uh</text><text start="594.959" dur="4.32">successorially different building blocks</text><text start="596.82" dur="4.62">that they&apos;re building into the metaos</text><text start="599.279" dur="4.981">which we can get into a bit more later</text><text start="601.44" dur="4.26">but yeah so once you choose the player</text><text start="604.26" dur="3.24">path then it really starts the</text><text start="605.7" dur="4.56">onboarding to metagame which starts with</text><text start="607.5" dur="4.62">eight quests that are called the engaged</text><text start="610.26" dur="3.54">octopath which is the first role that</text><text start="612.12" dur="3.36">you get in metagame so like you prove</text><text start="613.8" dur="3.659">that you&apos;re not a bot and then you</text><text start="615.48" dur="3.78">become an Engaged doctor so it means</text><text start="617.459" dur="4.081">that you&apos;re on the onboarding journey to</text><text start="619.26" dur="4.62">John meridian so you complete these</text><text start="621.54" dur="4.38">quests and then that sends you to like</text><text start="623.88" dur="4.139">uh the pet selection screen where you</text><text start="625.92" dur="3.419">like choose different paths based on the</text><text start="628.019" dur="3.841">role that you want to take so there&apos;s</text><text start="629.339" dur="5.401">like a builder&apos;s path designers pets and</text><text start="631.86" dur="5.22">a few other pets that people might want</text><text start="634.74" dur="4.32">to take there&apos;s also like a create your</text><text start="637.08" dur="5.1">own path so like people are not forced</text><text start="639.06" dur="5.64">to take these pets like they can like</text><text start="642.18" dur="5.159">create their own path</text><text start="644.7" dur="4.8">but yeah so like then you complete more</text><text start="647.339" dur="4.921">quests and then if you&apos;re accepted you</text><text start="649.5" dur="5.88">become a player and then the more active</text><text start="652.26" dur="4.86">you get you rise up the leaderboard</text><text start="655.38" dur="4.079">there are</text><text start="657.12" dur="6.42">so there are 150 players in total like</text><text start="659.459" dur="6.301">that&apos;s the cap currently the top 56 are</text><text start="663.54" dur="3.539">What&apos;s called the ranked players and</text><text start="665.76" dur="4.5">there you have like the bronze League</text><text start="667.079" dur="5.521">silverlink silver league uh gold league</text><text start="670.26" dur="5.1">platinum and diamond</text><text start="672.6" dur="4.979">so you like rise up those leagues and uh</text><text start="675.36" dur="3.659">each league has their own uh perks that</text><text start="677.579" dur="3.961">you unlock</text><text start="679.019" dur="5.401">and then yeah as you get uh more active</text><text start="681.54" dur="5.039">you can become a deputy or a champion so</text><text start="684.42" dur="4.8">these are like the the leaders of</text><text start="686.579" dur="4.681">different uh initiatives or domains</text><text start="689.22" dur="4.08">inside metagame so that&apos;s another like</text><text start="691.26" dur="4.44">level of involvement</text><text start="693.3" dur="6.2">and that&apos;s where you join the coordinate</text><text start="695.7" dur="5.6">Circle and there are additional Rewards</text><text start="699.5" dur="4.66">yeah</text><text start="701.3" dur="6.94">so so first off uh I think you and I met</text><text start="704.16" dur="6.119">at youth Berlin in maybe 2019 2020 was</text><text start="708.24" dur="3.659">it and it could have been 2020 because</text><text start="710.279" dur="2.821">of the coveted pandemic but I remember</text><text start="711.899" dur="4.5">you telling me all these different ideas</text><text start="713.1" dur="6.0">about Medicaid they&apos;re like kind of like</text><text start="716.399" dur="4.62">it was just it was it was a it was this</text><text start="719.1" dur="3.96">big Vision that you&apos;re trying to compact</text><text start="721.019" dur="3.721">down into something that&apos;s approachable</text><text start="723.06" dur="3.779">and understandable by people and I think</text><text start="724.74" dur="4.02">that you&apos;ve come a long way in sort of</text><text start="726.839" dur="4.141">explaining what this is but I always</text><text start="728.76" dur="4.319">feel like as a as a viewer I need a</text><text start="730.98" dur="4.74">visual overview and I know that if you</text><text start="733.079" dur="4.081">go to metagame.wtf uh which is where the</text><text start="735.72" dur="3.6">experience is hosted you can kind of</text><text start="737.16" dur="4.679">visualize all the different paths down</text><text start="739.32" dur="3.959">and nooks and crannies of metagame so</text><text start="741.839" dur="3.781">it&apos;s just been cool to follow the</text><text start="743.279" dur="4.381">progression of this project over the</text><text start="745.62" dur="4.2">last couple years and such an honor to</text><text start="747.66" dur="5.46">talk about it as the V1 is launching</text><text start="749.82" dur="4.38">literally this week so uh Kudos on all</text><text start="753.12" dur="3.959">the traction</text><text start="754.2" dur="4.86">yeah thank you yeah like things finally</text><text start="757.079" dur="3.961">actually exist I remember like reaching</text><text start="759.06" dur="3.66">out to you like even before we met in</text><text start="761.04" dur="3.9">Berlin like hey what do you think about</text><text start="762.72" dur="4.919">this idea and it&apos;s like just such a huge</text><text start="764.94" dur="4.56">idea it&apos;s like people that I sent it to</text><text start="767.639" dur="4.44">most of them were like dude you can&apos;t</text><text start="769.5" dur="5.22">just do all of that like choose one</text><text start="772.079" dur="5.7">thing yeah yeah</text><text start="774.72" dur="4.679">um together right yeah in the end it fit</text><text start="777.779" dur="4.141">together I think like in some ways we</text><text start="779.399" dur="4.321">started like uh we built some pieces</text><text start="781.92" dur="3.06">that should have been built last we</text><text start="783.72" dur="3.059">built the first like the my meta</text><text start="784.98" dur="3.84">profiles which are these sort of a</text><text start="786.779" dur="3.421">decentralized LinkedIn Pages for the</text><text start="788.82" dur="3.66">people who want to work in the dial</text><text start="790.2" dur="5.28">space so like that&apos;s our first product</text><text start="792.48" dur="4.5">when actually probably was supposed to</text><text start="795.48" dur="3.72">be our like we were supposed to be</text><text start="796.98" dur="3.96">building it now and instead of that like</text><text start="799.2" dur="3.42">we&apos;ve built that first so the whole</text><text start="800.94" dur="3.3">onboarding flow was broken like the</text><text start="802.62" dur="3.48">onboarding quest didn&apos;t exist the</text><text start="804.24" dur="4.92">onboarding game didn&apos;t exist we just</text><text start="806.1" dur="7.2">okay create a profile now go to Discord</text><text start="809.16" dur="6.419">and that was the the whole flow but yeah</text><text start="813.3" dur="4.74">like over time I think finally all these</text><text start="815.579" dur="4.801">pieces are in place and we have the the</text><text start="818.04" dur="4.56">functional platform</text><text start="820.38" dur="3.72">yeah that&apos;s great I noticed that you</text><text start="822.6" dur="3.78">called metagame a massively online</text><text start="824.1" dur="4.5">coordination game as opposed to a</text><text start="826.38" dur="3.44">massively online role-playing game and I</text><text start="828.6" dur="4.34">thought that was an interesting</text><text start="829.82" dur="5.74">distinction and maybe you know as</text><text start="832.94" dur="4.06">someone who just thinks a lot about web3</text><text start="835.56" dur="3.18">error coordination and collective</text><text start="837.0" dur="3.839">intelligence I&apos;m reading too much of the</text><text start="838.74" dur="3.659">tea leaves here but it feels like to me</text><text start="840.839" dur="3.661">something like World of Warcraft or a</text><text start="842.399" dur="4.44">role-playing game is is a fun</text><text start="844.5" dur="3.42">entertaining experience but in at the</text><text start="846.839" dur="2.761">end of the day it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="847.92" dur="3.599">Escapist in that like the loot that you</text><text start="849.6" dur="4.2">get is only good within World of</text><text start="851.519" dur="4.32">Warcraft and the experience can only be</text><text start="853.8" dur="3.479">experienced within that one little like</text><text start="855.839" dur="3.841">intranet</text><text start="857.279" dur="4.74">um and with metagame what&apos;s cool is that</text><text start="859.68" dur="5.94">it&apos;s kind of turning web 3 the</text><text start="862.019" dur="5.221">exploration of web 3 into a a</text><text start="865.62" dur="3.899">coordination game a massively online</text><text start="867.24" dur="3.779">role-playing coordination game and</text><text start="869.519" dur="3.301">what&apos;s cool about that is that the</text><text start="871.019" dur="2.88">assets that you acquire and the skills</text><text start="872.82" dur="3.72">and friendships you acquire actually</text><text start="873.899" dur="4.201">like professionally relevant so I don&apos;t</text><text start="876.54" dur="3.419">know if that was a purposefully</text><text start="878.1" dur="3.72">purposeful message thing that you&apos;re</text><text start="879.959" dur="3.781">doing there but I think taking some of</text><text start="881.82" dur="4.319">the MMORPG mechanics and applying them</text><text start="883.74" dur="5.219">to web3 is a really interesting idea and</text><text start="886.139" dur="4.861">and can&apos;t wait to see where that goes</text><text start="888.959" dur="4.921">yeah definitely so one of the things</text><text start="891.0" dur="4.26">that uh that helped me and the impact on</text><text start="893.88" dur="3.3">me was this this thing called the</text><text start="895.26" dur="4.86">octolysis framework which was built by</text><text start="897.18" dur="5.04">this guy that was like uh big gamer but</text><text start="900.12" dur="4.32">also studied like behavioral economics</text><text start="902.22" dur="4.44">and sociology and I don&apos;t know what what</text><text start="904.44" dur="4.68">else he studied but he came up in the</text><text start="906.66" dur="4.799">end with this octolysis framework which</text><text start="909.12" dur="3.36">basically split uh like these different</text><text start="911.459" dur="4.081">uh</text><text start="912.48" dur="6.24">reasons why people love games in general</text><text start="915.54" dur="4.859">so like own having ownership having</text><text start="918.72" dur="4.979">agency I don&apos;t know it splits like into</text><text start="920.399" dur="6.24">these eight different things and the all</text><text start="923.699" dur="4.5">successful games hit up like at least a</text><text start="926.639" dur="4.081">few of those things like they can you</text><text start="928.199" dur="4.681">know like uh there&apos;s a meaning making</text><text start="930.72" dur="3.9">and things like that</text><text start="932.88" dur="4.139">but the thing is like with all games</text><text start="934.62" dur="4.8">it&apos;s still all virtual like you said</text><text start="937.019" dur="4.021">like you&apos;re like you&apos;re you&apos;re leveling</text><text start="939.42" dur="4.14">up in your unlocking achievements and</text><text start="941.04" dur="5.58">all that but it&apos;s still low like in this</text><text start="943.56" dur="5.399">game world and same with the World of</text><text start="946.62" dur="4.32">Warcraft like all of them all of those</text><text start="948.959" dur="4.38">games hit like a combination of these</text><text start="950.94" dur="4.62">elements but metagame has potential to</text><text start="953.339" dur="4.021">hit all eight of them because it&apos;s like</text><text start="955.56" dur="3.3">it&apos;s actually like you are leveling up</text><text start="957.36" dur="3.479">but you&apos;re leveling up like in the real</text><text start="958.86" dur="3.9">world like you&apos;re acquiring skills</text><text start="960.839" dur="4.021">learning things and progressing through</text><text start="962.76" dur="5.939">organizations</text><text start="964.86" dur="5.82">I think that&apos;s super important</text><text start="968.699" dur="4.38">so I know that you&apos;re launching this</text><text start="970.68" dur="4.8">week by the time this episode airs the</text><text start="973.079" dur="3.961">experience will be live at metagame.wtf</text><text start="975.48" dur="3.539">so go check that out if you&apos;re listening</text><text start="977.04" dur="3.9">but you know Pete what would a</text><text start="979.019" dur="3.841">successful launch look like for you I</text><text start="980.94" dur="5.22">think you said there&apos;s a cap of 150</text><text start="982.86" dur="6.659">players what is what is sort of the rest</text><text start="986.16" dur="5.58">of 2022 and early 2023 look like for</text><text start="989.519" dur="3.961">metagame are you are the people that are</text><text start="991.74" dur="4.02">coming into metagame once they get more</text><text start="993.48" dur="5.279">advanced building meta game uh like the</text><text start="995.76" dur="4.259">next trance of of metagame and I guess</text><text start="998.759" dur="3.061">I&apos;m just asking what&apos;s next over the</text><text start="1000.019" dur="3.901">next six months</text><text start="1001.82" dur="5.1">uh so over the next six months there</text><text start="1003.92" dur="4.56">will be a lot of uh more boring stuff so</text><text start="1006.92" dur="3.96">like restructuring the dial and</text><text start="1008.48" dur="4.44">launching it on Dao house like uh</text><text start="1010.88" dur="4.44">finalizing the tokenomics for phase two</text><text start="1012.92" dur="3.839">since we&apos;ll be like transitioning in</text><text start="1015.32" dur="4.439">less than a year</text><text start="1016.759" dur="4.801">and that sort of stuff but what I want</text><text start="1019.759" dur="3.721">to focus on in terms of the platform in</text><text start="1021.56" dur="4.619">terms of the meta OS is really going</text><text start="1023.48" dur="4.439">hard on the Integrations so like making</text><text start="1026.179" dur="4.38">the dashboard and the whole Matos</text><text start="1027.919" dur="4.14">experience a lot more useful and</text><text start="1030.559" dur="3.541">integrate a lot of different building</text><text start="1032.059" dur="3.961">blocks which is actually the idea from</text><text start="1034.1" dur="3.239">the beginning and but then like most of</text><text start="1036.02" dur="2.399">the things that are in there are things</text><text start="1037.339" dur="3.181">that we build</text><text start="1038.419" dur="4.26">yeah but uh yeah so like you have the</text><text start="1040.52" dur="3.659">dashboard which displays uh the latest</text><text start="1042.679" dur="4.26">content from the community the</text><text start="1044.179" dur="4.801">leaderboard the calendar your XP and</text><text start="1046.939" dur="4.86">token stats and I don&apos;t know what else</text><text start="1048.98" dur="5.46">but we want to like also to integrate</text><text start="1051.799" dur="4.681">things like okay what uh what tasks are</text><text start="1054.44" dur="4.32">assigned to your ethereum address on</text><text start="1056.48" dur="6.3">different like Bounty networks or like</text><text start="1058.76" dur="5.7">the D work or like uh to like surface</text><text start="1062.78" dur="4.08">proposals from the dials that you&apos;re a</text><text start="1064.46" dur="4.86">member of and different things like that</text><text start="1066.86" dur="4.02">so like really want to yeah make this is</text><text start="1069.32" dur="4.56">possible for people to create these</text><text start="1070.88" dur="5.64">custom blocks in the dashboard and like</text><text start="1073.88" dur="4.679">build their own Integrations</text><text start="1076.52" dur="4.38">so metal is really meant to be this</text><text start="1078.559" dur="4.381">Mosaic of different uh web3 building</text><text start="1080.9" dur="5.34">blocks yeah I think that you said the</text><text start="1082.94" dur="6.18">the different types of users are the</text><text start="1086.24" dur="3.96">users the guilds and the patrons so I</text><text start="1089.12" dur="4.439">wonder if you know if you can make it</text><text start="1090.2" dur="5.099">all self-service for users and uh guilds</text><text start="1093.559" dur="3.721">and patrons to maintain their own part</text><text start="1095.299" dur="3.721">of the journey then the whole thing just</text><text start="1097.28" dur="4.259">kind of grows frantically according to</text><text start="1099.02" dur="5.279">those experiences obviously easier said</text><text start="1101.539" dur="4.861">than done but uh it reminds me a lot of</text><text start="1104.299" dur="4.021">when we decided to turn company uh get</text><text start="1106.4" dur="5.159">coin from a company into a dollar let&apos;s</text><text start="1108.32" dur="6.359">get coin grants the experience of making</text><text start="1111.559" dur="5.101">it so that the matching funders and the</text><text start="1114.679" dur="4.021">individual funders and the grant owners</text><text start="1116.66" dur="3.6">like they&apos;re different parts of the</text><text start="1118.7" dur="4.62">hyperstructure that all sort of interact</text><text start="1120.26" dur="4.919">with the with the smart contract uh so</text><text start="1123.32" dur="3.66">so it seems like that refactor there it</text><text start="1125.179" dur="3.781">just it just brings up a memory of me of</text><text start="1126.98" dur="5.88">doing that at Bitcoin</text><text start="1128.96" dur="6.48">great yeah yeah and it&apos;s really like a</text><text start="1132.86" dur="4.38">long term what I want to marry him to be</text><text start="1135.44" dur="4.38">like so like that&apos;s why from the</text><text start="1137.24" dur="3.96">beginning I created this like at least I</text><text start="1139.82" dur="3.96">attempted to create this separation</text><text start="1141.2" dur="4.8">between uh metaphem as an organization</text><text start="1143.78" dur="4.5">that started metagame and the metagame</text><text start="1146.0" dur="4.74">itself as a project and then as we</text><text start="1148.28" dur="5.42">transition to phase two I see like us</text><text start="1150.74" dur="6.24">just being one of many guilds that are</text><text start="1153.7" dur="5.8">building that again that&apos;s cool yeah</text><text start="1156.98" dur="5.939">so using metagame to build metagame in a</text><text start="1159.5" dur="5.1">way right take us uh okay so I asked the</text><text start="1162.919" dur="4.741">what&apos;s in the next six months question</text><text start="1164.6" dur="5.64">and now I want to telescope further into</text><text start="1167.66" dur="5.16">the future take us to the year 2033</text><text start="1170.24" dur="4.14">which is about 10 years from now what</text><text start="1172.82" dur="3.359">does metagame look like if it&apos;s</text><text start="1174.38" dur="4.46">maximally successful and what impact has</text><text start="1176.179" dur="2.661">it had on the world</text><text start="1180.76" dur="4.779">in phase three what we&apos;re calling the uh</text><text start="1184.039" dur="3.841">the phase should be called the Web of</text><text start="1185.539" dur="4.321">Life uh and it should really be about</text><text start="1187.88" dur="4.08">you know the phase is called equilibrium</text><text start="1189.86" dur="3.84">but the meme is the web of life so like</text><text start="1191.96" dur="3.36">the right now the meme is the an</text><text start="1193.7" dur="3.719">onboarding machine and a decentralized</text><text start="1195.32" dur="4.68">factory so it&apos;s about onboarding people</text><text start="1197.419"

of Life where</text><text start="1209.6" dur="4.26">it&apos;s like really a zoomed out of crypto</text><text start="1211.64" dur="3.96">where crypto is really just the one of</text><text start="1213.86" dur="4.439">many tools that we&apos;re using and it&apos;s</text><text start="1215.6" dur="4.56">really at the core of what we built but</text><text start="1218.299" dur="4.861">it&apos;s like marigame is not about crypto</text><text start="1220.16" dur="4.92">it&apos;s about helping people find the the</text><text start="1223.16" dur="4.86">most optimal ways to play life like for</text><text start="1225.08" dur="4.68">themselves and to make an impact so like</text><text start="1228.02" dur="4.279">at that point meta game should be this</text><text start="1229.76" dur="5.22">huge network of uh people and projects</text><text start="1232.299" dur="4.481">together with the physical locations</text><text start="1234.98" dur="3.78">that we actually

start="1261.26" dur="4.38">beautiful so I mean it feels like it&apos;s a</text><text start="1264.08" dur="3.599">way to discover the opportunities in web</text><text start="1265.64" dur="4.08">3 but as web3 eats the world it kind of</text><text start="1267.679" dur="4.321">becomes a way to just like level up your</text><text start="1269.72" dur="3.66">skills and your relationships and</text><text

the wide diverse</text><text start="1278.48" dur="4.26">Divergent things in web3 and so maybe</text><text start="1281.12" dur="3.48">you can find opportunities in people</text><text start="1282.74" dur="3.48">that align more with your values and it</text><text start="1284.6" dur="3.72">helps route you to where the most value</text><text start="1286.22" dur="4.14">is but I mean how do you think about the</text><text start="1288.32" dur="4.68">player testing or like the balance</text><text start="1290.36" dur="3.96">testing of that like you know if I&apos;m</text><text start="1293.0" dur="6.84">someone who&apos;s trying to decide if I want</text><text start="1294.32" dur="8.52">to go into Finance or uh regen stuff or</text><text start="1299.84" dur="4.86">nft flipping you know like the balancing</text><text start="1302.84" dur="3.3">of all those different routes like how</text><text start="1304.7" dur="3.0">do you guide the user down all those</text><text start="1306.14" dur="5.279">different paths it feels like there&apos;s so</text><text start="1307.7" dur="5.339">many Divergent Divergent uh parts of web</text><text start="1311.419" dur="3.541">3 and the world that they could be</text><text start="1313.039" dur="4.861">exploring at that scale</text><text start="1314.96" dur="5.64">yeah I think it&apos;s at the end of the day</text><text start="1317.9" dur="5.7">like I mean further versions it stops</text><text start="1320.6" dur="5.34">being less about start being less about</text><text start="1323.6" dur="4.079">us guiding them and more about</text><text start="1325.94" dur="3.78">discovering your own path so like</text><text start="1327.679" dur="3.301">there&apos;s these basic path that you take</text><text start="1329.72" dur="4.5">for joining and contributing to</text><text start="1330.98" dur="5.88">numerican specifically but this uh</text><text start="1334.22" dur="5.04">questions and this project we&apos;re calling</text><text start="1336.86" dur="4.02">playbooks is really like what it Forks</text><text start="1339.26" dur="3.299">into where people create these different</text><text start="1340.88" dur="3.48">paths and you can actually already find</text><text start="1342.559" dur="3.541">people like on Twitter posting these</text><text start="1344.36" dur="4.26">different threads that are about</text><text start="1346.1" dur="4.5">uh doing useful things for joining the</text><text start="1348.62" dur="3.84">web 3 space things like that that&apos;s also</text><text start="1350.6" dur="4.26">what we want to focus on is just trying</text><text start="1352.46" dur="4.199">to get people from the general web3</text><text start="1354.86" dur="2.64">space or like not just web3 but in</text><text start="1356.659" dur="2.941">general</text><text start="1357.5" dur="4.32">uh to write these uh playbooks and</text><text start="1359.6" dur="5.28">create their own Quest chains so</text><text start="1361.82" dur="4.62">questions is the the first Dao that came</text><text start="1364.88" dur="4.2">out of metagame so like the first</text><text start="1366.44" dur="4.44">Standalone project that&apos;s used for like</text><text start="1369.08" dur="3.9">to begin with creating this uh</text><text start="1370.88" dur="3.96">onboarding Journeys and it&apos;s made in</text><text start="1372.98" dur="4.38">such a way that people can integrate</text><text start="1374.84" dur="5.52">into their own platforms so you like</text><text start="1377.36" dur="5.16">there&apos;s this uh you create you complete</text><text start="1380.36" dur="4.62">this Quest chain so like a sequence of</text><text start="1382.52" dur="4.62">quests and you unlock an nft</text><text start="1384.98" dur="4.62">and then yes we&apos;re using it to for</text><text start="1387.14" dur="4.919">onboarding people but it can be also be</text><text start="1389.6" dur="4.5">used for like uh micro courses it can</text><text start="1392.059" dur="4.261">eventually be used for building skill</text><text start="1394.1" dur="4.62">trees because like with one nft you can</text><text start="1396.32" dur="3.18">unlock another question and things like</text><text start="1398.72" dur="2.819">that</text><text start="1399.5" dur="4.679">so you&apos;ll see a lot of people uh</text><text start="1401.539" dur="5.701">creating their own paths and then like</text><text start="1404.179" dur="5.841">creating these uh playbooks out of that</text><text start="1407.24" dur="4.799">and then people like filtering and</text><text start="1410.02" dur="4.3">browsing through these playbooks and</text><text start="1412.039" dur="5.041">seeing what works for them</text><text start="1414.32" dur="5.88">Hmm got it so it becomes kind of like an</text><text start="1417.08" dur="5.099">interface for Discovery uh for the users</text><text start="1420.2" dur="5.28">and at scale hopefully there&apos;s a broad</text><text start="1422.179" dur="4.86">diverse uh and inclusive set of</text><text start="1425.48" dur="3.48">opportunities that that people can</text><text start="1427.039" dur="3.661">discover and you know it feels like at</text><text start="1428.96" dur="3.719">that level you know projecting out 10</text><text start="1430.7" dur="3.9">years in which this becomes a way for</text><text start="1432.679" dur="3.24">people to to do one of the most</text><text start="1434.6" dur="4.079">important things of their lives which is</text><text start="1435.919" dur="4.74">build skills and build up their balance</text><text start="1438.679" dur="3.421">and discover their purpose like the</text><text start="1440.659" dur="5.821">governance rights to that become</text><text start="1442.1" dur="6.0">somewhat important so uh so when Dao</text><text start="1446.48" dur="4.38">for metagame</text><text start="1448.1" dur="4.5">I mean we hear the dial from well not</text><text start="1450.86" dur="4.38">from day one but we started on Aragon</text><text start="1452.6" dur="4.26">but the reason we refused to use it is</text><text start="1455.24" dur="4.439">because like we studied on arrogance</text><text start="1456.86" dur="5.58">because didn&apos;t support a minting of</text><text start="1459.679" dur="5.88">tokens but we never wanted metagame to</text><text start="1462.44" dur="5.099">be like token weighted voting so like we</text><text start="1465.559" dur="4.201">were minting the tokens on Aragon but we</text><text start="1467.539" dur="4.801">never used the Aragon for voting besides</text><text start="1469.76" dur="6.06">actually minting tokens so like voting</text><text start="1472.34" dur="5.94">on minting and uh like until now</text><text start="1475.82" dur="4.62">metagame basically just been uh one</text><text start="1478.28" dur="5.399">person one vote or hopefully one person</text><text start="1480.44" dur="7.619">at this a big part of the reason why we</text><text start="1483.679" dur="7.38">limited 250 players so that&apos;s like uh</text><text start="1488.059" dur="5.1">less trying to fight the Bots and uh</text><text start="1491.059" dur="3.421">like build up a single resistance and</text><text start="1493.159" dur="3.841">more like trying to build this</text><text start="1494.48" dur="4.319">tight-knit community where you know that</text><text start="1497.0" dur="5.58">like each of these people is a unique</text><text start="1498.799" dur="6.961">human and that&apos;s deserves the one human</text><text start="1502.58" dur="5.579">one vote for the like voting in metagame</text><text start="1505.76" dur="5.1">and then earlier with restructuring it</text><text start="1508.159" dur="4.321">and uh like launching a new tower will</text><text start="1510.86" dur="3.6">actually be voting on chain rather than</text><text start="1512.48" dur="3.9">in a Discord Channel which is kind of</text><text start="1514.46" dur="3.959">embarrassing at this point but yeah</text><text start="1516.38" dur="2.88">there was no a better and simpler</text><text start="1518.419" dur="3.841">solution</text><text start="1519.26" dur="5.519">but at that point I want to transition</text><text start="1522.26" dur="5.34">more into a system where people can earn</text><text start="1524.779" dur="4.321">multiple votes so they can like maybe</text><text start="1527.6" dur="3.36">like with each season that they are</text><text start="1529.1" dur="4.319">active in metagame they get uh one</text><text start="1530.96" dur="4.199">additional vote and then also like so</text><text start="1533.419" dur="4.26">there will be different scales for like</text><text start="1535.159" dur="5.52">how players unlock additional votes and</text><text start="1537.679" dur="4.761">how patrons unlock different votes so it</text><text start="1540.679" dur="4.321">still won&apos;t be like uh</text><text start="1542.44" dur="5.44">based on how much money you have but</text><text start="1545.0" dur="5.4">like a lot of different</text><text start="1547.88" dur="5.039">a lot of different uh things so it&apos;s</text><text start="1550.4" dur="3.84">that&apos;s like super important important</text><text start="1552.919" dur="3.721">for me from day one like if you&apos;re</text><text start="1554.24" dur="6.679">building this whole new world like it</text><text start="1556.64" dur="4.279">cannot be a plutocracy it&apos;s just yeah</text><text start="1561.02" dur="3.899">weird well uh you know I hear you you</text><text start="1562.82" dur="3.359">sing in the song of civil resistance uh</text><text start="1564.919" dur="3.541">a little bit with this one human one</text><text start="1566.179" dur="4.86">vote stuff I wonder if there&apos;s any way</text><text start="1568.46" dur="4.079">that uh the people out there get coined</text><text start="1571.039" dur="3.181">out in their work on get coin passport</text><text start="1572.539" dur="4.38">could derive civil resistance from</text><text start="1574.22" dur="4.14">metagame and vice versa so we&apos;ll just</text><text start="1576.919" dur="4.14">put that idea out there into the</text><text start="1578.36" dur="4.86">universe and um you know as listeners</text><text start="1581.059" dur="3.541">know I&apos;ve used civil resistance as a</text><text start="1583.22" dur="3.12">huge opportunity for the space to go</text><text start="1584.6" dur="3.66">from one token one vote to one human one</text><text start="1586.34" dur="3.839">vote and however we can make that happen</text><text start="1588.26" dur="4.68">I&apos;m very supportive</text><text start="1590.179" dur="5.341">yeah yeah yeah I met one of your</text><text start="1592.94" dur="5.4">people who was working on that at temcon</text><text start="1595.52" dur="4.92">and they talked to him about like how uh</text><text start="1598.34" dur="5.16">when I was starting we we also use</text><text start="1600.44" dur="5.04">ceramic but when I went to make my git</text><text start="1603.5" dur="6.539">coin passport it actually didn&apos;t detect</text><text start="1605.48" dur="5.52">my existing uh ceramic uh profile so we</text><text start="1610.039" dur="3.541">need to</text><text start="1611.0" dur="4.38">get that working somehow at least</text><text start="1613.58" dur="3.719">and then from that like we have like the</text><text start="1615.38" dur="3.96">down memberships and we&apos;ll be adding</text><text start="1617.299" dur="3.48">more stuff that could be useful for the</text><text start="1619.34" dur="3.9">passport as well</text><text start="1620.779" dur="6.241">okay I wanted to have our own uh like uh</text><text start="1623.24" dur="6.48">calling it a metapass it&apos;s like a old</text><text start="1627.02" dur="4.08">lady of like just uh receiving this</text><text start="1629.72" dur="3.9">passport based on like if you&apos;re a</text><text start="1631.1" dur="5.4">member of at least one doll that&apos;s a</text><text start="1633.62" dur="5.28">member of metagame then you can get it</text><text start="1636.5" dur="4.26">got it okay yeah so maybe there&apos;s an</text><text start="1638.9" dur="5.34">opportunity there it seems like ceramic</text><text start="1640.76" dur="6.0">is where a lot of the web 3 reputation</text><text start="1644.24" dur="3.36">off-chain web3 reputation stuff is going</text><text

it to talk to</text><text start="1650.72" dur="3.24">each other is is something that&apos;s going</text><text start="1652.7" dur="2.28">to have to be consciously planned it</text><text start="1653.96" dur="3.36">seems like</text><text start="1654.98" dur="4.439">yeah and they&apos;re transitioning to the</text><text start="1657.32" dur="3.719">new graphs graph structure and</text><text start="1659.419" dur="3.481">apparently making it a lot more</text><text start="1661.039" dur="3.12">composable so that should</text><text start="1662.9" dur="3.96">help</text><text start="1664.159"

of teach people new</text><text start="1851.12" dur="5.64">primitive show them a new ecosystem</text><text start="1853.58" dur="5.819">every day and then those atomic habits</text><text start="1856.76" dur="6.06">compound over time into a real knowledge</text><text start="1859.399" dur="5.76">of web3 and it in retrospect it feels</text><text start="1862.82" dur="4.979">like you know a lot but if you just</text><text start="1865.159" dur="5.161">learn one bit every little day then I</text><text start="1867.799" dur="4.321">think that it really breaks down some of</text><text start="1870.32" dur="3.599">the onboarding problems in the space so</text><text start="1872.12" dur="3.24">curious to see how that works with</text><text start="1873.919" dur="2.821">metagame and also I know that there&apos;s</text><text start="1875.36" dur="2.819">kind of like a social layer on your</text><text start="1876.74" dur="3.299">Discord I&apos;ve been on your Discord before</text><text

onboard people as well so what is</text><text start="1884.059" dur="4.98">what is the sort of social layer of of</text><text start="1886.88" dur="5.1">metagame look like uh do you guys do</text><text start="1889.039" dur="5.041">Town Halls on on Discord is is it mostly</text><text start="1891.98" dur="3.179">centered around Discord what does that</text><text start="1894.08" dur="3.3">look like</text><text start="1895.159" dur="4.441">yeah so far it&apos;s been mostly on Discord</text><text start="1897.38" dur="4.98">so we had the community calls every</text><text start="1899.6" dur="4.079">Friday where usually we had two guests</text><text start="1902.36" dur="3.96">so like uh</text><text start="1903.679" dur="4.86">we invited the two Dallas per Community</text><text start="1906.32" dur="3.66">call and then we had two of those people</text><text start="1908.539" dur="2.701">present their Dallas and what they&apos;re</text><text start="1909.98" dur="3.9">working on</text><text start="1911.24" dur="4.679">so that was happening every Friday up</text><text start="1913.88" dur="3.72">until like a month ago</text><text start="1915.919" dur="4.321">and that&apos;s been happening for a long</text><text start="1917.6" dur="5.16">time and yeah we have other like uh</text><text start="1920.24" dur="4.74">Builders called like uh Builders online</text><text start="1922.76" dur="4.919">that&apos;s like a weekly Builders call</text><text start="1924.98" dur="3.96">and we have the other Champions ring</text><text start="1927.679" dur="2.941">which is for people who are leading</text><text start="1928.94" dur="3.599">these different initiatives</text><text start="1930.62" dur="4.22">but yeah like mostly happening on</text><text start="1932.539" dur="2.301">Discord</text><text start="1935.179" dur="2.941">well I think that we&apos;re getting close to</text><text start="1936.62" dur="3.179">time is there anything I didn&apos;t ask that</text><text start="1938.12" dur="5.46">you want to tell us about metagame</text><text start="1939.799" dur="6.301">I guess just uh like the inspiration for</text><text start="1943.58" dur="4.86">starting the whole thing it kind of</text><text start="1946.1" dur="3.439">didn&apos;t uh really go into that but yeah</text><text start="1948.44" dur="4.08">like even</text><text start="1949.539" dur="5.681">you want to say something</text><text start="1952.52" dur="4.92">let&apos;s go there let&apos;s do it</text><text start="1955.22" dur="4.319">uh so like before crypto what I was</text><text start="1957.44" dur="4.979">really into is like researching this uh</text><text start="1959.539" dur="5.101">this like uh different sort of uh</text><text start="1962.419" dur="4.021">society different sort of social social</text><text start="1964.64" dur="3.659">socio-economic systems I don&apos;t know like</text><text start="1966.44" dur="3.78">initially what I started with was the</text><text start="1968.299" dur="4.081">watching the Zeitgeist documentaries</text><text start="1970.22" dur="4.62">that was like 10 years ago and like now</text><text start="1972.38" dur="4.44">that I watch them it&apos;s they&apos;re kind of</text><text start="1974.84" dur="5.219">cringe but they made a lot of impact on</text><text start="1976.82" dur="5.459">me when I was uh like in high school</text><text start="1980.059" dur="3.961">and they like really set me on this path</text><text start="1982.279" dur="3.481">of researching these different like Eco</text><text start="1984.02" dur="4.74">Villages and that sort of like</text><text start="1985.76" dur="5.7">self-sustainable uh places and in</text><text start="1988.76" dur="4.74">general like researching uh different uh</text><text start="1991.46" dur="4.26">economic system different political</text><text start="1993.5" dur="4.38">structures and that sort of stuff and</text><text start="1995.72" dur="4.199">then when I found ethereum is like</text><text start="1997.88" dur="5.039">like okay so like this is the softer</text><text start="1999.919" dur="5.581">layer like for building any like these</text><text start="2002.919" dur="4.321">new kinds of uh social economic systems</text><text start="2005.5" dur="3.539">and that&apos;s really what drew me into</text><text start="2007.24" dur="3.659">ethereum that&apos;s what was like really so</text><text start="2009.039" dur="2.76">deep into the dark space from the</text><text start="2010.899" dur="4.26">beginning</text><text start="2011.799" dur="5.161">and then yeah a few years later I joined</text><text start="2015.159" dur="3.541">the metacartel Dao which at the time</text><text start="2016.96" dur="4.98">like even though house didn&apos;t exist yet</text><text start="2018.7" dur="5.339">so we just uh front-end for voting and</text><text start="2021.94" dur="5.04">the treasury management it was like</text><text start="2024.039" dur="3.841">super basic and the telegram group and I</text><text start="2026.98" dur="3.78">was like</text><text start="2027.88" dur="4.98">okay so I joined now like who are these</text><text start="2030.76" dur="3.36">people what are the projects what can I</text><text start="2032.86" dur="3.539">do what&apos;s going on like I didn&apos;t</text><text start="2034.12" dur="3.72">understand anything so I started working</text><text start="2036.399" dur="3.421">on this thing that I was calling the</text><text start="2037.84" dur="4.319">medical black paper</text><text start="2039.82" dur="5.4">and then as I was developing this whole</text><text start="2042.159" dur="4.26">structure like the more I was thinking</text><text start="2045.22" dur="3.06">like if we were building this whole</text><text start="2046.419" dur="4.081">system it doesn&apos;t make sense to build it</text><text start="2048.28" dur="4.26">just for this one Dao and it&apos;s like a</text><text start="2050.5" dur="3.78">project that pretty much there is a</text><text start="2052.54" dur="3.9">problem that pretty much any doubt has</text><text start="2054.28" dur="3.839">like any there won&apos;t even many dollars</text><text start="2056.44" dur="3.959">at the time but like well then we had</text><text start="2058.119" dur="5.161">onboarding problems and there&apos;s a huge</text><text start="2060.399" dur="4.561">like onboarding problem for the web3</text><text start="2063.28" dur="3.899">space in general and like helping people</text><text start="2064.96" dur="5.159">understand you know like what crypto is</text><text start="2067.179" dur="6.0">about besides the number go up</text><text start="2070.119" dur="6.901">and that&apos;s what we like uh made me start</text><text start="2073.179" dur="5.761">mating so like yeah put they say wind in</text><text start="2077.02" dur="4.92">my back like starting with this niche of</text><text start="2078.94" dur="4.26">onboarding people to web3 but really</text><text start="2081.94" dur="2.88">like</text><text start="2083.2" dur="3.719">putting it together with everything that</text><text start="2084.82" dur="4.38">I ever wanted to build which is uh yeah</text><text start="2086.919" dur="4.68">a new kind of uh socioeconomic system</text><text start="2089.2" dur="4.74">like finally enabled yeah this is the</text><text start="2091.599" dur="4.02">Webster Technologies and yeah hopefully</text><text start="2093.94" dur="3.899">Inspire others to</text><text start="2095.619" dur="4.201">think along the same lines</text><text start="2097.839" dur="4.741">one of the things that sort of strikes</text><text start="2099.82" dur="4.38">me when I hear that story and also just</text><text start="2102.58" dur="3.36">thinking back to meeting you at youth</text><text start="2104.2" dur="4.32">Berlin in 2019 when you had all those</text><text start="2105.94" dur="5.04">crazy ideas and</text><text start="2108.52" dur="4.26">um is is how metagame is kind of just</text><text start="2110.98" dur="5.4">like it feels like a fractal of</text><text start="2112.78" dur="6.36">metacartel in in a way to me uh how</text><text start="2116.38" dur="5.16">Peter Pan and the other ogs at</text><text start="2119.14" dur="5.939">metacartel kind of did this cohort based</text><text start="2121.54" dur="5.52">onboarding of uh the ecosystem and</text><text start="2125.079" dur="3.961">originally meta cartel started off as</text><text start="2127.06" dur="3.6">this meta transaction working group and</text><text start="2129.04" dur="4.26">then it evolved into a social network</text><text start="2130.66" dur="4.32">and then you coming in as kind of its</text><text start="2133.3" dur="3.24">resident philosopher I don&apos;t put words</text><text start="2134.98" dur="3.9">in your mouth but that&apos;s how I perceive</text><text start="2136.54" dur="3.6">you uh and then and then kind trying to</text><text start="2138.88" dur="2.82">switch to play that forward okay this</text><text start="2140.14" dur="2.699">was my path forward into web three and</text><text start="2141.7" dur="3.419">for making an impact in the world how do</text><text start="2142.839" dur="4.141">I pay that forward to other people in</text><text start="2145.119" dur="3.96">the world and so just the relationship</text><text start="2146.98" dur="3.78">between metacartel and then metagame and</text><text start="2149.079" dur="4.081">then whatever comes next from the next</text><text start="2150.76" dur="4.26">cohort that&apos;s onboarded from that feels</text><text start="2153.16" dur="5.34">like a very interesting fractal thing to</text><text start="2155.02" dur="6.12">me yeah yeah I mean even America till</text><text start="2158.5" dur="5.04">kind of started because uh Peter Pan was</text><text start="2161.14" dur="4.74">denied entry into molok Dao so like then</text><text start="2163.54" dur="3.96">America tell came to be and then from</text><text start="2165.88" dur="4.199">America told Kim metagame and now</text><text start="2167.5" dur="4.44">metagame spawned the like Quest chains</text><text start="2170.079" dur="3.721">like it&apos;s owned out and then hopefully</text><text start="2171.94" dur="4.44">at some point question will spawn</text><text start="2173.8" dur="5.46">another though and like so um for</text><text start="2176.38" dur="4.199">actualizes further yeah and the other</text><text start="2179.26" dur="3.72">thing that&apos;s really cool to me is the</text><text start="2180.579" dur="5.04">like the super modularity of these</text><text start="2182.98" dur="3.84">ecosystems so basically the idea of</text><text start="2185.619" dur="3.781">super modularity is having each</text><text start="2186.82" dur="4.74">composite part be modular in that it&apos;s</text><text start="2189.4" dur="3.6">self-contained but the super modularity</text><text start="2191.56" dur="3.24">is that the sum is greater than the</text><text start="2193.0" dur="5.94">whole of its parts and so just having</text><text start="2194.8" dur="7.26">been involved in metagame and metacartel</text><text start="2198.94" dur="5.58">and being from my perch over get coin</text><text start="2202.06" dur="4.38">while I was there just seeing the</text><text start="2204.52" dur="3.059">interoperability between all of these</text><text start="2206.44" dur="3.3">different sister projects in the</text><text start="2207.579" dur="4.141">metacartel ecosystem and then the sister</text><text start="2209.74" dur="3.72">projects between git coin and kernel and</text><text start="2211.72" dur="3.6">the hackathons over on the get coin side</text><text start="2213.46" dur="3.96">of things and then they interop with the</text><text start="2215.32" dur="4.5">rest of the ecosystem that I saw at</text><text start="2217.42" dur="4.56">metacom this year in Denver was really</text><text start="2219.82" dur="3.84">neat and and so it&apos;s not just onboarding</text><text start="2221.98" dur="5.58">people into web 3 but there&apos;s all these</text><text start="2223.66" dur="5.34">little like camps that are are there for</text><text start="2227.56" dur="3.539">the ethos and the coordination</text><text start="2229.0" dur="3.48">technology that we&apos;re building and can</text><text start="2231.099" dur="4.02">kind of bond together and I think that</text><text start="2232.48" dur="4.26">that&apos;s another another piece of the</text><text start="2235.119" dur="3.121">metagame that&apos;s that&apos;s super important</text><text start="2236.74" dur="3.0">and then in a way that&apos;s kind of your</text><text start="2238.24" dur="3.72">business at metagame is to help people</text><text start="2239.74" dur="4.14">on board into these different modules</text><text start="2241.96" dur="2.879">that are all socially interoperable with</text><text start="2243.88" dur="3.06">each other</text><text start="2244.839" dur="3.541">great we had to onboard into this</text><text start="2246.94" dur="3.419">network of dollars and yeah somebody</text><text start="2248.38" dur="3.84">told me like well but this onboarding</text><text start="2250.359" dur="3.421">game like why is it sending people to so</text><text start="2252.22" dur="3.66">many different directions instead of</text><text start="2253.78" dur="4.2">like funneling them into into America</text><text start="2255.88" dur="4.14">and I was like yeah like it&apos;s better</text><text start="2257.98" dur="3.78">give me just part of this ecosystem like</text><text start="2260.02" dur="3.42">if they need to go to Radio they should</text><text start="2261.76" dur="3.66">go to Radio they need to like go to</text><text start="2263.44" dur="3.24">Dallas they go to dollhouse like they</text><text start="2265.42" dur="3.96">need to discover all of these different</text><text start="2266.68" dur="4.74">uh guilds that they can join and like</text><text start="2269.38" dur="3.84">join these different communities based</text><text start="2271.42" dur="3.84">on their interest not because of like</text><text start="2273.22" dur="4.379">you came to our landing page so now join</text><text start="2275.26" dur="4.98">like our Dao</text><text start="2277.599" dur="4.321">yeah yeah I think it&apos;s neat the the</text><text start="2280.24" dur="3.54">reason why it&apos;s so Divergent is that web</text><text start="2281.92" dur="3.54">3 is so Divergent and there&apos;s this</text><text start="2283.78" dur="3.66">infinite Garden this infinite Frontier</text><text start="2285.46" dur="4.74">of different things that people can</text><text start="2287.44" dur="4.44">learn in the space so uh I think it&apos;s</text><text start="2290.2" dur="3.18">it&apos;s neat to give people a little bit of</text><text start="2291.88" dur="3.78">guard rails as they go in those</text><text start="2293.38" dur="4.02">directions and you know because it&apos;s a</text><text start="2295.66" dur="4.02">frontier there&apos;s there&apos;s rattlesnakes</text><text start="2297.4" dur="4.14">there&apos;s tarantulas that can bite you uh</text><text start="2299.68" dur="3.899">and keeping people away from the scams</text><text start="2301.54" dur="3.84">and towards the projects that have the</text><text start="2303.579" dur="4.321">Good Vibes I think is a really hard</text><text start="2305.38" dur="6.36">curation task that I&apos;m curious to see</text><text start="2307.9" dur="6.3">how metagame as it evolves keeps that it</text><text start="2311.74" dur="4.26">keeps keeps that ethos and and scales it</text><text start="2314.2" dur="4.86">so uh congrats on all the success</text><text start="2316.0" dur="5.04">congrats on all the launch and and and</text><text start="2319.06" dur="4.14">looking forward to seeing how it goes so</text><text start="2321.04" dur="3.6">uh where can people find metagame and</text><text start="2323.2" dur="4.44">find you online</text><text start="2324.64" dur="3.0">metagame.wtf</text><text start="2328.24" dur="4.02">and then yeah if you want to build your</text><text start="2330.22" dur="4.139">own metagame consider looking into metal</text><text start="2332.26" dur="5.76">game and seeing the the post about the</text><text start="2334.359" dur="6.061">meta OS like building this uh Mosaic of</text><text start="2338.02" dur="5.28">web3 building blocks you should also</text><text start="2340.42" dur="6.659">consider coming to metafest IRL so it&apos;s</text><text start="2343.3" dur="5.4">finally happening next summer Croatia</text><text start="2347.079" dur="4.141">it should be fun</text><text start="2348.7" dur="4.68">and I want to
