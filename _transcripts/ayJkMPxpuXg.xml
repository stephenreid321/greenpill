dur="3.68">pod and to talk about your most recent</text><text start="221.92" dur="2.64">work so</text><text start="223.12" dur="4.24">uh tell me about evolutionary</text><text start="224.56" dur="5.12">organization</text><text start="227.36" dur="3.92">yeah um so i guess a little bit of</text><text start="229.68" dur="4.24">context on where evolutionary</text><text start="231.28" dur="6.159">organizations came from</text><text start="233.92" dur="6.959">i was at dao nyc talking with john</text><text start="237.439" dur="5.601">hillis from cabin and a few other um</text><text start="240.879" dur="4.0">people who are just sort of building and</text><text start="243.04" dur="4.32">operating in the space</text><text start="244.879" dur="3.92">and it it really started to come up this</text><text start="247.36" dur="3.599">idea of</text><text start="248.799" dur="3.681">gaul&apos;s law which i actually had never</text><text start="250.959" dur="4.56">heard of but it&apos;s</text><text start="252.48" dur="5.999">basically this principle that complex</text><text start="255.519" dur="4.96">organizations can only evolve from</text><text start="258.479" dur="3.44">organizations that came before them that</text><text start="260.479" dur="2.481">were simpler</text><text start="261.919" dur="3.761">and</text><text start="262.96" dur="4.88">it really stuck with me because i think</text><text start="265.68" dur="4.799">sometimes in the dow ecosystem and</text><text start="267.84" dur="5.04">crypto more broadly we try to design</text><text start="270.479" dur="4.16">these like incredibly complex systems</text><text start="272.88" dur="3.12">whether that be to economics incentive</text><text start="274.639" dur="2.241">systems whatever</text><text start="276.0" dur="2.32">and</text><text start="276.88" dur="3.039">when you try to do that from the start</text><text start="278.32" dur="4.24">you&apos;re usually going to end up with</text><text start="279.919" dur="4.401">systems that kind of suck for a variety</text><text start="282.56" dur="2.8">of reasons one of the big ones is just</text><text start="284.32" dur="3.36">that</text><text start="285.36" dur="3.92">any sufficiently complex system makes a</text><text start="287.68" dur="4.4">set of assumptions</text><text start="289.28" dur="4.8">that you&apos;re basically designing for so</text><text start="292.08" dur="4.32">you think people need to act in x-way</text><text start="294.08" dur="4.64">and so you then create an incentive</text><text start="296.4" dur="4.32">mechanism to incentivize that type of</text><text start="298.72" dur="3.919">behavior and the more of those you</text><text start="300.72" dur="3.84">include you just start to build this</text><text start="302.639" dur="3.521">like massive system that you have no</text><text start="304.56" dur="2.72">idea if it&apos;s even solving the right</text><text start="306.16" dur="3.12">problems</text><text start="307.28" dur="4.88">and so something that we&apos;ve talked a lot</text><text start="309.28" dur="4.479">about at orca is like flexibility of</text><text start="312.16" dur="2.879">organizations and all that stuff and so</text><text start="313.759" dur="2.801">we really started to think about how can</text><text start="315.039" dur="3.6">we build these evolutionary</text><text start="316.56" dur="3.28">organizations that abide by gaul&apos;s law</text><text start="318.639" dur="2.881">where you sort of say we&apos;re going to</text><text start="319.84" dur="4.48">evolve from a simpler</text><text start="321.52" dur="6.32">system into a more complex one test our</text><text start="324.32" dur="5.04">assumptions constantly and then see what</text><text start="327.84" dur="3.84">works for us and that doesn&apos;t mean like</text><text start="329.36" dur="5.36">ignoring all of the stuff that we&apos;ve</text><text start="331.68" dur="5.6">learned in the history of humankind</text><text start="334.72" dur="5.68">organizing but it does mean not trying</text><text start="337.28" dur="5.359">to overly engineer something when it</text><text start="340.4" dur="4.72">just doesn&apos;t make sense right that&apos;s so</text><text start="342.639" dur="4.081">beautiful i mean i think that</text><text start="345.12" dur="4.0">it seems like it&apos;s just a recognition of</text><text start="346.72" dur="4.08">reality for you so gaul&apos;s law is that</text><text start="349.12" dur="3.04">complex organizations can only emerge</text><text start="350.8" dur="3.44">from simpler organ</text><text start="352.16" dur="3.52">ecosystems and then</text><text start="354.24" dur="2.72">basically recognizing that means</text><text start="355.68" dur="2.4">recognizing that we don&apos;t have perfect</text><text start="356.96" dur="2.48">foresight there&apos;s going to be</text><text start="358.08" dur="3.44">information that we need to acquire into</text><text start="359.44" dur="3.84">the system design that we do not know at</text><text start="361.52" dur="3.28">the front of it so just launch something</text><text start="363.28" dur="3.44">simple and then iterate towards</text><text start="364.8" dur="3.839">something more complicated</text><text start="366.72" dur="4.56">and in an evolutionary sort of like</text><text start="368.639" dur="4.0">epoch way do you think that it&apos;s better</text><text start="371.28" dur="3.84">to have the clock speed on that</text><text start="372.639" dur="4.721">evolutionary iteration</text><text start="375.12" dur="3.919">uh longer clock speed or a shorter talk</text><text start="377.36" dur="5.04">clock speed like are we evolving daily</text><text start="379.039" dur="5.361">weekly quarterly yearly</text><text start="382.4" dur="2.88">this is a fun that&apos;s a good question i</text><text start="384.4" dur="2.72">think</text><text start="385.28" dur="3.039">when i think about what gaul&apos;s law means</text><text start="387.12" dur="3.519">in practice and how you build</text><text start="388.319" dur="4.401">evolutionary organizations i think</text><text start="390.639" dur="4.081">depending on what it is that you&apos;re</text><text start="392.72" dur="3.919">testing you want to have different time</text><text start="394.72" dur="4.319">frames for it so</text><text start="396.639" dur="4.161">a good example of this that john from</text><text start="399.039" dur="3.28">cabin has talked quite a bit about</text><text start="400.8" dur="3.28">publicly is</text><text start="402.319" dur="4.081">the evolution of their resource</text><text start="404.08" dur="4.08">allocation system so they started with</text><text start="406.4" dur="4.639">having people who were basically like</text><text start="408.16" dur="4.72">full-time cabin or who they</text><text start="411.039" dur="3.28">paid basically to say you&apos;re gonna do</text><text start="412.88" dur="2.8">work here</text><text start="414.319" dur="3.6">you&apos;ll figure out what that work is and</text><text start="415.68" dur="3.76">then they did another version um i can&apos;t</text><text start="417.919" dur="3.68">remember what exactly that version</text><text start="419.44" dur="3.92">looked like i think it was um maybe it</text><text start="421.599" dur="3.681">was project based and now they&apos;re on to</text><text start="423.36" dur="3.679">a new version so that made sense to do</text><text start="425.28" dur="4.72">over probably like six month time</text><text start="427.039" dur="4.401">horizons maybe it was three months um</text><text start="430.0" dur="3.44">i think when you&apos;re doing things like</text><text start="431.44" dur="3.28">that where you need to test out and you</text><text start="433.44" dur="2.879">have an experiment that lasts for a</text><text start="434.72" dur="3.44">certain amount of time that totally</text><text start="436.319" dur="4.72">makes sense um if you&apos;re doing something</text><text start="438.16" dur="4.879">like communication uh styles and things</text><text start="441.039" dur="4.401">like that it probably makes sense to do</text><text start="443.039" dur="3.681">that faster rather than like waiting six</text><text start="445.44" dur="3.199">months to see if you and i are</text><text start="446.72" dur="3.36">effectively communicating so i think it</text><text start="448.639" dur="3.68">really depends on what structure you&apos;re</text><text start="450.08" dur="4.0">talking about and um how easy it is to</text><text start="452.319" dur="4.32">change and how much data you actually</text><text start="454.08" dur="4.399">want on whether or not it&apos;s working</text><text start="456.639" dur="3.601">got it um</text><text start="458.479" dur="3.521">yeah i i think that you&apos;re right you</text><text start="460.24" dur="3.76">want to have the clock speed match this</text><text start="462.0" dur="3.599">sort of market or system that you&apos;re</text><text start="464.0" dur="4.24">trying to study and probably have it be</text><text start="465.599" dur="4.961">as fast as possible as is possible for</text><text start="468.24" dur="3.84">that that ecosystem like you&apos;re studying</text><text start="470.56" dur="3.359">the bull bear cycle the super cycle you</text><text start="472.08" dur="4.08">can only get data every four years but</text><text start="473.919" dur="4.0">if you&apos;re studying at a much faster</text><text start="476.16" dur="2.96">cycle you can you can probably cycle</text><text start="477.919" dur="2.96">things faster</text><text start="479.12" dur="3.519">is that fair</text><text start="480.879" dur="4.16">yeah exactly and actually i think it</text><text start="482.639" dur="3.84">gets into you get into a really</text><text start="485.039" dur="2.641">uh something i&apos;ve been thinking more</text><text start="486.479" dur="2.16">about that i think is really interesting</text><text start="487.68" dur="2.88">which is</text><text start="488.639" dur="4.481">it&apos;s actually kind of hard sometimes to</text><text start="490.56" dur="4.8">tell when you need to end the iteration</text><text start="493.12" dur="4.4">of an experiment like once you have the</text><text start="495.36" dur="5.2">momentum it&apos;s actually</text><text start="497.52" dur="5.359">a little bit too easy to keep with that</text><text start="500.56" dur="4.88">version as opposed to saying let&apos;s</text><text start="502.879" dur="4.88">bookend this and try something new</text><text start="505.44" dur="4.64">acknowledging</text><text start="507.759" dur="4.4">yeah exactly so i think there&apos;s also</text><text start="510.08" dur="4.079">something really interesting to trying</text><text start="512.159" dur="3.44">to kind of define those things up front</text><text start="514.159" dur="2.88">and say in three months we&apos;re going to</text><text start="515.599" dur="4.081">reassess this</text><text start="517.039" dur="5.281">not because it needs to be like</text><text start="519.68" dur="5.12">perfect but we need to acknowledge when</text><text start="522.32" dur="4.639">maybe it&apos;s time for something new</text><text start="524.8" dur="3.76">yeah um it&apos;s hard for me to hear this</text><text start="526.959" dur="3.201">talk and and not relate it back to my</text><text start="528.56" dur="3.44">own experience building git coin over</text><text start="530.16" dur="3.84">the last five years i mean we basically</text><text start="532.0" dur="4.399">launched it the goal was to grow open</text><text start="534.0" dur="3.76">source software and the first experiment</text><text start="536.399" dur="3.201">that we sort of aimed at that product</text><text start="537.76" dur="3.68">market fit was doing bounties which is</text><text start="539.6" dur="3.52">like if you do x you will get y coins</text><text start="541.44" dur="3.04">and building a market for that</text><text start="543.12" dur="2.159">but then we realized bounties weren&apos;t</text><text start="544.48" dur="2.16">all that because they were too</text><text start="545.279" dur="2.801">transactional we tried to launch this</text><text start="546.64" dur="3.04">mft called kudos where it was like a</text><text start="548.08" dur="4.48">hallmark card i could send you a kudos</text><text start="549.68" dur="5.2">and say good job um and then we launched</text><text start="552.56" dur="4.24">bitcoin labs and an ad network and</text><text start="554.88" dur="3.519">kernel and we landed on git coin grants</text><text start="556.8" dur="3.28">as like the final thing</text><text start="558.399" dur="3.521">and then even when we were there

dur="5.039">clock speed that&apos;s every quarter and so</text><text start="583.76" dur="4.56">i i don&apos;t know it&apos;s interesting to think</text><text start="585.839" dur="4.241">about that as an evolutionary organism</text><text start="588.32" dur="3.6">i&apos;m curious any comments on what i just</text><text start="590.08" dur="3.199">prompted with git coin given my object</text><text

dur="3.2">great illustration of of evolutionary</text><text start="604.48" dur="3.359">orgs and what i think is most</text><text start="605.68" dur="3.12">interesting about some of those pieces</text><text start="607.839" dur="3.921">is that</text><text start="608.8" dur="5.279">in any like complex system that you&apos;re</text><text start="611.76" dur="5.519">trying to establish</text><text start="614.079" dur="5.681">some organization within you basically</text><text start="617.279" dur="5.761">have to keep poking it to see what the</text><text start="619.76" dur="5.519">response is so like this is why mvps</text><text start="623.04" dur="4.479">work so well in general is there a</text><text start="625.279" dur="3.761">minimum amount of effort and energy</text><text start="627.519" dur="4.0">you&apos;re putting into something just to</text><text start="629.04" dur="5.359">get feedback from a market and i think</text><text start="631.519" dur="4.641">it&apos;s that constant willingness to evolve</text><text start="634.399" dur="3.041">and test and poke the system and see</text><text start="636.16" dur="2.96">what it does</text><text start="637.44" dur="3.12">that not only allows you to get to the</text><text start="639.12" dur="4.08">point where you&apos;ve worked you&apos;re working</text><text start="640.56" dur="4.24">on something that&apos;s um really beneficial</text><text start="643.2" dur="3.759">for the ecosystem more broadly and you</text><text start="644.8" dur="4.719">get more of that feedback and you get</text><text start="646.959" dur="5.521">better at it um but it also i think</text><text start="649.519" dur="5.361">really allows you to understand where</text><text start="652.48" dur="4.16">you sit within a system that&apos;s changing</text><text start="654.88" dur="2.959">a lot so like when i whenever i think</text><text start="656.64" dur="2.72">about dows one of the things that i</text><text start="657.839" dur="4.641">think they are</text><text start="659.36" dur="4.719">when they&apos;re done well good at is uh</text><text start="662.48" dur="2.88">adapting to their environment which i</text><text start="664.079" dur="2.481">think is really useful when you have an</text><text start="665.36" dur="2.88">environment like crypto where like</text><text start="666.56" dur="3.44">things around us are constantly changing</text><text start="668.24" dur="3.92">regulatory stuff is changing the way</text><text start="670.0" dur="3.519">that the public sees cryptos changing</text><text start="672.16" dur="3.359">and when you have the ability to</text><text start="673.519" dur="4.081">constantly poke at that environment</text><text start="675.519" dur="4.081">around you and say hmm what&apos;s the</text><text start="677.6" dur="4.239">current status of this environment</text><text start="679.6" dur="4.0">what&apos;s working what isn&apos;t um that is</text><text start="681.839" dur="4.641">where you end up with an organization</text><text start="683.6" dur="5.359">that actually can deeply understand its</text><text start="686.48" dur="5.44">environment without needing to have some</text><text start="688.959" dur="4.721">like wild foresight that you know most</text><text start="691.92" dur="2.8">people are never going to have</text><text start="693.68" dur="2.159">i mean at some point i think we&apos;re</text><text start="694.72" dur="2.64">talking about the difference between</text><text start="695.839" dur="2.961">empirical knowledge and a priority</text><text start="697.36" dur="3.599">knowledge a priori knowledge being</text><text start="698.8" dur="3.599">derived from theoretical deduction so</text><text start="700.959" dur="3.841">like the realm of math</text><text start="702.399" dur="3.841">science uh first principles thinking and</text><text start="704.8" dur="3.44">then empirical knowledge which is</text><text start="706.24" dur="4.64">testing a</text><text start="708.24" dur="4.159">your status against the world uh type of</text><text start="710.88" dur="3.28">thing and one of the things that really</text><text start="712.399" dur="4.321">springs up for me is that one of the</text><text start="714.16" dur="4.799">theories that i hold high about the</text><text start="716.72" dur="3.2">information age is that network systems</text><text start="718.959" dur="2.88">uh</text><text start="719.92" dur="3.68">work well in a world that&apos;s complex and</text><text start="721.839" dur="3.201">is evolving quickly because you have</text><text start="723.6" dur="2.64">edges of the network that can test and</text><text start="725.04" dur="2.88">then report back to the rest of the</text><text start="726.24" dur="2.96">network whereas hierarchical systems are</text><text start="727.92" dur="2.8">very good at people putting people on</text><text start="729.2" dur="2.96">the front line and just projecting</text><text start="730.72" dur="3.2">thrust in one direction where it&apos;s</text><text start="732.16" dur="3.359">already known in the state of the world</text><text start="733.92" dur="3.52">so you&apos;re</text><text start="735.519" dur="3.44">deriving out of that dow&apos;s should be</text><text start="737.44" dur="3.04">good at adapting to their environment</text><text start="738.959" dur="4.0">just basically means that they&apos;re a</text><text start="740.48" dur="4.0">network system that&apos;s really good at</text><text start="742.959" dur="2.721">probably both empirical knowledge and a</text><text start="744.48" dur="3.039">priority knowledge depending on the</text><text start="745.68" dur="2.8">clock speed there where does that land</text><text start="747.519" dur="2.961">for you</text><text start="748.48" dur="4.56">yeah i think so this is like a really</text><text start="750.48" dur="5.039">fun distinction because</text><text start="753.04" dur="4.56">i think what you what you actually want</text><text start="755.519" dur="5.041">to do is find the balance between both</text><text start="757.6" dur="5.359">of those things i think oftentimes in</text><text start="760.56" dur="5.76">the discourse around dowse we get really</text><text start="762.959" dur="5.201">caught up in this idea of like a network</text><text start="766.32" dur="3.92">that&apos;s taking this like empirical</text><text start="768.16" dur="4.72">approach where they are getting some</text><text start="770.24" dur="5.76">sort of response and often you lack some</text><text start="772.88" dur="5.44">sort of clear directionality like i</text><text start="776.0" dur="4.88">think that is something that if you</text><text start="778.32" dur="4.8">looked only at crypto twitter how people</text><text start="780.88" dur="3.44">talk about dows you would often see</text><text start="783.12" dur="3.36">dow&apos;s lack</text><text start="784.32" dur="4.0">like strategic directionality basically</text><text start="786.48" dur="3.84">because they&apos;re constantly just reacting</text><text start="788.32" dur="4.079">to their environment or to individuals</text><text start="790.32" dur="3.519">who are emerging in that environment um</text><text start="792.399" dur="3.201">on the flip side you&apos;ll see people say</text><text start="793.839" dur="4.321">well companies have this but they lack x</text><text start="795.6" dur="3.6">y and z and so i think what becomes</text><text start="798.16" dur="3.44">really</text><text start="799.2" dur="4.639">like this this fun thing that you need</text><text start="801.6" dur="3.6">to do in orgs like daos and i&apos;m curious</text><text start="803.839" dur="3.761">if this lands for you from the git coin</text><text start="805.2" dur="4.639">perspective is say</text><text start="807.6" dur="5.2">here&apos;s a container where our goal is</text><text start="809.839" dur="4.56">this from first principles thinking so</text><text start="812.8" dur="4.08">maybe it&apos;s</text><text start="814.399" dur="4.56">um making sure that we&apos;re funding public</text><text start="816.88" dur="3.44">goods for example and we&apos;ll see from</text><text start="818.959" dur="2.88">getting to point a to point b what that</text><text start="820.32" dur="3.68">actually looks like but like this is the</text><text start="821.839" dur="4.0">direction we&apos;re going and then using</text><text start="824.0" dur="4.079">more of the empirical approach to figure</text><text start="825.839" dur="4.961">out how do we get there and i think like</text><text start="828.079" dur="4.641">oftentimes dow shy away from defining</text><text start="830.8" dur="3.2">that direction because people think that</text><text start="832.72" dur="2.479">means that you&apos;re doing some sort of</text><text start="834.0" dur="3.44">top-down</text><text start="835.199" dur="5.361">whatever the reality is if you don&apos;t do</text><text start="837.44" dur="4.399">that a network has no way to know where</text><text start="840.56" dur="3.68">it&apos;s supposed to be growing</text><text start="841.839" dur="3.44">directionality yeah exactly</text><text start="844.24" dur="3.039">at times</text><text start="845.279" dur="4.0">has lack generality or sorry</text><text start="847.279" dur="3.36">direction-ness and it&apos;s just grown in</text><text start="849.279" dur="3.521">all different directions</text><text start="850.639" dur="3.44">like an overgrown garden so that</text><text start="852.8" dur="2.64">resonates</text><text start="854.079" dur="3.12">yeah yeah i mean the way i used to</text><text start="855.44" dur="4.0">visualize this is it&apos;s almost like you</text><text start="857.199" dur="5.041">have a treasure map and between you and</text><text start="859.44" dur="4.079">the treasure is the</text><text start="862.24" dur="2.56">there&apos;s a field and then there&apos;s</text><text start="863.519" dur="3.041">mountains and then you have to fort a</text><text start="864.8" dur="4.56">river and also then there&apos;s some bad</text><text start="866.56" dur="5.44">guys you got to fight and then uh you go</text><text start="869.36" dur="4.08">around the windy bend and you go to pick</text><text start="872.0" dur="2.88">up the treasure chest and you realize oh</text><text start="873.44" dur="2.88">wait that was just a phantom treasure</text><text start="874.88" dur="3.12">chest and there&apos;s another map inside and</text><text start="876.32" dur="3.759">you have to go repeat the whole process</text><text start="878.0" dur="4.88">again and so just like thinking about it</text><text start="880.079" dur="5.12">as an expedition almost like a dnd style</text><text start="882.88" dur="4.24">thing is has been how i&apos;ve maintained my</text><text start="885.199" dur="4.0">sanity or lack thereof as it&apos;s been</text><text start="887.12" dur="4.079">multiple iterations of figuring out how</text><text start="889.199" dur="4.241">we&apos;re going forward so i know that that</text><text start="891.199" dur="4.161">visual metaphor is is kind of how i view</text><text start="893.44" dur="3.36">the exploration of a design space that&apos;s</text><text start="895.36" dur="3.279">really not a visual thing it&apos;s like an</text><text start="896.8" dur="3.2">intellectual frontier</text><text start="898.639" dur="2.721">oh yeah and i think you need that</text><text start="900.0" dur="3.519">because if you don&apos;t end up having that</text><text start="901.36" dur="3.2">like one of the one of the elements that</text><text start="903.519" dur="2.56">i think is</text><text start="904.56" dur="3.76">most important when we think about like</text><text start="906.079" dur="4.401">autonomy i don&apos;t like using the</text><text start="908.32" dur="4.4">autonomous part of dao&apos;s as like</text><text start="910.48" dur="4.479">automated i think that makes sense i</text><text start="912.72" dur="4.479">it&apos;s just not something else it does</text><text start="914.959" dur="4.0">it&apos;s not in some now yeah and i think it</text><text start="917.199" dur="4.481">requires a lot of experimentation before</text><text start="918.959" dur="5.12">you automate things but a lot more</text><text start="921.68" dur="4.0">commonly i think is autonomy at the</text><text start="924.079" dur="3.361">contributor level and thinking about how</text><text start="925.68" dur="3.2">can you empower contributors to be more</text><text start="927.44" dur="3.12">autonomous and i think one of the</text><text start="928.88" dur="4.56">biggest ways is knowing what their</text><text start="930.56" dur="4.399">treasure chest is so that they can go</text><text start="933.44" dur="3.44">and fight the bad guys and know which</text><text start="934.959" dur="3.601">ones are good and bad and like without</text><text start="936.88" dur="3.68">any of that directionality it becomes</text><text start="938.56" dur="2.8">actually really really challenging</text><text start="940.56" dur="3.839">for</text><text start="941.36" dur="6.0">um individuals who want to and have the</text><text start="944.399" dur="4.8">skills to move towards some positive</text><text start="947.36" dur="2.88">outcome to actually step up and do</text><text start="949.199" dur="3.601">something and you either create like a</text><text start="950.24" dur="4.24">power vacuum or complete chaos and</text><text start="952.8" dur="3.12">neither of those things are good</text><text start="954.48" dur="3.2">yeah and sometimes you can&apos;t tell the</text><text start="955.92" dur="5.039">difference between the power vacuum and</text><text start="957.68" dur="5.519">the complete chaos and the autonomy</text><text start="960.959" dur="4.56">that&apos;s where things get more confusing</text><text start="963.199" dur="4.401">when i was a manager of engineers in web</text><text start="965.519" dur="4.401">2 we used to always talk about mastery</text><text start="967.6" dur="5.44">autonomy and purpose for each individual</text><text start="969.92" dur="5.2">so basically inventing a</text><text start="973.04" dur="5.039">area of autonomy in which a contributor</text><text start="975.12" dur="4.24">has mastery which is really about agency</text><text start="978.079" dur="3.041">you don&apos;t if you don&apos;t have mastery</text><text start="979.36" dur="3.839">autonomy purpose you don&apos;t have age like</text><text start="981.12" dur="4.24">agency over creating an outcome</text><text start="983.199" dur="4.481">and and so the combination of not just</text><text start="985.36" dur="3.76">autonomy but mastery of a skill set and</text><text start="987.68" dur="3.2">a purpose a direction that you&apos;re going</text><text start="989.12" dur="3.2">on is what we always that was at least</text><text start="990.88" dur="2.639">the buzzword in web too so i don&apos;t know</text><text start="992.32" dur="4.0">if we&apos;re trying to approach the same</text><text start="993.519" dur="4.56">sort of environment in web 3 with dallas</text><text start="996.32" dur="3.84">oh yeah i think so i mean to me that&apos;s</text><text start="998.079" dur="3.44">like the ingredients for people to be</text><text start="1000.16" dur="3.44">able to do</text><text start="1001.519" dur="4.161">work that they that actually ends up</text><text start="1003.6" dur="4.0">having outcomes that are in line with</text><text start="1005.68" dur="4.159">what&apos;s going on in the barter ecosystem</text><text start="1007.6" dur="3.359">something that i always think about is</text><text start="1009.839" dur="4.881">in</text><text start="1010.959" dur="5.921">in networks like tcpip or or i suppose</text><text start="1014.72" dur="4.72">you protocols might be a better term but</text><text start="1016.88" dur="3.84">um tcp or even blockchains like bitcoin</text><text start="1019.44" dur="2.959">and ethereum</text><text start="1020.72" dur="2.92">you have like a</text><text start="1022.399" dur="3.44">you&apos;re able to have this</text><text start="1023.64" dur="4.919">decentralization partially because</text><text start="1025.839" dur="5.441">there&apos;s a very clear set of things that</text><text start="1028.559" dur="4.081">nodes in these networks of protocols can</text><text start="1031.28" dur="2.88">do like</text><text start="1032.64" dur="3.52">they&apos;re not</text><text start="1034.16" dur="3.679">there&apos;s not a bitcoin node that&apos;s</text><text start="1036.16" dur="3.6">creating a marketing campaign you know</text><text start="1037.839" dur="3.041">like it&apos;s got a very clear set of things</text><text start="1039.76" dur="2.64">that it&apos;s doing</text><text start="1040.88" dur="4.559">and there&apos;s a very clear sense of right</text><text start="1042.4" dur="4.639">or wrong in that because of cryptography</text><text start="1045.439" dur="4.001">and so i think what&apos;s interesting about</text><text start="1047.039" dur="4.561">this idea of like purpose what were the</text><text start="1049.44" dur="3.04">other two purpose mastery autonomy and</text><text start="1051.6" dur="2.88">purpose</text><text start="1052.48" dur="5.12">mastery autonomy and purpose is those</text><text start="1054.48" dur="5.36">are almost like your sets of very clear</text><text start="1057.6" dur="4.56">um things that you as a node in this</text><text start="1059.84" dur="4.959">network can do and if you know the</text><text start="1062.16" dur="4.56">answer to those or you have an idea of</text><text start="1064.799" dur="3.681">what those things actually are i think</text><text start="1066.72" dur="3.36">it becomes a lot easier to act as an</text><text start="1068.48" dur="3.76">independent node in the context of this</text><text start="1070.08" dur="4.8">greater network and without that clarity</text><text start="1072.24" dur="5.439">i think you end up with a very</text><text start="1074.88" dur="3.84">um a very dysfunctional network that</text><text start="1077.679" dur="2.88">actually ends up having all these</text><text start="1078.72" dur="3.28">centralization points which aren&apos;t bad i</text><text start="1080.559" dur="4.881">think like you can have centralization</text><text start="1082.0" dur="5.6">points in taos um but i do think a lot</text><text start="1085.44" dur="3.84">of centralization points actually often</text><text start="1087.6" dur="4.24">is a reflection of</text><text start="1089.28" dur="4.88">ineffective ways of making it clear what</text><text start="1091.84" dur="3.92">individuals can and should be doing</text><text start="1094.16" dur="2.96">right well you know what&apos;s interesting</text><text start="1095.76" dur="3.12">to me about your example about the</text><text start="1097.12" dur="3.919">bitcoin nodes and how none of them can</text><text start="1098.88" dur="3.679">run a marketing campaign is that</text><text

dur="3.68">conversation but thanks for the do you</text><text start="1138.96" dur="5.2">think yeah it probably is um i do think</text><text start="1141.2" dur="5.28">this this idea of emergence is</text><text start="1144.16" dur="4.399">one that i am constantly trying to wrap</text><text start="1146.48" dur="4.48">my head around aaron dignan who wrote a</text><text start="1148.559" dur="5.36">book called brave new work um which is</text><text start="1150.96" dur="5.12">fantastic yeah i love the ready um it</text><text start="1153.919" dur="4.961">talks a lot about emergence and</text><text start="1156.08" dur="4.959">how like emergence can only come from</text><text start="1158.88" dur="4.32">very clear systems and of course like</text><text start="1161.039" dur="4.88">the perfect example of this is something</text><text start="1163.2" dur="5.68">like prices in markets where in free</text><text start="1165.919" dur="5.681">markets it&apos;s actually a lot of people</text><text start="1168.88" dur="5.039">making decisions at a localized level</text><text start="1171.6" dur="4.4">that creates the emergence of like a</text><text start="1173.919" dur="4.961">price of you know a gallon of milk for</text><text start="1176.0" dur="4.559">something like that um and so i do think</text><text start="1178.88" dur="4.4">there&apos;s like a really interesting</text><text start="1180.559" dur="4.24">dynamic at play between</text><text start="1183.28" dur="3.759">intentionality</text><text start="1184.799" dur="5.921">at the local level and</text><text start="1187.039" dur="5.681">emergent outcomes at the sort of</text><text start="1190.72" dur="3.6">i&apos;ll call it national level only because</text><text start="1192.72" dur="4.56">there&apos;s not a better term for it but</text><text start="1194.32" dur="4.719">let&apos;s say like dow wide level um i&apos;m</text><text start="1197.28" dur="5.44">still trying to figure out</text><text start="1199.039" dur="5.201">how easy or possible it is to design for</text><text start="1202.72" dur="4.319">emergence</text><text start="1204.24" dur="4.72">um at the national

dur="4.319">interesting challenge and that gets to</text><text start="1212.96" dur="3.04">the whole gall&apos;s law point again which</text><text start="1214.799" dur="2.961">is just like</text><text start="1216.0" dur="3.84">you know you might know that you want</text><text start="1217.76" dur="3.44">the outcome that is emergent</text><text start="1219.84" dur="3.52">figuring out</text><text start="1221.2" dur="4.4">what the actual local decisions that</text><text start="1223.36" dur="4.96">need to be made to get there are is like</text><text start="1225.6" dur="4.8">pretty challenging like that&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1228.32" dur="3.839">computation and prediction that i think</text><text start="1230.4" dur="3.36">is very hard to do</text><text start="1232.159" dur="3.361">yeah</text><text start="1233.76" dur="3.279">yeah um i think that you know what i</text><text start="1235.52" dur="3.12">love about what you said about emergence</text><text start="1237.039" dur="3.12">at the national level and intentional</text><text start="1238.64" dur="3.76">outcomes at the local level is that</text><text start="1240.159" dur="3.841">you&apos;re describing a bottoms-up system it</text><text start="1242.4" dur="3.12">creates immersion outcomes at the top</text><text start="1244.0" dur="3.28">from the actions of the actors at the</text><text start="1245.52" dur="3.279">bottom which is kind of part of the</text><text start="1247.28" dur="3.6">whole reason that we&apos;re here is to</text><text start="1248.799" dur="4.0">create bottoms up local coordination</text><text start="1250.88" dur="4.56">around our shared needs</text><text start="1252.799" dur="4.721">100 yeah and i think like this is where</text><text start="1255.44" dur="3.84">you get into um</text><text start="1257.52" dur="4.32">what i think are some pretty interesting</text><text start="1259.28" dur="4.48">dynamics happening in the ecosystem of</text><text start="1261.84" dur="3.839">governance more broadly right now which</text><text start="1263.76" dur="6.0">is just how do we think about things</text><text start="1265.679" dur="5.36">like context and who has the context and</text><text start="1269.76" dur="3.279">knowledge to make certain types of</text><text start="1271.039" dur="4.801">decisions and how do we think about that</text><text start="1273.039" dur="5.52">more broadly in where i think daos are</text><text start="1275.84" dur="4.88">going which is basically like i see daos</text><text start="1278.559" dur="5.041">is the vehicle for a more democratic</text><text start="1280.72" dur="5.12">internet and i think what that ends up</text><text start="1283.6" dur="5.28">getting to is if we&apos;re living our lives</text><text start="1285.84" dur="4.56">on these platforms um rather than like</text><text start="1288.88" dur="3.36">in physical spaces we&apos;re spending way</text><text start="1290.4" dur="4.0">more time online then what does it</text><text start="1292.24" dur="4.88">actually look like to engage in these</text><text start="1294.4" dur="4.639">types of systems for like your average</text><text start="1297.12" dur="4.799">person and i don&apos;t know what the right</text><text start="1299.039" dur="4.081">answer is but i think as we get a much</text><text start="1301.919" dur="2.721">better idea of what it looks like to</text><text start="1303.12" dur="3.679">make these local decisions and have</text><text start="1304.64" dur="3.919">context on them um we&apos;re going to be</text><text start="1306.799" dur="3.521">able to design much better systems that</text><text start="1308.559" dur="3.521">normal people will actually</text><text start="1310.32" dur="3.359">be able to engage with</text><text start="1312.08" dur="3.52">beautiful yeah i think there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1313.679" dur="3.441">themes that we share about having more</text><text

dur="3.281">just a trojan horse into the second half</text><text start="1326.32" dur="3.2">of this episode which i wanted to talk</text><text start="1327.84" dur="4.319">about regen stuff so how do we build a</text><text start="1329.52" dur="3.92">better society with web3 how do we green</text><text start="1332.159" dur="3.681">pill more people into creating</text><text start="1333.44" dur="3.84">regenerative bottoms up systems there&apos;s</text><text start="1335.84" dur="4.8">so many threads we can pull here but i&apos;m</text><text start="1337.28" dur="5.519">curious which ones you want to go down</text><text start="1340.64" dur="3.68">i think there&apos;s a lot um</text><text start="1342.799" dur="2.321">well i think more broadly the question</text><text start="1344.32" dur="3.28">of</text><text start="1345.12" dur="3.439">how we think about um</text><text start="1347.6" dur="3.52">a</text><text start="1348.559" dur="4.881">a society that has net positive outcomes</text><text start="1351.12" dur="4.72">that we all engage in is like a big</text><text start="1353.44" dur="4.56">question in my mind taking a step back</text><text start="1355.84" dur="5.68">in general i think it&apos;s important to be</text><text start="1358.0" dur="5.2">like rooted and grounded in this idea of</text><text start="1361.52" dur="3.44">the goal is not for everyone to get rich</text><text start="1363.2" dur="3.28">and the goal&apos;s not for all of these</text><text start="1364.96" dur="2.88">different things that i think</text><text start="1366.48" dur="3.6">if you looked at crypto twitter</text><text start="1367.84" dur="4.64">sometimes feel like um</text><text start="1370.08" dur="4.959">it&apos;s actually to build a society that</text><text start="1372.48" dur="5.6">feels better to exist in and to inhabit</text><text start="1375.039" dur="5.52">and ideally you know also avoid some</text><text start="1378.08" dur="4.32">like doomsday scenario that feels like</text><text start="1380.559" dur="2.801">it might be our future if we&apos;re not</text><text start="1382.4" dur="3.44">careful</text><text start="1383.36" dur="4.72">um and so i think that that in general</text><text start="1385.84" dur="3.92">is is where i come from from a grounded</text><text start="1388.08" dur="3.28">perspective and then i think what</text><text start="1389.76" dur="3.919">becomes fun about that is really</text><text start="1391.36" dur="4.24">thinking about how do we design systems</text><text start="1393.679" dur="4.0">that enable that and enable people to</text><text start="1395.6" dur="5.52">have a say in</text><text start="1397.679" dur="5.921">in how that actually comes to be</text><text start="1401.12" dur="4.72">totally yeah i mean one thing i want to</text><text start="1403.6" dur="4.559">zero on in that you said is that the</text><text start="1405.84" dur="4.24">goal is not to get rich it&apos;s to build a</text><text start="1408.159" dur="4.241">society that feels better to exist in</text><text start="1410.08" dur="4.719">and that sort of reminds me of this this</text><text start="1412.4" dur="4.56">this meme that that david hoffman and</text><text start="1414.799" dur="3.921">i&apos;ve been playing with ethereum is not</text><text start="1416.96" dur="4.079">here to make you rich ethereum is here</text><text start="1418.72" dur="4.24">to make you free and i&apos;m wondering you</text><text start="1421.039" dur="3.52">know there&apos;s a little bit of a chicken</text><text start="1422.96" dur="3.92">under the egg thing here maybe but it</text><text start="1424.559" dur="5.521">feels like the financial incentives if</text><text start="1426.88" dur="6.159">they&apos;re designed in a pro-social way are</text><text start="1430.08" dur="5.599">just a shelling point to create the</text><text start="1433.039" dur="4.161">society that feels better to exist in</text><text start="1435.679" dur="2.88">and i&apos;m wondering how you think about</text><text start="1437.2" dur="3.04">the relationship between those two</text><text start="1438.559" dur="3.441">things is one the chicken and the other</text><text start="1440.24" dur="4.16">the egg or is is it more directional</text><text start="1442.0" dur="2.4">than that</text><text start="1444.88" dur="4.24">it&apos;s interesting because when i think</text><text start="1446.32" dur="4.479">about like the the people who</text><text start="1449.12" dur="3.36">i&apos;m friends with</text><text start="1450.799" dur="5.36">like just people who are digitally</text><text start="1452.48" dur="4.88">native don&apos;t really care about crypto um</text><text start="1456.159" dur="2.321">i think</text><text start="1457.36" dur="4.48">this is probably</text><text start="1458.48" dur="5.12">wrong but i&apos;ll say it out loud to share</text><text start="1461.84" dur="3.199">my train of thought well maybe we can</text><text start="1463.6" dur="4.0">evolve past it</text><text start="1465.039" dur="5.201">yes we can start simple and evolve part</text><text start="1467.6" dur="4.959">of me thinks that</text><text start="1470.24" dur="4.319">we&apos;ve attracted the people who are</text><text start="1472.559" dur="3.441">interested in financial gain at this</text><text start="1474.559" dur="3.681">point like</text><text start="1476.0" dur="3.679">i don&apos;t actually think that&apos;s true but i</text><text start="1478.24" dur="4.48">think when i</text><text start="1479.679" dur="5.201">anecdotally talk with friends of mine</text><text start="1482.72" dur="4.559">the idea of like</text><text start="1484.88" dur="5.2">getting rich or even the idea of</text><text start="1487.279" dur="4.64">building a new financial system</text><text start="1490.08" dur="4.32">is no longer</text><text start="1491.919" dur="5.201">interesting to them like that&apos;s not what</text><text start="1494.4" dur="6.56">gets them excited i think what gets them</text><text start="1497.12" dur="6.48">excited is the idea of digital co-ops</text><text start="1500.96" dur="5.92">which is how i describe dows or</text><text start="1503.6" dur="5.76">creating opportunity for artists who</text><text start="1506.88" dur="4.56">typically have not had access to these</text><text start="1509.36" dur="5.36">like crazy art markets for a variety of</text><text start="1511.44" dur="4.32">reasons and so i kind of think</text><text start="1514.72" dur="3.52">the</text><text start="1515.76" dur="4.72">the whole idea of like financial upside</text><text start="1518.24" dur="4.559">as the shelling point is</text><text start="1520.48" dur="4.079">definitely true for some people but i</text><text start="1522.799" dur="2.88">actually think that</text><text start="1524.559" dur="2.961">the shelling point is going to be</text><text start="1525.679" dur="3.841">different for different groups of people</text><text start="1527.52" dur="4.159">and that&apos;s also going to evolve over</text><text start="1529.52" dur="5.12">time which is really exciting to me like</text><text start="1531.679" dur="5.041">i think that is that that speaks to</text><text start="1534.64" dur="4.24">the use cases you know everyone&apos;s doing</text><text start="1536.72" dur="4.64">those dumb use case threats but truly</text><text start="1538.88" dur="4.08">the the fact that we&apos;ve begun to do</text><text start="1541.36" dur="3.199">things like what git coin is doing where</text><text start="1542.96" dur="4.56">we&apos;re actually funding public goods and</text><text start="1544.559" dur="4.321">like all of these real examples of ways</text><text start="1547.52" dur="3.519">in which web 3 is making the world</text><text start="1548.88" dur="3.919">better and that&apos;s actually what i think</text><text start="1551.039" dur="3.921">is going to be a bigger shelling point</text><text start="1552.799" dur="5.521">for a lot of people who have not already</text><text start="1554.96" dur="4.8">been onboarded into web3</text><text start="1558.32" dur="2.88">you know it&apos;s interesting as you&apos;re</text><text start="1559.76" dur="3.36">saying that it&apos;s different to different</text><text start="1561.2" dur="4.079">people and i feel like in a way that&apos;s</text><text start="1563.12" dur="3.28">one of the paradoxes of a global ledger</text><text start="1565.279" dur="2.88">is that</text><text start="1566.4" dur="3.6">we can now we now have this open source</text><text start="1568.159" dur="3.281">global ledger that anyone can program</text><text start="1570.0" dur="2.4">and if you can program your values into</text><text start="1571.44" dur="3.119">your money then there&apos;s going to be</text><text start="1572.4" dur="4.159">these local pockets of emergent bottoms</text><text start="1574.559" dur="4.081">up values that come up and there&apos;s going</text><text start="1576.559" dur="3.36">to be people who care about it for</text><text start="1578.64" dur="3.519">the getting rich part and there&apos;s going</text><text start="1579.919" dur="4.161">to be people who care about the getting</text><text start="1582.159" dur="2.721">the creating more freedom part and then</text><text start="1584.08" dur="2.88">there&apos;s going to be people who are</text><text start="1584.88" dur="4.56">fighting it because they just</text><text start="1586.96" dur="5.12">are benefited by the old system</text><text start="1589.44" dur="3.92">and it&apos;s really it and when i when i</text><text start="1592.08" dur="2.8">articulate it in that way or at least</text><text start="1593.36" dur="3.12">try to articulate it it feels like it&apos;s</text><text start="1594.88" dur="3.279">almost a mirror that we&apos;re holding up as</text><text start="1596.48" dur="3.92">like a lens into looking back at</text><text start="1598.159" dur="3.76">ourselves as humanity and what are the</text><text start="1600.4" dur="4.08">values that we want to program into our</text><text start="1601.919" dur="4.64">money systems from here</text><text start="1604.48" dur="4.319">yeah and it&apos;s so i think where this gets</text><text start="1606.559" dur="4.641">really interesting is um</text><text start="1608.799" dur="4.24">also john hillis is someone who clearly</text><text start="1611.2" dur="3.12">has been influencing my thinking lately</text><text start="1613.039" dur="2.64">because i keep referencing him but he&apos;s</text><text start="1614.32" dur="3.2">got so many good thoughts on this from</text><text start="1615.679" dur="3.841">cabin um i was talking to him a while</text><text start="1617.52" dur="4.639">ago about this idea of like the</text><text start="1619.52" dur="4.639">blockchain as the leviathan sort of</text><text start="1622.159" dur="4.561">where you know you used to have the</text><text start="1624.159" dur="5.041">state that was sort of like um which was</text><text start="1626.72" dur="4.0">often monarchy that is like this</text><text start="1629.2" dur="2.4">enforcing</text><text start="1630.72" dur="3.439">um</text><text start="1631.6" dur="4.559">power that said you have to act</text><text start="1634.159" dur="3.281">in accordance with these laws otherwise</text><text start="1636.159" dur="2.801">we&apos;ll punish you</text><text start="1637.44" dur="4.32">and i think what&apos;s become really</text><text start="1638.96" dur="5.28">interesting about blockchain is that</text><text start="1641.76" dur="4.639">actually you are able to locally encode</text><text start="1644.24" dur="4.159">values and</text><text start="1646.399" dur="5.441">design patterns that you want to live by</text><text start="1648.399" dur="5.28">into these like specific um currencies</text><text start="1651.84" dur="4.4">in some cases but in other cases like</text><text start="1653.679" dur="4.401">communities and governance systems and</text><text start="1656.24"

dur="4.88">now</text><text start="1696.72" dur="5.04">yeah i mean i think that</text><text start="1699.52" dur="4.08">it</text><text start="1701.76" dur="3.36">okay so to put it in the evolutionary</text><text start="1703.6" dur="2.959">perspective the simple system that i</text><text start="1705.12" dur="5.279">would describe back to you that you just</text><text start="1706.559" dur="5.36">said is that there&apos;s a bunch of</text><text start="1710.399" dur="2.561">we now have this new medium which is the</text><text start="1711.919" dur="2.401">internet of money in which

start="1744.159" dur="3.76">yeah and i think the the big question</text><text start="1746.72" dur="2.319">there</text><text start="1747.919" dur="2.921">if i like</text><text start="1749.039"

start="1755.279" dur="5.601">a grain of salt but i do think we&apos;ve</text><text start="1757.44" dur="6.0">seen like populism and the last 10 years</text><text start="1760.88" dur="3.96">of the

which</text><text start="1795.36" dur="5.039">we&apos;re optimizing for humans thriving</text><text start="1798.24" dur="4.319">ideally from what comes from that</text><text start="1800.399" dur="4.561">instead of something that can be a lot</text><text start="1802.559" dur="5.761">darker obviously we can&apos;t always avoid</text><text start="1804.96" dur="5.439">the darker stuff but to me when you play</text><text start="1808.32" dur="4.8">that back my mind is like</text><text start="1810.399" dur="4.081">okay yep that&apos;s true also we now need to</text><text start="1813.12" dur="3.76">make sure that we&apos;re setting up the</text><text start="1814.48" dur="4.24">right environment such that again when</text><text start="1816.88" dur="3.679">you&apos;re when we&apos;re evolving from a more</text><text start="1818.72" dur="4.16">simple to complex system the environment</text><text start="1820.559" dur="4.801">in which it exists in that is like</text><text start="1822.88" dur="4.96">creating this container is enforcing</text><text start="1825.36" dur="4.4">positive values instead of letting it go</text><text start="1827.84" dur="4.24">down a really dark path</text><text start="1829.76" dur="3.76">cool so i just googled the word thriving</text><text start="1832.08" dur="3.599">which apparently means to grow or</text><text start="1833.52" dur="5.2">develop well or vigorously and to</text><text start="1835.679" dur="5.281">prosper and to flourish so designing we</text><text start="1838.72" dur="4.319">have a container and what is the system</text><text start="1840.96" dur="3.599">you can set up that</text><text start="1843.039" dur="3.841">event eventually will create the</text><text start="1844.559" dur="4.401">conditions such

start="1851.36" dur="3.36">design space as i would state it back to</text><text start="1852.96" dur="4.079">you</text><text start="1854.72" dur="4.319">yeah exactly and i think things like</text><text start="1857.039" dur="4.88">public goods as a meme and funding</text><text start="1859.039" dur="5.601">public goods the green pill meme the the</text><text start="1861.919" dur="5.36">regen meme like those are all trying to</text><text start="1864.64" dur="4.8">define a container that ideally makes</text><text start="1867.279" dur="4.4">the median of whatever</text><text start="1869.44" dur="5.28">develops something that&apos;s a lot more</text><text start="1871.679" dur="5.6">positive as opposed to something that is</text><text start="1874.72" dur="2.559">pretty dark</text><text start="1877.44" dur="3.599">you know another design criteria that</text><text start="1879.36" dur="3.36">comes to mind for me is vitalik always</text><text start="1881.039" dur="4.721">talks in proof of stake</text><text start="1882.72" dur="5.36">about creating a system that is uh</text><text start="1885.76" dur="4.399">economically cheaper to defend than it</text><text start="1888.08" dur="4.24">is to attack so the idea with proof of</text><text start="1890.159" dur="3.281">stake that you have to deposit 32 eth</text><text start="1892.32" dur="3.839">and then</text><text start="1893.44" dur="4.239">you defend that each by validating</text><text start="1896.159" dur="3.36">blocks on it and then you know if you</text><text start="1897.679" dur="3.681">lie to the network then you get slashed</text><text start="1899.519" dur="3.601">and you lose that and so it&apos;s much</text><text start="1901.36" dur="2.48">cheaper to defend that system than it is</text><text start="1903.12" dur="1.919">to</text><text start="1903.84" dur="2.88">uh</text><text start="1905.039" dur="3.52">attack that system and that&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="1906.72" dur="3.36">going to create the anti-fragility of it</text><text start="1908.559" dur="4.24">in an adversarial environment which is</text><text start="1910.08" dur="4.719">the world and so the question for me is</text><text start="1912.799" dur="3.521">how do you create a</text><text start="1914.799" dur="3.681">i i mean i think like how do you create</text><text start="1916.32" dur="5.04">a pro-social positive reinforcement loop</text><text start="1918.48" dur="5.84">that&apos;s regenerative that is simpler</text><text start="1921.36" dur="5.36">to and cheaper to defend than it is to</text><text start="1924.32" dur="6.239">attack and and one of the things that</text><text start="1926.72" dur="5.76">you know i i i i&apos;m i&apos;m not sure i i i</text><text start="1930.559" dur="3.761">just said like not sure about about how</text><text start="1932.48" dur="3.36">to do that especially in a world where</text><text start="1934.32" dur="3.12">misinformation</text><text start="1935.84" dur="4.079">and um</text><text start="1937.44" dur="5.04">basically like tribalism can basically</text><text start="1939.919" dur="4.801">attack any any pro-social cause and and</text><text start="1942.48" dur="4.48">tear it down uh it just feels like it&apos;s</text><text start="1944.72" dur="4.16">easier to attack and like deconstruct</text><text start="1946.96" dur="3.439">institutions right now than it is to</text><text start="1948.88" dur="3.12">create institutions and that&apos;s what i</text><text start="1950.399" dur="4.241">worry about within the prism of</text><text start="1952.0" dur="4.88">vitalik&apos;s design criteria so i don&apos;t</text><text start="1954.64" dur="3.759">know if you have anything to add to that</text><text start="1956.88" dur="3.36">yeah it&apos;s pretty interesting because i</text><text start="1958.399" dur="4.081">think when i think about what makes it</text><text start="1960.24" dur="5.84">easier to defend than attack i actually</text><text start="1962.48" dur="5.919">like am drawn back to the root of why we</text><text start="1966.08" dur="4.959">do anything which is again</text><text start="1968.399" dur="4.16">to just make life as a human better and</text><text start="1971.039" dur="2.64">like less</text><text start="1972.559" dur="4.561">bad</text><text start="1973.679" dur="5.761">to put it bluntly um and so i think</text><text start="1977.12" dur="5.279">where where my brain goes around a lot</text><text start="1979.44" dur="4.8">of that stuff is how can we shape an</text><text start="1982.399" dur="5.52">environment where</text><text start="1984.24" dur="6.96">the human experience is something that</text><text start="1987.919" dur="5.201">we&apos;re like very openly and intentionally</text><text start="1991.2" dur="5.359">designing for because it is in the</text><text start="1993.12" dur="5.76">benefit of everyone to defend their own</text><text start="1996.559" dur="4.161">mental health and well-being um and</text><text start="1998.88" dur="3.6">physical well-being too</text><text start="2000.72" dur="3.28">and so i don&apos;t know what the what the</text><text start="2002.48" dur="2.799">answer is going to be to that obviously</text><text start="2004.0" dur="4.88">i don&apos;t think anyone has a good answer</text><text start="2005.279" dur="5.921">but i do think that we ideally if we</text><text start="2008.88" dur="4.96">can build the right norms and</text><text start="2011.2" dur="4.959">much easier said than done but do have</text><text start="2013.84" dur="4.48">this like deep incentive to make it</text><text start="2016.159" dur="4.24">easier to defend than attack because we</text><text start="2018.32" dur="4.8">are effectively defending our own</text><text start="2020.399" dur="6.081">welfare or future welfare</text><text start="2023.12" dur="4.559">yeah i i think that that&apos;s beautiful um</text><text start="2026.48" dur="4.0">so shaping an environment where the</text><text start="2027.679" dur="4.961">human experience is is designed for</text><text start="2030.48" dur="3.919">thriving um</text><text start="2032.64" dur="4.0">and i wonder about the the difference</text><text start="2034.399" dur="4.4">between positive some games and rival</text><text start="2036.64" dur="4.32">risk games there when you look at like</text><text start="2038.799" dur="4.321">you know with um dunbar&apos;s number it&apos;s</text><text start="2040.96" dur="4.64">like you can only have five intimate</text><text start="2043.12" dur="4.159">friends 15 casual friends 50 people in</text><text start="2045.6" dur="3.92">your tribe and 150 that you can have</text><text start="2047.279" dur="3.521">stable social relationships with that&apos;s</text><text start="2049.52" dur="3.52">where you&apos;re having positive some</text><text start="2050.8" dur="4.879">experiences with people but like my</text><text start="2053.04" dur="4.799">relationship to mark zuckerberg is that</text><text start="2055.679" dur="5.361">he gets 45 minutes of my mind space</text><text start="2057.839" dur="5.52">every morning while i&apos;m like you know uh</text><text start="2061.04" dur="3.44">getting ready for work and then he gets</text><text start="2063.359" dur="2.081">eight dollars worth of advertising</text><text start="2064.48" dur="3.52">revenue on it and then there&apos;s a</text><text start="2065.44" dur="4.479">negative externality to my mental health</text><text start="2068.0" dur="4.159">from that so like across the localism of</text><text start="2069.919" dur="3.841">humanity how do we defend</text><text start="2072.159" dur="3.92">or how do we build stronger</text><text start="2073.76" dur="4.639">fortification of our relationships where</text><text start="2076.079" dur="3.681">we hold each other closely and prevent</text><text start="2078.399" dur="3.28">extraction from other people that are</text><text start="2079.76" dur="4.079">going to externalize harm to us is kind</text><text start="2081.679" dur="3.601">of how i visualize that in my head but</text><text start="2083.839" dur="4.721">uh you know i don&apos;t know if the</text><text start="2085.28" dur="5.92">rivalrousness of that global competition</text><text start="2088.56" dur="4.4">for resources uh in the externalities</text><text start="2091.2" dur="3.36">that can come from that if that if that</text><text start="2092.96" dur="4.159">brings up anything for you</text><text start="2094.56" dur="5.68">yeah i i would actually be interested to</text><text start="2097.119" dur="5.841">try to understand if larger systems end</text><text start="2100.24" dur="5.2">up relying more on rivalrous</text><text start="2102.96" dur="4.879">um competition as opposed to positive</text><text start="2105.44" dur="4.48">some type games</text><text start="2107.839" dur="5.201">my guess would be potentially because</text><text start="2109.92" dur="5.439">ultimately like some of public goods</text><text start="2113.04" dur="4.48">i would imagine as you scale something</text><text start="2115.359" dur="4.401">um tragedy of the commons tends to</text><text start="2117.52" dur="4.8">happen more often whereas like when you</text><text start="2119.76" dur="4.319">have reputation systems it&apos;s probably</text><text start="2122.32" dur="3.039">less common that would be like my gut</text><text start="2124.079" dur="3.52">intuition</text><text start="2125.359" dur="5.041">which kind of makes me think that</text><text start="2127.599" dur="5.52">it is in fact these smaller groups that</text><text start="2130.4" dur="4.88">allow us to act more like our brains</text><text start="2133.119" dur="4.801">we&apos;re in sort of intended to act as we</text><text start="2135.28" dur="4.24">developed which is in like tribes of</text><text start="2137.92" dur="3.6">people whereby</text><text start="2139.52" dur="3.76">your malicious behavior</text><text start="2141.52" dur="3.12">is something that is like much less</text><text start="2143.28" dur="3.04">appealing to you as an individual</text><text start="2144.64" dur="3.92">because you&apos;re going to be held</text><text start="2146.32" dur="4.0">accountable for it if there&apos;s only five</text><text start="2148.56" dur="3.519">people who are also acknowledging your</text><text start="2150.32" dur="4.24">malicious behavior</text><text start="2152.079" dur="4.321">um all that is to say like one of my</text><text start="2154.56" dur="5.039">biggest hopes for web 3 is actually that</text><text start="2156.4" dur="5.52">it makes the internet a lot more local</text><text start="2159.599" dur="4.081">such that we don&apos;t have</text><text start="2161.92" dur="5.199">the ability to play</text><text start="2163.68" dur="5.12">this like huge global game of how can i</text><text start="2167.119" dur="3.441">extract the most value from the most</text><text start="2168.8" dur="4.16">amount of people which is very</text><text start="2170.56" dur="5.039">normalized by the way by like you know</text><text start="2172.96" dur="4.159">venture capital sized returns like all</text><text start="2175.599" dur="3.681">of those things have become normalized</text><text start="2177.119" dur="4.561">with the institutions that we&apos;ve built</text><text start="2179.28" dur="4.24">um and so i think the hope would</text><text start="2181.68" dur="4.48">actually be your point about dunbar&apos;s</text><text start="2183.52" dur="4.0">number and all of these pieces that and</text><text start="2186.16" dur="3.199">this is kind of where like what we&apos;re</text><text start="2187.52" dur="4.319">doing with pods comes in but i also</text><text start="2189.359" dur="4.401">think in general like ideally dows start</text><text start="2191.839" dur="4.0">to bring some of this about and things</text><text start="2193.76" dur="3.52">like lens and what they&apos;re doing with</text><text start="2195.839" dur="3.841">allowing anyone to build different</text><text start="2197.28" dur="3.839">clients and stuff like that um hopefully</text><text start="2199.68" dur="3.28">what that ends up creating is actually</text><text start="2201.119" dur="2.801">like an incentive for people to build</text><text start="2202.96" dur="3.92">local</text><text start="2203.92" dur="7.199">groups as opposed to like massively</text><text start="2206.88" dur="6.959">scaled um systems that honestly aren&apos;t</text><text start="2211.119" dur="4.24">really how people were intended to be in</text><text start="2213.839" dur="3.441">relation to one another in the first</text><text start="2215.359" dur="3.441">place</text><text start="2217.28" dur="2.799">yeah that&apos;s such an interesting insight</text><text start="2218.8" dur="2.96">and i&apos;m actually</text><text start="2220.079" dur="3.28">season two of the green pill podcast is</text><text start="2221.76" dur="4.24">all gonna be about reputation and</text><text start="2223.359" dur="5.041">identity systems uh so i&apos;m glad that we</text><text start="2226.0" dur="5.119">that we came back to it basically</text><text start="2228.4" dur="5.439">uh the reputation system in local groups</text><text start="2231.119" dur="4.801">in smaller groups um is sort of maybe</text><text start="2233.839" dur="4.081">what creates those positive some games</text><text start="2235.92" dur="5.199">and it reminds me of this this evolution</text><text start="2237.92" dur="5.199">of trust game that that nikki case built</text><text start="2241.119" dur="3.441">a little while ago where you basically</text><text start="2243.119" dur="3.361">can like speed run</text><text start="2244.56" dur="4.24">a bunch of system</text><text start="2246.48" dur="5.44">humans in a system as rational economic</text><text start="2248.8" dur="5.12">agents and at the end of it he reveals</text><text start="2251.92" dur="4.48">that as long as the system has repeat</text><text start="2253.92" dur="4.88">interactions possible win wins and low</text><text start="2256.4" dur="4.24">miscommunication that&apos;s the evolution of</text><text start="2258.8" dur="4.08">positive some games that are not</text><text start="2260.64" dur="3.28">rivalrous and the opposite of as</text><text start="2262.88" dur="2.959">negative some games where you&apos;re</text><text start="2263.92" dur="3.76">stealing from each other um and it&apos;s</text><text start="2265.839" dur="3.921">just so interesting that you you noted</text><text start="2267.68" dur="4.24">that reputation is sort of the</text><text start="2269.76" dur="4.8">the tissue that takes you to being able</text><text start="2271.92" dur="4.0">to have repeat interactions and uh with</text><text start="2274.56" dur="2.72">people because you can track their</text><text start="2275.92" dur="3.28">behavior and their identity and see</text><text start="2277.28" dur="3.04">whether they&apos;re rivalrous or not and it</text><text start="2279.2" dur="3.44">sort of makes me feel like we&apos;re in this</text><text start="2280.32" dur="4.56">place where web3 is a dark forest and</text><text start="2282.64" dur="3.76">you don&apos;t see your counterparty they</text><text start="2284.88" dur="2.88">could be an adversary but then</text><text start="2286.4" dur="3.6">reputation allows you to hold up the</text><text start="2287.76" dur="4.8">light to them and enables repeat</text><text start="2290.0" dur="3.839">interactions and and those win wins so i</text><text start="2292.56" dur="2.64">i don&apos;t know what are your thoughts on</text><text start="2293.839" dur="4.561">digital identity and reputation</text><text start="2295.2" dur="5.36">verifiable credentials the whole dsoc</text><text start="2298.4" dur="4.88">meme that&apos;s happening right now</text><text start="2300.56" dur="5.6">yeah i think um there are a lot of</text><text start="2303.28" dur="4.4">elements that uh are missing in web3 but</text><text start="2306.16" dur="2.88">i think identity and reputation is</text><text start="2307.68" dur="2.64">probably one of the biggest ones which</text><text start="2309.04" dur="3.68">is why you see so many people trying to</text><text start="2310.32" dur="3.759">build for it um i&apos;m certainly excited</text><text start="2312.72" dur="2.96">about some of the stuff coming out of</text><text start="2314.079" dur="4.081">get coin around like civil resistance</text><text start="2315.68" dur="3.52">and stuff like that i think</text><text start="2318.16" dur="2.88">a couple</text><text start="2319.2" dur="4.72">interesting elements to note about</text><text start="2321.04" dur="4.24">reputation first it&apos;s very contextual</text><text start="2323.92" dur="3.679">which i think is going to create some</text><text start="2325.28" dur="5.28">interesting challenges for any like</text><text start="2327.599" dur="4.961">reputation standard where um my</text><text start="2330.56" dur="3.44">reputation with you is going to be very</text><text start="2332.56" dur="4.16">different from my reputation with my</text><text start="2334.0" dur="3.68">parents and it&apos;s not because i&apos;m you</text><text start="2336.72" dur="3.119">know</text><text start="2337.68" dur="3.6">acting maliciously or anything like that</text><text start="2339.839" dur="2.961">it&apos;s just that</text><text start="2341.28" dur="3.12">the the way that we engage with each</text><text start="2342.8" dur="3.84">other as humans is just incredibly</text><text start="2344.4" dur="4.64">contextual and so i think that&apos;s going</text><text start="2346.64" dur="4.24">to be a really important part of this</text><text start="2349.04" dur="4.16">um i think when we think about the way</text><text start="2350.88" dur="3.68">that reputation changes group dynamics</text><text start="2353.2" dur="3.44">it&apos;s going to have actually a really</text><text start="2354.56" dur="5.279">positive impact</text><text start="2356.64" dur="4.56">um i think of course we also need to be</text><text start="2359.839" dur="2.961">then something that i think more broadly</text><text start="2361.2" dur="3.2">we need to always be considering is like</text><text start="2362.8" dur="3.36">how does accessibility change some of</text><text start="2364.4" dur="4.88">this stuff so people who have the</text><text start="2366.16" dur="5.199">opportunity to um take actions on chain</text><text start="2369.28" dur="3.92">or you know not sell air drops because</text><text start="2371.359" dur="4.0">they have money that they can live off</text><text start="2373.2" dur="4.56">of like i think we need to be thinking</text><text start="2375.359" dur="4.801">intentionally not only about context uh</text><text start="2377.76" dur="4.8">of like relationships but also about the</text><text start="2380.16" dur="4.16">context of where you&apos;re coming from in</text><text start="2382.56" dur="4.32">the the real world and if where you&apos;re</text><text start="2384.32" dur="4.24">coming from is you don&apos;t have a bunch of</text><text start="2386.88" dur="4.16">money and you struggle to pay rent every</text><text start="2388.56" dur="5.12">month some of your actions on chain are</text><text start="2391.04" dur="4.319">going to make more sense based on that</text><text start="2393.68" dur="3.52">sort of environment you&apos;re existing in</text><text start="2395.359" dur="3.921">so um that&apos;s another piece that i think</text><text start="2397.2" dur="3.44">a lot about with reputation is just not</text><text start="2399.28" dur="3.36">only how can we think about context</text><text start="2400.64" dur="3.12">around people but also around</text><text start="2402.64" dur="2.64">understanding that everyone&apos;s coming</text><text start="2403.76" dur="2.96">from a lot of different backgrounds and</text><text start="2405.28" dur="3.76">that&apos;s going to change</text><text start="2406.72" dur="4.8">the moral sort of assignments that we</text><text start="2409.04" dur="4.48">put on things that maybe we shouldn&apos;t</text><text start="2411.52" dur="3.28">put moral assignments on</text><text start="2413.52" dur="4.559">yeah</text><text start="2414.8" dur="5.6">yeah i i i worry a little bit about the</text><text start="2418.079" dur="3.921">the arbitrage between all reputation</text><text start="2420.4" dur="3.6">being contextual</text><text start="2422.0" dur="4.72">um and so you know you have these global</text><text start="2424.0" dur="4.72">programmable ledgers and then you&apos;ve got</text><text start="2426.72" dur="3.44">reputation systems that mirror them and</text><text start="2428.72" dur="3.52">there&apos;s pointers between them which</text><text start="2430.16" dur="3.76">allows you to create positive some games</text><text start="2432.24" dur="3.28">between the participants but then i</text><text start="2433.92" dur="2.96">worry about the privacy implications of</text><text start="2435.52" dur="3.12">that because if you put all of the</text><text start="2436.88" dur="3.28">context in a way that&apos;s avail you know</text><text start="2438.64" dur="3.84">the example of this is uh you go to the</text><text start="2440.16" dur="4.0">liquor store and you give your id to the</text><text start="2442.48" dur="2.96">the clerk and</text><text start="2444.16" dur="2.56">they see that you&apos;re over 21 but they</text><text start="2445.44" dur="3.2">also get your address and there&apos;s been</text><text start="2446.72" dur="3.44">examples of like creepy clerks looking</text><text start="2448.64" dur="2.719">up women on facebook and friending them</text><text start="2450.16" dur="2.64">after they get there like really you</text><text start="2451.359" dur="4.48">should just have just have to prove that</text><text start="2452.8" dur="4.319">you&apos;re 21 or or older right and so</text><text start="2455.839" dur="2.641">the there&apos;s seems like there&apos;s a</text><text start="2457.119" dur="3.281">trade-off between reputation being</text><text start="2458.48" dur="4.639">highly contextual and a zero-knowledge</text><text start="2460.4" dur="4.56">proof that exposes that to a contract</text><text start="2463.119" dur="4.401">with the need for privacy and the need</text><text start="2464.96" dur="4.32">to not you know be just walking bank</text><text start="2467.52" dur="2.72">accounts with a bunch of like contextual</text><text start="2469.28" dur="4.0">information that can be used</text><text start="2470.24" dur="4.8">adversarially on top of that uh so what</text><text start="2473.28" dur="3.12">do you think about the that contextual</text><text start="2475.04" dur="2.64">requirement versus the privacy</text><text start="2476.4" dur="3.76">requirement</text><text start="2477.68" dur="4.8">yeah i think evan from disco has been</text><text start="2480.16" dur="4.0">doing a really good job pushing a lot of</text><text start="2482.48" dur="3.2">the privacy elements and thinking about</text><text start="2484.16" dur="3.679">what consent looks like that was</text><text start="2485.68" dur="4.72">originally how i got into cryptos</text><text start="2487.839" dur="4.24">actually i was doing a lot with like uh</text><text start="2490.4" dur="4.4">data analytics from a marketing</text><text start="2492.079" dur="4.401">perspective which was interesting and i</text><text start="2494.8" dur="3.44">ended up falling down the crypto rabbit</text><text start="2496.48" dur="4.16">hole like way deeper than that so it</text><text start="2498.24" dur="4.48">worked out um but i do think like how we</text><text start="2500.64" dur="5.28">think about privacy is going to need to</text><text start="2502.72" dur="5.84">change a lot i mean in general on chain</text><text start="2505.92" dur="4.159">we reveal i think already a lot about</text><text start="2508.56" dur="3.759">ourselves that we&apos;re going to look back</text><text start="2510.079" dur="4.641">and say hmm that was strange and</text><text start="2512.319" dur="4.8">um i hope that we have better ways to</text><text start="2514.72" dur="3.44">think about linking different addresses</text><text start="2517.119" dur="2.401">and how we think about that with</text><text start="2518.16" dur="4.08">something like civil resistance and</text><text start="2519.52" dur="4.079">identity so um from that perspective i</text><text start="2522.24" dur="2.8">think too like vitalik i think has</text><text start="2523.599" dur="3.281">presented a really good point for</text><text start="2525.04" dur="3.2">soulbound tokens and i think has had</text><text start="2526.88" dur="4.0">like a very</text><text start="2528.24" dur="4.0">good balance in in his conversation with</text><text start="2530.88" dur="2.88">evan on bank list i think they did a</text><text start="2532.24" dur="3.44">good job representing</text><text start="2533.76" dur="2.88">two different viewpoints and examples</text><text start="2535.68" dur="2.8">where</text><text start="2536.64" dur="3.84">maybe something like soulbound tokens</text><text start="2538.48" dur="3.599">which are a little bit i would say less</text><text start="2540.48" dur="4.08">like consent driven</text><text start="2542.079" dur="4.24">um might make sense same thing with</text><text start="2544.56" dur="3.6">something like verifiable credentials</text><text start="2546.319" dur="3.681">where you actually want this like</text><text start="2548.16" dur="3.919">consent layer i think there&apos;s probably</text><text start="2550.0" dur="4.88">going to be examples where you want both</text><text start="2552.079" dur="4.321">um but i also am very grateful for what</text><text start="2554.88" dur="3.199">evan&apos;s doing and pushing a lot of that</text><text start="2556.4" dur="3.04">stuff and thinking deeply about it those</text><text start="2558.079" dur="2.641">are exactly the kinds of debates that i</text><text start="2559.44" dur="3.12">think we need to be having because it</text><text start="2560.72" dur="4.16">almost doesn&apos;t like the fact that we&apos;re</text><text start="2562.56" dur="5.68">having them makes me have a lot of faith</text><text start="2564.88" dur="4.479">that ultimately we will come to a a good</text><text start="2568.24" dur="4.4">very like</text><text start="2569.359" dur="4.881">ideal outcome hopefully um just the fact</text><text start="2572.64" dur="4.08">that those types of conversations are</text><text start="2574.24" dur="3.839">happening period i think is really good</text><text start="2576.72" dur="3.119">would you say it&apos;s the simple starting</text><text start="2578.079" dur="3.441">conditions that we need to create some</text><text start="2579.839" dur="3.681">something bigger it&apos;s the simple</text><text start="2581.52" dur="4.0">starting conditions and we will evolve</text><text start="2583.52" dur="4.319">from there yeah i hope to create that</text><text start="2585.52" dur="4.24">into a meme i just i think that</text><text start="2587.839" dur="4.401">it&apos;s such a</text><text start="2589.76" dur="4.079">uh gall&apos;s law uh how can we mimify that</text><text start="2592.24" dur="3.599">the fact that any complex system can be</text><text start="2593.839" dur="4.081">reduced to simple starting conditions</text><text start="2595.839" dur="3.52">and replication instructions i don&apos;t</text><text start="2597.92" dur="2.96">know how we mean that but open to</text><text start="2599.359" dur="3.281">suggestion</text><text start="2600.88" dur="3.92">i think the the one thing to point out</text><text start="2602.64" dur="4.479">too on that is like people and people</text><text start="2604.8" dur="5.279">had this response to that piece which i</text><text start="2607.119" dur="5.361">think was really a good point</text><text start="2610.079" dur="4.721">it doesn&apos;t mean not learning from old</text><text start="2612.48" dur="3.839">systems and when i say old systems i</text><text start="2614.8" dur="3.36">really mean like systems that have</text><text start="2616.319" dur="3.52">already gone through the process of</text><text start="2618.16" dur="4.0">evolution i think it&apos;s really important</text><text start="2619.839" dur="3.841">to learn and borrow from them and</text><text start="2622.16" dur="3.6">figure out what works and what doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2623.68" dur="4.159">but again i think it&apos;s really hard to</text><text start="2625.76" dur="3.52">test those assumptions unless you start</text><text start="2627.839" dur="2.801">with the most simple ones in your</text><text start="2629.28" dur="3.12">environment to see</text><text start="2630.64" dur="4.64">which of these assumptions from the you</text><text start="2632.4" dur="4.959">know previous system are and are not</text><text start="2635.28" dur="3.52">true for this new system and that&apos;s like</text><text start="2637.359" dur="4.321">constantly the question i ask myself in</text><text start="2638.8" dur="4.64">web 3 is just is this a new paradigm or</text><text start="2641.68" dur="3.6">is this the same paradigm popping up in</text><text start="2643.44" dur="3.44">a different context and i think you need</text><text start="2645.28" dur="3.12">to answer that question and then you</text><text start="2646.88" dur="3.28">know evolve from there</text><text start="2648.4" dur="2.88">one of my sort of one of my theories is</text><text start="2650.16" dur="3.919">that we&apos;re going to see more</text><text start="2651.28" dur="4.88">skeuomorphic stuff over the near term</text><text start="2654.079" dur="3.601">skeuomorphism just basically means</text><text start="2656.16" dur="3.6">it represents the old world but in the</text><text start="2657.68" dur="3.04">new form uh</text><text start="2659.76" dur="2.24">and then we&apos;re going to see more</text><text start="2660.72" dur="2.72">non-skeomorphic stuff which is</text><text start="2662.0" dur="3.44">fundamentally new and emergent of the</text><text start="2663.44" dur="4.399">new medium over time as this thing</text><text start="2665.44" dur="4.399">evolves and right now dals like you said</text><text start="2667.839" dur="3.76">are just kind of digital organizations</text><text start="2669.839" dur="3.121">but when they really become autonomous</text><text start="2671.599" dur="3.76">and they become these networks i think</text><text start="2672.96" dur="4.159">that&apos;s when it gets really interesting</text><text start="2675.359" dur="2.881">yeah and i also think as just a side</text><text start="2677.119" dur="2.72">note like something that was really</text><text start="2678.24" dur="3.359">funny about all this this whole trend</text><text start="2679.839" dur="3.76">for anyone who didn&apos;t see it it was like</text><text start="2681.599" dur="3.361">here are 10 web 3 use cases that was</text><text start="2683.599" dur="3.041">just like threads that were all over</text><text start="2684.96" dur="3.84">crypto twitter i think the interesting</text><text start="2686.64" dur="4.0">thing about that is actually that like i</text><text start="2688.8" dur="3.68">think web 3 is going to be a lot more of</text><text start="2690.64" dur="3.439">a boiling frog situation which</text><text start="2692.48" dur="4.08">apparently isn&apos;t actually true but it&apos;s</text><text start="2694.079" dur="4.881">this idea that if a frog is in a boiling</text><text start="2696.56" dur="4.08">pot of water they won&apos;t jump out until</text><text start="2698.96" dur="3.28">it&apos;s too late to realize that they&apos;re in</text><text start="2700.64" dur="3.52">a boiling pot of water and i think for</text><text start="2702.24" dur="3.28">that exact same reason that&apos;s what it&apos;s</text><text start="2704.16" dur="3.12">going to look like which is just that</text><text start="2705.52" dur="3.599">it&apos;s going to start as skeuomorphic</text><text start="2707.28" dur="4.24">people will say why are dows any better</text><text start="2709.119" dur="5.761">than companies but slowly over time as</text><text start="2711.52" dur="5.52">people start getting paid in you know</text><text start="2714.88" dur="3.6">tokens because they&apos;re dow contributors</text><text start="2717.04" dur="4.24">d5 will become much more interesting so</text><text start="2718.48" dur="5.76">like slowly i think not only do we</text><text start="2721.28" dur="5.68">evolve but we also start once you&apos;ve</text><text start="2724.24" dur="4.56">taken the pill you start to realize that</text><text start="2726.96" dur="3.359">oh wow this other system is actually</text><text start="2728.8" dur="2.799">super useful and that evolves in</text><text start="2730.319" dur="4.081">response to it so i think we&apos;re creating</text><text start="2731.599" dur="4.561">an entire truly ecosystem</text><text start="2734.4" dur="4.959">yeah got it so more people going down</text><text start="2736.16" dur="5.84">native doing business the the new way</text><text start="2739.359" dur="5.521">in that shelling point of people getting</text><text start="2742.0" dur="4.64">coins pun intended uh is gonna help us</text><text start="2744.88" dur="3.68">evolve over that event horizon what do</text><text start="2746.64" dur="4.08">you think&apos;s over the event horizon</text><text start="2748.56" dur="3.519">loaded question of the episode</text><text start="2750.72" dur="3.28">yeah i mean i hope it&apos;s a more</text><text start="2752.079" dur="3.601">democratic internet again i think like</text><text start="2754.0"

dur="3.68">more likely to be better off if you were</text><text start="2791.119" dur="4.72">in a city than if you were living in the</text><text start="2792.96" dur="5.04">rural area you grew up in i think we&apos;ve</text><text start="2795.839" dur="3.52">seen that decline over time in terms of</text><text start="2798.0" dur="2.96">mobility and i think a lot of the reason</text><text

dur="4.4">we&apos;re online all the time and you and i</text><text start="2804.8" dur="4.48">were talking before this like if unless</text><text start="2807.2" dur="5.2">you are really wanting to be

start="2928.079" dur="3.76">jacobs wrote about this um</text><text start="2930.24" dur="3.839">and one of the one of the interesting</text><text start="2931.839" dur="4.321">pieces when she wrote this about when</text><text start="2934.079" dur="4.161">when she was living in new york um and</text><text start="2936.16" dur="3.76">one of the really interesting pieces is</text><text start="2938.24" dur="3.68">i don&apos;t think she had data to back up</text><text start="2939.92" dur="3.28">some of this but since there have been</text><text start="2941.92" dur="3.679">researchers that have studied this and</text><text start="2943.2" dur="5.2">it&apos;s turned out to be true which is that</text><text start="2945.599" dur="4.96">the density of a city is actually like a</text><text start="2948.4" dur="4.24">pretty good predictor of innovation in</text><text start="2950.559" dur="3.921">that space for that exact reason where</text><text start="2952.64" dur="4.16">you just have like the entropy of people</text><text start="2954.48" dur="4.56">running into each other and being like</text><text start="2956.8" dur="3.84">hey you seem cool we should chat and</text><text start="2959.04" dur="4.319">then you have this like really</text><text start="2960.64" dur="5.28">interesting mix of ideas and and all</text><text start="2963.359" dur="4.321">that kind of stuff um and so i think as</text><text start="2965.92" dur="3.52">that happens more and more online to</text><text start="2967.68" dur="3.76">your point about like how this even</text><text start="2969.44" dur="3.44">happened um we&apos;re gonna start to see a</text><text start="2971.44" dur="3.919">lot of the benefits in these like</text><text start="2972.88" dur="4.32">quote-unquote densely populated you know</text><text start="2975.359" dur="4.321">digital areas</text><text start="2977.2" dur="4.08">um and and so people can choose wherever</text><text start="2979.68" dur="3.12">they want to live but ultimately we&apos;ll</text><text start="2981.28" dur="2.799">actually start to see more and more</text><text start="2982.8" dur="3.279">innovation i mean even when you think</text><text start="2984.079" dur="3.921">about like how people typically would</text><text start="2986.079" dur="3.921">meet their co-founders 10 years ago</text><text start="2988.0" dur="3.44">versus now a lot of people i know have</text><text start="2990.0" dur="3.119">met their co-founders through twitter</text><text start="2991.44" dur="4.399">which is a perfect example of that too</text><text start="2993.119" dur="5.601">where that&apos;s that&apos;s tangible</text><text start="2995.839" dur="4.801">um you know monetary benefits of saying</text><text start="2998.72" dur="3.52">hey we met now let&apos;s like start a</text><text start="3000.64" dur="3.919">company and employ people and that i</text><text start="3002.24" dur="4.8">think is pretty wild what i like is that</text><text start="3004.559" dur="4.161">it lets you vibe check uh a little bit</text><text start="3007.04" dur="3.279">like you&apos;re not just looking at a resume</text><text start="3008.72" dur="3.119">you

want to probe</text><text start="3128.48" dur="3.2">on is okay so we&apos;ve got the density of</text><text start="3129.92" dur="3.36">the city equals more innovation so the</text><text start="3131.68" dur="4.399">density of the network state will equal</text><text start="3133.28" dur="4.64">more innovation are there ways that we</text><text start="3136.079" dur="4.641">can more densely interconnect our</text><text start="3137.92" dur="6.08">network state of the ethereum space uh</text><text start="3140.72" dur="4.879">by i don&apos;t know say allowing actors to</text><text

like</text><text start="3149.28" dur="2.559">the example of this i think is like</text><text start="3150.319" dur="4.401">quadratic funding where it&apos;s just like</text><text start="3151.839" dur="4.881">oh i saw chase like working on uh her</text><text start="3154.72" dur="3.28">podcast and i think that it&apos;s great i&apos;m</text><text start="3156.72" dur="3.04">gonna chip her a dollar and she&apos;s gonna</text><text start="3158.0" dur="3.92">get a hundred dollars because of that</text><text start="3159.76" dur="4.319">you create this density of like is it</text><text start="3161.92" dur="3.6">just density of where where we reside or</text><text start="3164.079" dur="4.401">is there ways to add more coordination</text><text start="3165.52" dur="4.4">to wire it for for more innovation from</text><text start="3168.48" dur="3.119">from there and quadratic funding is</text><text start="3169.92" dur="3.12">maybe just one example but there&apos;s</text><text start="3171.599" dur="4.641">probably other coordination protocols</text><text start="3173.04" dur="4.88">that will allow us to to do that also</text><text start="3176.24" dur="3.92">yeah i think there are like two pieces</text><text start="3177.92" dur="4.8">to this so the first before it is even</text><text start="3180.16" dur="4.88">getting into coordination is actually uh</text><text start="3182.72" dur="4.399">diversity of ideas</text><text start="3185.04" dur="3.519">and perspectives is actually i think</text><text start="3187.119" dur="4.48">like an important predictor when we</text><text start="3188.559" dur="6.721">think about innovation in the context of</text><text start="3191.599" dur="5.76">um what you don&apos;t want is in in</text><text start="3195.28" dur="2.88">another jane jacobs example she compared</text><text start="3197.359" dur="3.841">um</text><text start="3198.16" dur="5.12">birmingham and manchester and this is</text><text start="3201.2" dur="3.76">like a perfect example manchester was i</text><text start="3203.28" dur="3.039">think very heavy on like manufacturing</text><text start="3204.96" dur="5.119">and then birmingham had like a lot more</text><text start="3206.319" dur="5.921">diversity of industries basically and um</text><text start="3210.079" dur="3.361">manchester ended up declining a lot</text><text start="3212.24" dur="2.8">because and this is what happened with</text><text start="3213.44" dur="4.08">detroit i&apos;m from michigan like outside</text><text start="3215.04" dur="5.44">of detroit this is the same deal um when</text><text start="3217.52" dur="6.0">you have one industry or a set of people</text><text start="3220.48" dur="5.44">who are really reliant upon one specific</text><text start="3223.52" dur="4.799">um industry or thing or coming from that</text><text start="3225.92" dur="4.96">perspective you tend to get a city where</text><text start="3228.319" dur="5.441">the moment that that is not healthy the</text><text start="3230.88" dur="3.84">entire city is like in trouble and</text><text start="3233.76" dur="1.92">you&apos;re not going to see as much</text><text start="3234.72" dur="2.399">innovation people are going to leave all</text><text start="3235.68" dur="4.72">this stuff so i actually think one of</text><text start="3237.119" dur="5.041">the big predictors of the how how well a</text><text start="3240.4" dur="3.36">city is doing and how well these digital</text><text start="3242.16" dur="4.24">cities are going to be doing is actually</text><text start="3243.76" dur="5.52">how much can we like interconnect from</text><text start="3246.4" dur="5.679">different parts of the ecosystem and</text><text start="3249.28" dur="5.2">share these different ideas um because</text><text start="3252.079" dur="6.48">any time that that we&apos;re really relying</text><text start="3254.48" dur="6.32">upon a specific thing or only using one</text><text start="3258.559" dur="4.321">specific meme as a shelling point like</text><text start="3260.8" dur="3.759">the moment that that meme is no longer</text><text start="3262.88" dur="4.4">exciting to people the entire thing</text><text start="3264.559" dur="4.881">crumbles so i think that&apos;s one piece the</text><text start="3267.28" dur="4.0">second piece i think is playing with a</text><text start="3269.44" dur="4.879">lot of different coordination games</text><text start="3271.28" dur="5.279">probably that can actually start to</text><text start="3274.319" dur="4.0">create a lot of like weak ties between</text><text start="3276.559" dur="4.161">things so a really good example of this</text><text start="3278.319" dur="5.441">actually along the quadratic funding um</text><text start="3280.72"

like a really</text><text start="3287.92" dur="3.84">cool way to say oh and i&apos;ve done this</text><text start="3289.92" dur="3.679">before like i want to see what some of</text><text

want to see you know what are they</text><text start="3298.0" dur="2.96">interested in right now and so i think</text><text start="3299.68" dur="2.48">there are some really interesting</text><text start="3300.96" dur="3.359">mechanisms that we can start to play</text><text start="3302.16" dur="4.8">around with to optimize for creating</text><text start="3304.319" dur="4.881">weak ties among a very diverse you know</text><text start="3306.96" dur="4.96">set of of players</text><text start="3309.2" dur="2.72">yeah um</text><text start="3312.0" dur="4.16">grants 1.0 was a centralized monolith</text><text start="3313.92" dur="4.72">that only i knew how to maintain and now</text><text start="3316.16" dur="5.199">we&apos;ve got a decentralized uh modular</text><text start="3318.64" dur="4.8">tool with well-documented apis and maybe</text><text start="3321.359" dur="3.601">once that&apos;s out grants2 is out there we</text><text start="3323.44" dur="3.919">could put that out as a

application or an</text><text start="3331.28" dur="3.12">application where if you go to it you</text><text start="3332.64" dur="4.56">can consent to it and it can show you</text><text start="3334.4" dur="6.56">what uh bitcoin grants your community of</text><text start="3337.2" dur="6.0">peers is is funding and and i think that</text><text start="3340.96" dur="3.76">that would be an interesting experiment</text><text start="3343.2" dur="3.599">yeah that would be super cool and that</text><text start="3344.72" dur="3.68">to me is like one of the i mean making</text><text start="3346.799" dur="3.361">these things social i think bitcoin has</text><text start="3348.4" dur="4.48">already done a great job with like</text><text start="3350.16" dur="6.399">tweeting out what you&apos;re donating to and</text><text start="3352.88" dur="5.28">really trying to set this standard of</text><text start="3356.559" dur="2.8">people in this ecosystem donate to</text><text start="3358.16" dur="3.84">public goods</text><text start="3359.359" dur="4.48">is powerful and i think that to me going</text><text start="3362.0" dur="3.76">back to this idea of how do we encode a</text><text start="3363.839" dur="4.561">set of values in this container that</text><text start="3365.76" dur="5.28">that hopefully becomes um</text><text start="3368.4" dur="4.08">emergent and full of thriving ecosystems</text><text start="3371.04" dur="3.12">i think it really becomes like how do we</text><text start="3372.48" dur="3.359">build tools that encourage that type of</text><text start="3374.16" dur="3.36">thing and to me that is that&apos;s a perfect</text><text start="3375.839" dur="3.361">example of that which is just leveraging</text><text start="3377.52" dur="2.72">social behavior to create better</text><text start="3379.2" dur="3.119">outcomes</text><text start="3380.24" dur="4.079">uh so i i think the the next thing i</text><text start="3382.319" dur="4.321">wanted to ask you about was trustware</text><text start="3384.319" dur="4.961">versus social ware so scaling trust in</text><text start="3386.64" dur="4.08">daos or i guess in in digital cities to</text><text start="3389.28" dur="3.68">continue our</text><text start="3390.72" dur="4.8">our metaphor uh tell us tell us about</text><text start="3392.96" dur="4.639">trustwear and social wear</text><text start="3395.52" dur="3.76">yeah this so i i did not come up with</text><text start="3397.599" dur="4.0">trustworthy where julia and john who are</text><text start="3399.28" dur="3.12">co-founders of orca did um</text><text start="3401.599" dur="2.641">but</text><text start="3402.4" dur="4.0">wrote helped write the piece on it which</text><text start="3404.24" dur="3.52">we went through a lot of iterations of</text><text start="3406.4" dur="3.84">we really like</text><text start="3407.76" dur="4.48">took some time to think on this um but</text><text start="3410.24" dur="3.76">the basic idea behind trustworthy and</text><text start="3412.24" dur="3.119">social wear is when you look at the way</text><text start="3414.0" dur="2.4">the dows</text><text start="3415.359" dur="3.841">are</text><text start="3416.4" dur="4.24">going about things today it feels like</text><text start="3419.2" dur="3.84">we&apos;re lacking</text><text start="3420.64" dur="4.719">um terminology to talk about what&apos;s on</text><text start="3423.04" dur="4.559">chain and what&apos;s off chain because you</text><text start="3425.359" dur="3.44">know human organizations that are</text><text start="3427.599" dur="4.321">leveraging</text><text start="3428.799" dur="4.241">blockchains are not exclusively on chain</text><text start="3431.92" dur="2.72">for the most part and we know they</text><text start="3433.04" dur="3.12">probably shouldn&apos;t be like the dow the</text><text start="3434.64" dur="4.56">original dao is a perfect example of</text><text start="3436.16" dur="4.639">this where um part of the reason that it</text><text start="3439.2" dur="3.68">was so challenging was because a lot of</text><text start="3440.799" dur="5.201">people who own the dao token were not</text><text start="3442.88" dur="6.16">going to vote on chain um to sort of</text><text start="3446.0" dur="4.88">stop things when when that was possible</text><text start="3449.04" dur="3.84">and so we know that a lot of things</text><text start="3450.88" dur="4.16">should not be on chain and they can&apos;t be</text><text start="3452.88" dur="3.36">if you want an effective organization</text><text start="3455.04" dur="3.2">at the same time it&apos;s really important</text><text start="3456.24" dur="3.359">to acknowledge what is on chain and and</text><text start="3458.24" dur="2.16">you know there are important pieces to</text><text start="3459.599" dur="2.401">have so</text><text start="3460.4" dur="3.12">we decided to come up with the labels</text><text start="3462.0" dur="3.76">and julie and john came up with them of</text><text start="3463.52" dur="3.52">trustwear and social wear so trustware</text><text start="3465.76" dur="2.4">is basically</text><text start="3467.04" dur="4.16">um</text><text start="3468.16" dur="5.199">assurances that don&apos;t require</text><text start="3471.2" dur="5.2">social relationships</text><text start="3473.359" dur="4.48">to make sure that they are sort of</text><text start="3476.4" dur="4.48">abided by</text><text start="3477.839" dur="6.081">um an example of that would be kevin i</text><text start="3480.88" dur="4.64">send you 500 usdc</text><text start="3483.92" dur="4.08">that&apos;s just like cryptographically</text><text start="3485.52" dur="4.559">secured you don&apos;t need to trust me you</text><text start="3488.0" dur="4.48">just know that i&apos;ve sent you that</text><text start="3490.079" dur="3.52">cool so this is like the like when you</text><text start="3492.48" dur="3.68">get those things they&apos;re like please</text><text start="3493.599" dur="4.561">send me one bitcoin i&apos;ll send it back to</text><text start="3496.16" dur="3.6">you for 1.1 bitcoin that&apos;s exploding an</text><text start="3498.16" dur="2.88">arbitrage between trustware and social</text><text start="3499.76" dur="2.64">wear</text><text start="3501.04" dur="2.16">yes exactly</text><text start="3502.4" dur="2.8">yeah</text><text start="3503.2" dur="4.8">that&apos;s exactly what it is and then so</text><text start="3505.2" dur="4.8">then social wear is requiring some</text><text start="3508.0" dur="3.92">social trust to</text><text start="3510.0" dur="4.16">have that assurance so when we talk</text><text start="3511.92" dur="3.919">about like these bigger systems versus</text><text start="3514.16" dur="2.959">smaller systems and having this</text><text start="3515.839" dur="4.0">reputation layer that holds you</text><text start="3517.119" dur="5.601">accountable that reputation layer is</text><text start="3519.839" dur="5.601">social wear so that&apos;s saying hey i know</text><text start="3522.72" dur="4.96">kevin&apos;s probably if we have a multi-sig</text><text start="3525.44" dur="4.0">that&apos;s a one of two um so it only</text><text start="3527.68" dur="2.96">requires one of us to sign to execute a</text><text start="3529.44" dur="3.84">transaction</text><text start="3530.64" dur="4.32">um that is me saying i trust you enough</text><text start="3533.28" dur="4.0">to not steal the money and your</text><text start="3534.96" dur="4.399">reputation is probably mostly where i&apos;m</text><text start="3537.28" dur="4.559">getting that from the the example that</text><text start="3539.359" dur="4.161">we use in the article is the difference</text><text start="3541.839" dur="4.48">between like a lemonade stand and a</text><text start="3543.52" dur="5.599">vending machine so a lemonade stand</text><text start="3546.319" dur="4.401">you&apos;re using um social relationships and</text><text start="3549.119" dur="4.24">it requires your</text><text start="3550.72" dur="4.399">like presence physically uh ideally to</text><text start="3553.359" dur="3.521">make sure that people don&apos;t steal but</text><text start="3555.119" dur="3.761">the most ultimate version of social wear</text><text start="3556.88" dur="3.52">is one where you&apos;re not even there and</text><text start="3558.88" dur="3.439">you know some people will have like</text><text start="3560.4" dur="3.439">fruit stands or it&apos;s just like hey leave</text><text start="3562.319" dur="2.961">this amount for if you take 12</text><text start="3563.839" dur="2.561">cantaloupes and they just trust that</text><text start="3565.28" dur="2.24">people will</text><text start="3566.4" dur="2.959">whereas you could have like a vending</text><text start="3567.52" dur="3.039">machine where it is basically impossible</text><text start="3569.359" dur="3.841">to get the thing that you want unless</text><text start="3570.559" dur="5.121">you pay for it um which is a lot more</text><text start="3573.2" dur="4.879">like things being on chain something</text><text start="3575.68" dur="4.56">like a molok dao is a little bit closer</text><text start="3578.079" dur="5.361">to that um the</text><text start="3580.24" dur="5.76">the perfect example of that would be um</text><text start="3583.44" dur="4.72">something more like token holders having</text><text start="3586.0" dur="4.0">to vote on something and like having all</text><text start="3588.16" dur="4.48">these things on chain rather than having</text><text start="3590.0" dur="4.24">like snapshot voting for example which</text><text start="3592.64" dur="4.24">is a little bit more</text><text start="3594.24" dur="3.599">trusting snapshot</text><text start="3596.88" dur="2.4">yeah</text><text start="3597.839" dur="2.72">it almost feels like in some of these</text><text start="3599.28" dur="2.799">scenarios</text><text start="3600.559" dur="3.601">that it&apos;s almost like</text><text start="3602.079" dur="4.48">in order to get to social wear it&apos;s like</text><text start="3604.16" dur="4.639">trustware plus your relationship is your</text><text start="3606.559" dur="3.921">collateral or your reputation is your</text><text start="3608.799" dur="3.52">collateral is that a fair way of</text><text start="3610.48" dur="5.28">composing social wear</text><text start="3612.319" dur="6.0">yeah i think that&apos;s a lot of it um</text><text start="3615.76" dur="4.559">i think when we think about like</text><text start="3618.319" dur="4.641">some of the social wear systems it&apos;s</text><text start="3620.319" dur="4.0">your reputation as your collateral um</text><text start="3622.96" dur="2.8">and then also</text><text start="3624.319" dur="2.721">even if you don&apos;t have a perfect</text><text start="3625.76" dur="3.359">reputation</text><text start="3627.04" dur="4.96">system it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="3629.119" dur="4.24">you trust that people will come together</text><text start="3632.0" dur="4.4">to</text><text start="3633.359" dur="5.361">to do the right thing so like an example</text><text start="3636.4" dur="4.48">of this at its core might be</text><text start="3638.72" dur="3.119">the ethereum hard fork as a result of</text><text start="3640.88" dur="2.08">the dow</text><text start="3641.839" dur="3.52">where</text><text start="3642.96" dur="4.08">it didn&apos;t need to be i guess vitalik</text><text start="3645.359" dur="3.2">like technically used his reputation as</text><text start="3647.04" dur="4.079">collateral because he was in favor of</text><text start="3648.559" dur="5.201">doing the fork but um people came</text><text start="3651.119" dur="4.401">together and decided to do the right</text><text start="3653.76" dur="2.64">thing in their eyes</text><text start="3655.52" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="3656.4" dur="3.36">and so i think i&apos;m sure some of that</text><text start="3658.4" dur="2.8">when you actually get into the dirty</text><text start="3659.76" dur="4.0">details was very much based on</text><text start="3661.2" dur="5.04">reputation and some of it wasn&apos;t um but</text><text start="3663.76" dur="5.079">yeah i think it&apos;s that plus trust in</text><text start="3666.24" dur="5.599">humanity to do the right thing</text><text start="3668.839" dur="4.441">yeah yeah and it&apos;s interesting how</text><text start="3671.839" dur="3.28">different people you know ethereum</text><text start="3673.28" dur="3.6">classic their social wear formed a</text><text start="3675.119" dur="3.68">consensus around that was not the right</text><text start="3676.88" dur="4.08">thing and then the ethereum what we now</text><text start="3678.799" dur="4.0">know is the ethereum main chain</text><text start="3680.96" dur="4.159">the the social consensus there is what</text><text start="3682.799" dur="4.161">created the the trustwear off of the</text><text start="3685.119" dur="4.321">ethereum chain so it&apos;s almost like these</text><text start="3686.96" dur="4.0">are two houses of governance in uh</text><text start="3689.44" dur="2.639">agrigore&apos;s aggregators are just</text><text start="3690.96" dur="2.399">collections of humans who think</text><text start="3692.079" dur="2.881">similarly but like these are two</text><text start="3693.359" dur="3.601">different houses of governance for</text><text start="3694.96" dur="3.599">network systems</text><text start="3696.96" dur="3.2">yeah and you you touch on something that</text><text start="3698.559" dur="3.601">i think is interesting when when we were</text><text start="3700.16" dur="4.48">talking about like what does</text><text start="3702.16" dur="4.56">autonomous mean and what&apos;s automated</text><text start="3704.64" dur="4.24">endows and all that stuff i think of a</text><text start="3706.72" dur="4.72">lot of trustware as like technically</text><text start="3708.88" dur="4.56">kind of automation not all of it is but</text><text start="3711.44" dur="4.639">i think the original dow term was very</text><text start="3713.44" dur="4.639">much taking on that idea that some of</text><text start="3716.079" dur="4.801">these things that are on chain</text><text start="3718.079" dur="4.081">um can like trigger other things and you</text><text start="3720.88" dur="2.479">kind of have the sense of like</text><text start="3722.16" dur="2.32">automation</text><text start="3723.359" dur="3.121">i think</text><text start="3724.48" dur="3.119">the reason that i&apos;m like not crazy</text><text start="3726.48" dur="3.76">bullish</text><text start="3727.599" dur="5.041">automation for a lot of dows not some of</text><text start="3730.24" dur="5.599">them totally makes sense but is more so</text><text start="3732.64" dur="5.04">that i think innovation and um settling</text><text start="3735.839" dur="4.48">on best practices tends to happen at the</text><text start="3737.68" dur="4.399">social wear layer just because you have</text><text start="3740.319" dur="3.361">flexibility like you can change those</text><text start="3742.079" dur="3.361">systems pretty easily and you can see</text><text start="3743.68" dur="4.32">how people react</text><text start="3745.44" dur="5.119">and then you turn things into trustware</text><text start="3748.0" dur="5.039">because they can evolve to that point</text><text start="3750.559" dur="4.881">since you know how people</text><text start="3753.039" dur="4.161">interact and it just becomes a lot</text><text start="3755.44" dur="3.599">easier to say yep this system of</text><text start="3757.2" dur="3.28">coordination works for us let&apos;s take it</text><text start="3759.039" dur="2.961">from social wear and just turn it into</text><text start="3760.48" dur="3.599">trustware because</text><text start="3762.0" dur="3.599">it&apos;s easier to scale a system that way</text><text start="3764.079" dur="2.72">for example because you don&apos;t rely on</text><text start="3765.599" dur="4.24">these like</text><text start="3766.799" dur="4.881">reputation systems that are very loose</text><text start="3769.839" dur="4.801">so i think that&apos;s probably how things</text><text start="3771.68" dur="4.56">evolve but there are exceptions to that</text><text start="3774.64" dur="2.719">right</text><text start="3776.24" dur="2.799">um</text><text start="3777.359" dur="3.76">oh man it&apos;s just so</text><text start="3779.039" dur="4.0">it&apos;s it&apos;s easy to start to like once you</text><text start="3781.119" dur="3.361">have trustware and social wear defined</text><text start="3783.039" dur="3.361">as criteria</text><text start="3784.48" dur="4.0">um it&apos;s just so interesting to use that</text><text start="3786.4" dur="4.159">to compose</text><text start="3788.48" dur="3.92">something larger like so basically my my</text><text start="3790.559" dur="2.881">my theory here is that</text><text start="3792.4" dur="3.76">it like the reason why we&apos;re doing</text><text start="3793.44" dur="5.84">season two of green pill on identity is</text><text start="3796.16" dur="4.72">that uh if if web 3 is a dark forest</text><text start="3799.28" dur="3.12">that runs on trustware and you&apos;re not</text><text start="3800.88" dur="3.12">sure who&apos;s going to try to</text><text start="3802.4" dur="3.36">like have an adversarial relationship</text><text start="3804.0" dur="3.28">with you by</text><text start="3805.76" dur="2.799">using the light of identity you can see</text><text start="3807.28" dur="3.36">who your counterparty is and you can</text><text start="3808.559" dur="4.0">start to build social wear and social</text><text start="3810.64" dur="4.56">wear we know from nikki case</text><text start="3812.559" dur="4.401">is key to positive some relationships</text><text start="3815.2" dur="3.52">because you can have mutual win wins</text><text start="3816.96" dur="4.639">with people you have repeat interactions</text><text start="3818.72" dur="4.8">with and so on top of that this is like</text><text start="3821.599" dur="4.161">how you compose from the bottom up a</text><text start="3823.52" dur="5.2">regen movement is that you build</text><text start="3825.76" dur="4.72">positive some games using the composable</text><text start="3828.72" dur="3.76">money legos and identity legos that you</text><text start="3830.48" dur="3.68">have to take trustwear to social wear</text><text start="3832.48" dur="5.04">and that&apos;s how you can invent a positive</text><text start="3834.16" dur="5.28">some positive some game and so you know</text><text start="3837.52" dur="3.2">i guess i&apos;m i&apos;m curious</text><text start="3839.44" dur="2.96">how you what do you think about that</text><text start="3840.72" dur="3.68">that that that stack that i just</text><text start="3842.4" dur="4.0">subscribed described there</text><text start="3844.4" dur="3.919">yeah i think that is what gets me most</text><text start="3846.4" dur="3.919">excited so this is gonna seem kind of</text><text start="3848.319" dur="4.8">unrelated but i think it is the example</text><text start="3850.319" dur="4.161">that i love to use for like pods which</text><text start="3853.119" dur="2.801">is what orca&apos;s building which is</text><text start="3854.48" dur="4.319">basically like a permissions layer on a</text><text start="3855.92" dur="5.28">multi-sig is and i got this from tina</text><text start="3858.799" dur="5.04">from station who&apos;s an absolute genius i</text><text start="3861.2" dur="3.68">absolutely love her is um</text><text start="3863.839" dur="3.601">actually like one of the most</text><text start="3864.88" dur="5.36">interesting use cases is not just like</text><text start="3867.44" dur="4.399">dows use pods to you know have working</text><text start="3870.24" dur="4.879">groups that have their multi-stake it&apos;s</text><text start="3871.839" dur="5.921">actually more that i say i&apos;m willing to</text><text start="3875.119" dur="5.361">lend an undercollateralized loan to</text><text start="3877.76" dur="5.279">anyone in my pod or an adjacent pod up</text><text start="3880.48" dur="5.44">to ten thousand dollars and so what you</text><text start="3883.039" dur="5.601">start to do is basically rely on these</text><text start="3885.92" dur="6.72">like reputational systems more identity</text><text start="3888.64" dur="5.919">layers are part of this um to say there</text><text start="3892.64" dur="4.32">are things that we could not do if we</text><text start="3894.559" dur="4.721">didn&apos;t have this like trust layer but as</text><text start="3896.96" dur="4.72">we start to represent like the it&apos;s</text><text start="3899.28" dur="4.319">almost like the outcome of these things</text><text start="3901.68" dur="3.2">on chain it might not always be like</text><text start="3903.599" dur="4.161">this is my identity and i have this</text><text start="3904.88" dur="5.439">trust score it might be just the outcome</text><text start="3907.76" dur="3.92">being that you kevin trust me it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="3910.319" dur="2.881">need you don&apos;t you might not need to</text><text start="3911.68" dur="2.32">provide justification as to why but you</text><text start="3913.2" dur="3.04">do</text><text start="3914.0" dur="4.24">and then we can start to build on top of</text><text start="3916.24" dur="4.079">that so i think it&apos;s actually</text><text start="3918.24" dur="4.079">weirdly almost like this much more</text><text start="3920.319" dur="3.601">human-centric way of approaching the</text><text start="3922.319" dur="4.0">space because we&apos;re not trying to</text><text start="3923.92" dur="5.36">quantify trust itself</text><text start="3926.319" dur="5.201">we&apos;re trying to like represent trust as</text><text start="3929.28" dur="3.839">it emerges organically and then</text><text start="3931.52" dur="3.44">make sure that we represent that so that</text><text start="3933.119" dur="3.2">we can build these layers on top of it</text><text start="3934.96" dur="2.72">and that i think is actually where you</text><text start="3936.319" dur="3.601">start to see like</text><text start="3937.68" dur="4.08">really wild use cases unfold this gets</text><text start="3939.92" dur="3.919">to the point where we we&apos;ve evolved past</text><text start="3941.76" dur="3.52">the simple system and begun to do really</text><text start="3943.839" dur="3.121">interesting things</text><text start="3945.28" dur="3.2">yeah</text><text start="3946.96" dur="2.879">yeah and i think that you know it&apos;s</text><text start="3948.48" dur="3.52">maybe we&apos;ll take it back to where we</text><text start="3949.839" dur="4.081">started i sort of like envisioned this</text><text start="3952.0" dur="4.559">whole space as</text><text start="3953.92" dur="4.879">an evolutionary game where the byzantine</text><text start="3956.559" dur="3.361">generals problem was solved with bitcoin</text><text start="3958.799" dur="3.04">and then that went through these bull</text><text start="3959.92" dur="3.119">bear epochs of growth and then</text><text start="3961.839" dur="3.041">destruction</text><text start="3963.039" dur="3.121">and then it started to evolve</text><text start="3964.88" dur="2.88">towards bitcoin forks and then</text><text start="3966.16" dur="4.639">eventually ethereum was its own code</text><text start="3967.76" dur="5.039">base and on top of that dalles and defy</text><text start="3970.799" dur="3.841">and in eth was invented and the whole</text><text start="3972.799" dur="3.601">time it&apos;s like the the system is</text><text start="3974.64" dur="3.36">iterating the open source</text><text start="3976.4" dur="4.399">monetary game is iterating and</text><text start="3978.0" dur="6.079">eventually we get l2s and nfts and play</text><text start="3980.799" dur="5.681">to earn and uh dow tooling and dows and</text><text start="3984.079" dur="4.321">regen crypto and it feels what&apos;s really</text><text start="3986.48" dur="4.879">exciting to me is that that that</text><text start="3988.4" dur="4.56">iteration between growth and destruction</text><text start="3991.359" dur="4.641">in the in the infinite garden of</text><text start="3992.96" dur="4.32">ethereum is is basically deciding what</text><text start="3996.0" dur="3.599">projects make it and where like the</text><text start="3997.28" dur="4.48">capital gets gets flowed and what&apos;s</text><text start="3999.599" dur="4.72">really cool to me is this idea that with</text><text start="4001.76" dur="4.24">identity paired with these systems you</text><text start="4004.319" dur="4.161">can create more positive some games</text><text start="4006.0" dur="5.52">which will be evolutionarily advantaged</text><text start="4008.48" dur="5.359">because you can build social wear into</text><text start="4011.52" dur="3.76">the digital economic system so in theory</text><text start="4013.839" dur="3.681">we&apos;ll see like a new part of the</text><text start="4015.28" dur="4.88">infinite garden that will flourish</text><text start="4017.52" dur="5.279">that is more regenerative because of the</text><text start="4020.16" dur="5.199">identity systems and like the way it can</text><text start="4022.799" dur="4.56">route value in more positive some ways</text><text start="4025.359" dur="3.841">so i i know i&apos;m trying to integrate the</text><text start="4027.359" dur="3.76">entire podcast into one little monologue</text><text start="4029.2" dur="3.599">here but like evolution time simple</text><text start="4031.119" dur="3.281">instruction set and what we just added</text><text start="4032.799" dur="3.04">to the simple instruction set is social</text><text start="4034.4" dur="2.639">wear uh</text><text start="4035.839" dur="2.641">i think</text><text start="4037.039" dur="3.52">yeah i think</text><text start="4038.48" dur="3.28">i think what we&apos;ve seen so far is that a</text><text start="4040.559" dur="3.441">lot of</text><text start="4041.76" dur="4.48">crypto&apos;s evolution has had a pretty</text><text start="4044.0" dur="4.799">limited data set which is mostly reliant</text><text start="4046.24" dur="5.119">on trustware and a little bit of the</text><text start="4048.799" dur="4.8">social wear that like crypto twitter and</text><text start="4051.359" dur="4.161">human relationships have provided and i</text><text start="4053.599" dur="3.121">think what&apos;s like building off of what</text><text start="4055.52" dur="2.96">you&apos;re talking about what&apos;s really</text><text start="4056.72" dur="4.079">exciting about adding in the identity</text><text start="4058.48" dur="5.52">layer and the social wear stuff is that</text><text start="4060.799" dur="6.24">it basically creates an entirely</text><text start="4064.0" dur="6.079">new like type of data that we&apos;re adding</text><text start="4067.039" dur="4.881">into this like evolutionary system where</text><text start="4070.079" dur="4.0">you know we could like it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="4071.92" dur="4.24">we could see in here but now we&apos;re</text><text start="4074.079" dur="4.24">suddenly able to touch and taste and</text><text start="4076.16" dur="3.84">we&apos;re like whoa this is a whole nother</text><text start="4078.319" dur="3.76">thing that we weren&apos;t even able to use</text><text start="4080.0" dur="3.92">as an input or</text><text start="4082.079" dur="4.24">measure as an output that we&apos;re now able</text><text start="4083.92" dur="5.199">to do and i think that is like what&apos;s</text><text start="4086.319" dur="5.52">most exciting about the identity layer</text><text start="4089.119" dur="4.0">and all of that stuff is it it creates</text><text start="4091.839" dur="4.4">this new</text><text start="4093.119" dur="5.6">um like set of data that has always</text><text start="4096.239" dur="4.96">existed in these systems but we were</text><text start="4098.719" dur="6.161">never able to quantify and so it was</text><text start="4101.199" dur="6.08">really really hard to build like complex</text><text start="4104.88" dur="4.24">really um innovative systems because we</text><text start="4107.279" dur="4.0">were just like this is all we have like</text><text start="4109.12" dur="4.8">we only have people who are able to spin</text><text start="4111.279" dur="3.761">up you know um random accounts and like</text><text start="4113.92" dur="3.2">we have no way of tracking them and all</text><text start="4115.04" dur="3.84">the stuff so i think i think to me</text><text start="4117.12" dur="3.44">that&apos;s like the really exciting pieces</text><text start="4118.88" dur="3.6">to your point introducing the social</text><text start="4120.56" dur="4.159">wear layer in and basically giving</text><text start="4122.48" dur="5.279">ourselves like new senses that allow us</text><text start="4124.719" dur="4.56">to evolve um not just faster and more</text><text start="4127.759" dur="3.92">effectively but also into something</text><text start="4129.279" dur="4.161">that&apos;s actually like a lot more exciting</text><text start="4131.679" dur="4.56">and honestly something that&apos;s much more</text><text start="4133.44" dur="5.04">reflective of what it means to thrive as</text><text start="4136.239" dur="4.401">a human because if the only thing that</text><text start="4138.48" dur="4.0">it means to thrive is to be wealthy we</text><text start="4140.64" dur="4.559">will fail completely</text><text start="4142.48" dur="4.48">uh so so get coin just released get coin</text><text start="4145.199" dur="4.881">passport and</text><text start="4146.96" dur="4.56">uh i i i&apos;m just a contributor at the dao</text><text start="4150.08" dur="3.04">i&apos;m not involved in the leadership right</text><text start="4151.52" dur="3.279">now but i i have been following some of</text><text start="4153.12" dur="2.88">the strategy there and it&apos;s basically</text><text start="4154.799" dur="2.88">what it&apos;s doing is it&apos;s taking</text><text start="4156.0" dur="3.359">decentralized society all of this</text><text start="4157.679" dur="2.721">on-chain and off-chain data about</text><text start="4159.359" dur="2.721">reputation</text><text start="4160.4" dur="4.16">and then it&apos;s etling it which just means</text><text start="4162.08" dur="4.079">extract transform load into a verifiable</text><text start="4164.56" dur="3.199">credential that&apos;s stored on ceramic</text><text start="4166.159" dur="3.761">self-sovereign owned by the passport</text><text start="4167.759" dur="3.92">users and then from there anyone can</text><text start="4169.92" dur="3.919">write an algorithm that right that turns</text><text start="4171.679" dur="3.921">that into a one-dimensional score in the</text><text start="4173.839" dur="3.681">case of get coin passport it&apos;s civil</text><text start="4175.6" dur="4.079">resistance how can we prove that you&apos;re</text><text start="4177.52" dur="4.239">a unique identity and your personal</text><text start="4179.679" dur="4.401">score is equal to the cost of forgery of</text><text start="4181.759" dur="3.761">your identity so if if you have an id</text><text start="4184.08" dur="4.56">worth ten dollars then you can get ten</text><text start="4185.52" dur="4.719">dollars worth of rewards using passport</text><text start="4188.64" dur="2.8">and if you have a thousand dollars you</text><text start="4190.239" dur="3.04">have a thousand dollars worth of civil</text><text start="4191.44" dur="4.48">resistance in your identity and it just</text><text start="4193.279" dur="5.121">scales up and down from there so i i</text><text start="4195.92" dur="5.6">guess you know</text><text start="4198.4" dur="4.0">i i i don&apos;t know uh i have two questions</text><text start="4201.52" dur="2.32">one</text><text start="4202.4" dur="3.2">you know have you followed what&apos;s the</text><text start="4203.84" dur="3.359">most important reputation score for you</text><text start="4205.6" dur="4.079">because get coin is focused on civil</text><text start="4207.199" dur="5.121">resistance and what do you think about</text><text start="4209.679" dur="4.961">like creating that pipeline of</text><text start="4212.32" dur="4.64">decentralized society information into</text><text start="4214.64" dur="4.559">into into scores is there any sort of</text><text start="4216.96" dur="4.16">pitfalls that you see there or what are</text><text start="4219.199" dur="4.0">the opportunities with</text><text start="4221.12" dur="4.079">with with using reputation systems in</text><text start="4223.199" dur="5.281">this way</text><text start="4225.199" dur="5.761">i think the idea of saying</text><text start="4228.48" dur="5.36">each like bitcoin passport has a</text><text start="4230.96" dur="4.56">specific implementation of something</text><text start="4233.84" dur="5.28">that is its own</text><text start="4235.52" dur="5.679">score that is basically trying to</text><text start="4239.12" dur="3.52">collapse context and say here&apos;s the not</text><text start="4241.199" dur="3.681">collapse context but take a lot of</text><text start="4242.64" dur="3.92">context and say here is something here&apos;s</text><text start="4244.88" dur="4.319">a number a way to quantify something</text><text start="4246.56" dur="4.8">with a very specific scope is like a</text><text start="4249.199" dur="4.561">very smart approach again because i</text><text start="4251.36" dur="3.68">think identity is very contextual</text><text start="4253.76" dur="3.28">um</text><text start="4255.04" dur="4.8">i think civil resistance is going to</text><text start="4257.04" dur="5.76">provide one of the biggest opportunities</text><text start="4259.84" dur="5.04">when it comes to things like governance</text><text start="4262.8" dur="3.12">and innovating on that level like i</text><text start="4264.88" dur="3.12">think when you think about civil</text><text start="4265.92" dur="3.92">resistance in the beginning</text><text start="4268.0" dur="4.4">when you just try to go okay well why is</text><text start="4269.84" dur="4.8">that useful um you could come up with</text><text start="4272.4" dur="3.04">like reasonably good</text><text start="4274.64" dur="1.76">um</text><text start="4275.44" dur="3.279">you know</text><text start="4276.4" dur="4.72">sets of use cases but i think where it</text><text start="4278.719" dur="3.761">actually gets like really exciting is</text><text start="4281.12" dur="3.28">when you need to do things like</text><text start="4282.48" dur="3.36">governance on chain and all that stuff</text><text start="4284.4" dur="3.6">sort of like these second order effects</text><text start="4285.84" dur="4.399">where you wouldn&apos;t think of it until you</text><text start="4288.0" dur="4.719">really need it and then you&apos;re like oh</text><text start="4290.239" dur="4.161">we have no way of knowing</text><text start="4292.719" dur="3.041">what&apos;s going on and also we can&apos;t</text><text start="4294.4" dur="3.44">experiment with many different</text><text start="4295.76" dur="4.0">governance mechanisms because the only</text><text start="4297.84" dur="4.08">proxy that we have for civil resistance</text><text start="4299.76" dur="4.56">right now is basically money which is a</text><text start="4301.92" dur="3.68">terrible proxy but that&apos;s</text><text start="4304.32" dur="3.2">that&apos;s really the only thing that we can</text><text start="4305.6" dur="3.599">do it&apos;s actually worth like just double</text><text start="4307.52" dur="2.96">clicking on that the most dystopian</text><text start="4309.199" dur="2.96">outcome is that you have to have a lot</text><text start="4310.48" dur="4.48">of money to have personhood and that&apos;s</text><text start="4312.159" dur="4.241">not what you want to build at all 100</text><text start="4314.96" dur="3.199">and i think you could argue that we&apos;ve</text><text start="4316.4" dur="3.04">kind of done that in the ecosystem thus</text><text start="4318.159" dur="3.681">far where</text><text start="4319.44" dur="4.0">one token one vote is basically you have</text><text start="4321.84" dur="4.08">to have a lot of money to have your</text><text start="4323.44" dur="3.36">voice heard and i think that&apos;s a pretty</text><text start="4325.92" dur="3.36">bad</text><text start="4326.8" dur="3.84">outcome i even think i would go further</text><text start="4329.28" dur="2.64">to say that it&apos;s not just you have to</text><text start="4330.64" dur="4.0">have a lot of money to have your voice</text><text start="4331.92" dur="4.16">heard and airdrops are solving that it&apos;s</text><text start="4334.64" dur="4.0">actually the airdrops only make that</text><text start="4336.08" dur="4.079">worse because they make people think</text><text start="4338.64" dur="2.88">that but the reality is that again</text><text start="4340.159" dur="2.56">people have to sell their tokens because</text><text start="4341.52" dur="3.6">they need to pay rent and so you</text><text start="4342.719" dur="4.48">actually end up with the same system so</text><text start="4345.12" dur="3.52">i think like civil resistance to me and</text><text start="4347.199" dur="3.681">a lot of where where i&apos;ve been thinking</text><text start="4348.64" dur="5.28">about it is in the context of how can we</text><text start="4350.88" dur="6.0">build systems that are more fair and do</text><text start="4353.92" dur="3.92">provide opportunities for everyone to</text><text start="4356.88" dur="2.64">um</text><text start="4357.84" dur="3.04">to have their voice heard and all these</text><text start="4359.52" dur="2.8">different pieces</text><text start="4360.88" dur="2.799">um so to me that&apos;s like the most</text><text start="4362.32" dur="2.8">exciting i think civil resistance is</text><text start="4363.679" dur="3.201">probably the first element of identity</text><text start="4365.12" dur="4.24">that&apos;s going to be really important i do</text><text start="4366.88" dur="4.56">think the second one is is probably</text><text start="4369.36" dur="4.799">going to be figuring out</text><text start="4371.44" dur="4.719">two pieces one i know people talk a lot</text><text start="4374.159" dur="4.08">about skill sets</text><text start="4376.159" dur="3.681">i don&apos;t know if identity and skill sets</text><text start="4378.239" dur="4.561">are going to be like the top thing that</text><text start="4379.84" dur="5.12">we need right now because again i think</text><text start="4382.8" dur="4.16">skill sets are incredibly contextual</text><text start="4384.96" dur="3.199">like how you rate someone&apos;s development</text><text start="4386.96" dur="3.68">skills is going to be very different</text><text start="4388.159" dur="5.361">from how i do and that matters i think a</text><text start="4390.64" dur="4.16">lot is really hard to quantify um</text><text start="4393.52" dur="3.76">i&apos;m very interested in seeing</text><text start="4394.8" dur="5.359">relationally how reputation systems</text><text start="4397.28" dur="4.959">develop in when i say that i mean like</text><text start="4400.159" dur="3.52">how easy is someone to work with i</text><text start="4402.239" dur="3.681">actually think is going to be more</text><text start="4403.679" dur="3.921">important than</text><text start="4405.92" dur="3.759">how good they are at something how good</text><text start="4407.6" dur="4.16">someone is that something can change i</text><text start="4409.679" dur="4.321">actually in my experience have seen that</text><text start="4411.76" dur="4.399">dows more often fail not because people</text><text start="4414.0" dur="4.88">can&apos;t do something but because they are</text><text start="4416.159" dur="4.241">incredibly hard the the two two people</text><text start="4418.88" dur="2.799">are not getting along and don&apos;t work</text><text start="4420.4" dur="4.0">well together and it&apos;s actually really</text><text start="4421.679" dur="3.761">hard and that creates more attention so</text><text start="4424.4" dur="3.68">i don&apos;t think we&apos;ll have a solution to</text><text start="4425.44" dur="4.239">that anytime soon but i do think that</text><text start="4428.08" dur="3.04">reputation systems that can start to</text><text start="4429.679" dur="5.121">play on that</text><text start="4431.12" dur="3.68">are going to be really interesting</text><text start="4435.04" dur="4.08">yeah it does seem like there&apos;s just like</text><text start="4437.12" dur="3.44">so many different vectors of reputation</text><text start="4439.12" dur="3.039">and it seems like we&apos;re starting with</text><text start="4440.56" dur="5.119">civil resistance but there&apos;s just many</text><text start="4442.159" dur="5.04">many more to consider here and</text><text start="4445.679" dur="3.841">i&apos;m wondering how we spin that flywheel</text><text start="4447.199" dur="5.641">of like more data and more reputation</text><text start="4449.52" dur="5.679">scores which enables more daps and</text><text start="4452.84" dur="4.04">it feels like there&apos;s a network effect</text><text start="4455.199" dur="4.0">here to the to bootstrap where it&apos;s like</text><text start="4456.88" dur="4.16">no one has dids and vcs so no d ops give</text><text start="4459.199" dur="3.921">a about that and so therefore</text><text start="4461.04" dur="4.56">there&apos;s no use cases for it and there&apos;s</text><text start="4463.12" dur="3.2">the cold start problem so i&apos;m interested</text><text start="4465.6" dur="3.44">to</text><text start="4466.32" dur="4.56">to sort of start playing with that</text><text start="4469.04" dur="3.36">yeah i am uh</text><text start="4470.88" dur="3.76">i&apos;m very intrigued to see how part of</text><text start="4472.4" dur="4.0">that happens and unfortunately i i can&apos;t</text><text start="4474.64" dur="3.68">remember who&apos;s has said this to me i</text><text start="4476.4" dur="3.759">think a couple of people but one of the</text><text start="4478.32" dur="4.0">big um</text><text start="4480.159" dur="5.04">things of the last decade has just been</text><text start="4482.32" dur="4.16">that vanity this is a very pessimistic</text><text start="4485.199" dur="4.321">take that i don&apos;t think i fully agree</text><text start="4486.48" dur="5.679">with but um basically like vanity and</text><text start="4489.52" dur="3.84">the desire to um</text><text start="4492.159" dur="2.801">flaunt</text><text start="4493.36" dur="3.28">have become more important to people</text><text start="4494.96" dur="4.08">than privacy</text><text start="4496.64" dur="4.24">and i do wonder if that same dynamic</text><text start="4499.04" dur="3.52">will come into play here</text><text start="4500.88" dur="4.96">not in the sense of privacy but in</text><text start="4502.56" dur="4.48">saying the desire to flaunt and sort of</text><text start="4505.84" dur="3.28">show off</text><text start="4507.04" dur="4.88">actually ends up being like the trojan</text><text start="4509.12" dur="6.079">horse for identity and for</text><text start="4511.92" dur="6.08">not only users identifying with some set</text><text start="4515.199" dur="3.761">of you know vcs and all that stuff but</text><text start="4518.0" dur="3.199">also</text><text start="4518.96" dur="3.279">helping build like this relational</text><text start="4521.199" dur="2.241">network</text><text start="4522.239" dur="3.44">where like</text><text start="4523.44" dur="3.6">i show off</text><text start="4525.679" dur="3.761">a bunch of different things or even that</text><text start="4527.04" dur="3.199">i need to have um</text><text start="4529.44" dur="5.04">some</text><text start="4530.239" dur="6.801">proof that i am a real human in order to</text><text start="4534.48" dur="3.44">get something that i care about that is</text><text start="4537.04" dur="2.72">like</text><text start="4537.92" dur="4.0">that&apos;s more in the sense of like me</text><text start="4539.76" dur="3.6">showing off so i don&apos;t know i&apos;m very</text><text start="4541.92" dur="2.4">interested in how we can take some of</text><text start="4543.36" dur="1.76">those</text><text start="4544.32" dur="3.28">the</text><text start="4545.12" dur="4.88">more negative or i guess not as like</text><text start="4547.6" dur="6.8">optimistic ways that humans exist in</text><text start="4550.0" dur="5.92">general and use those to our advantage</text><text start="4554.4" dur="3.839">yeah it&apos;s interesting</text><text start="4555.92" dur="4.16">you know i definitely think that the web</text><text start="4558.239" dur="4.561">has increased</text><text start="4560.08" dur="4.8">the propensity for vanity and you know</text><text start="4562.8" dur="3.68">since all information is now infinitely</text><text start="4564.88" dur="4.64">replicable</text><text start="4566.48" dur="4.32">privacy has suffered from that and you</text><text start="4569.52" dur="3.44">know it&apos;s almost like the transition</text><text start="4570.8" dur="4.32">from atoms to bits enabled</text><text start="4572.96" dur="3.92">this whole thing to be unleashed of of</text><text start="4575.12" dur="4.559">us all sort of trying to broadcast our</text><text start="4576.88" dur="4.4">image and and in this sort of like</text><text start="4579.679" dur="2.961">narcissism and that comes along with</text><text start="4581.28" dur="3.28">that or just like you know the wanting</text><text start="4582.64" dur="4.64">to get rewards and not realizing the the</text><text start="4584.56" dur="4.72">externality to your privacy later but uh</text><text start="4587.28" dur="4.0">it feels like even higher stakes when</text><text start="4589.28" dur="3.68">it&apos;s on on blockchains</text><text start="4591.28" dur="3.84">also so treading with caution maybe is</text><text start="4592.96" dur="4.4">the lesson there yeah trending with</text><text start="4595.12" dur="4.24">caution and i think um</text><text start="4597.36" dur="3.44">leveraging the fact that we are like</text><text start="4599.36" dur="4.48">that for</text><text start="4600.8" dur="4.96">positive some outcomes and being very</text><text start="4603.84" dur="3.44">clear that that&apos;s i think a big thing is</text><text start="4605.76" dur="2.88">like transparency that that&apos;s actually</text><text start="4607.28" dur="4.8">what you&apos;re doing</text><text start="4608.64" dur="5.36">um but like i am very optimistic that</text><text start="4612.08" dur="5.2">if we can if we can take ways that we</text><text start="4614.0" dur="5.84">know humans already act and try to use</text><text start="4617.28" dur="3.919">that as the trojan horse for</text><text start="4619.84" dur="4.16">improving</text><text start="4621.199" dur="3.681">creating like net positive outcomes</text><text start="4624.0" dur="2.4">um</text><text start="4624.88" dur="4.24">i think that&apos;s a</text><text start="4626.4" dur="4.08">battle worth fighting</text><text start="4629.12" dur="3.2">yeah</text><text start="4630.48" dur="3.28">yeah it feels like it&apos;s coming it&apos;s</text><text start="4632.32" dur="3.04">coming up as we&apos;re designing all of</text><text start="4633.76" dur="4.16">these new things with dallas also we&apos;re</text><text start="4635.36" dur="4.879">crossing that skeuomorphic frontier</text><text start="4637.92" dur="3.92">oh my gosh yeah well and i think like</text><text start="4640.239" dur="4.241">one of the most important elements too</text><text start="4641.84" dur="4.8">and and back to your your question i</text><text start="4644.48" dur="4.08">think the flywheel will probably be i</text><text start="4646.64" dur="4.24">guess what i am ultimately getting at is</text><text start="4648.56" dur="3.119">social like i think</text><text start="4650.88" dur="2.96">yeah</text><text start="4651.679" dur="3.761">humans love</text><text start="4653.84" dur="4.319">to</text><text start="4655.44" dur="4.96">engage with each other and as we do move</text><text start="4658.159" dur="3.201">more into this like digital city sort of</text><text start="4660.4" dur="2.64">space</text><text start="4661.36" dur="3.12">um one of the most interesting things</text><text start="4663.04" dur="4.0">about these types of cities is the</text><text start="4664.48" dur="4.64">subcultures that pop up and all of the</text><text start="4667.04" dur="4.0">different like economic hubs that cities</text><text start="4669.12" dur="3.599">provide and and the entropy of running</text><text start="4671.04" dur="3.84">into someone random and stuff like that</text><text start="4672.719" dur="4.801">i think we&apos;re going to crave that we</text><text start="4674.88" dur="4.72">already do crave that in digital spaces</text><text start="4677.52" dur="3.84">if we can use identity as a layer to</text><text start="4679.6" dur="3.44">create really rich experiences that</text><text start="4681.36" dur="3.76">actually make people</text><text start="4683.04" dur="3.36">feel more connected i think people will</text><text start="4685.12" dur="2.8">always</text><text start="4686.4" dur="3.759">want that</text><text start="4687.92" dur="2.239">right</text><text start="4690.84" dur="3.24">yeah</text><text start="4692.4" dur="3.12">yeah i think that they&apos;ll</text><text start="4694.08" dur="2.96">they&apos;ll want it&apos;s just it&apos;s going to</text><text start="4695.52" dur="3.84">take a lot of capital and talent i think</text><text start="4697.04" dur="5.04">an experimentation to bootstrap</text><text start="4699.36" dur="4.72">that flywheel um but</text><text start="4702.08" dur="3.599">you know the i think that what what the</text><text start="4704.08" dur="3.92">ecosystem maybe could aim for and this</text><text start="4705.679" dur="4.401">is for the listeners is you know when</text><text start="4708.0" dur="3.44">when axi blew up that&apos;s when everyone</text><text start="4710.08" dur="2.72">tried to build play or play to earn</text><text start="4711.44" dur="3.2">games like the one example that&apos;s</text><text start="4712.8" dur="3.439">proving that it&apos;s possible creates a</text><text start="4714.64" dur="4.079">selling point for so many entrepreneurs</text><text start="4716.239" dur="4.241">capital and talent to to follow that so</text><text start="4718.719" dur="4.48">i guess we&apos;re all just kind of looking</text><text start="4720.48" dur="5.12">for that that that first solution and</text><text start="4723.199" dur="3.601">and i&apos;ve seen glimmers between poep and</text><text start="4725.6" dur="3.04">rabbit hole</text><text start="4726.8" dur="3.84">and get coin</text><text start="4728.64" dur="3.44">and you know a lot of these other</text><text start="4730.64" dur="3.12">applications that are actually creating</text><text start="4732.08" dur="3.28">the data emissions that it could</text><text start="4733.76" dur="3.76">possibly be bootstrapped lens protocol</text><text start="4735.36" dur="3.68">is a great example</text><text start="4737.52" dur="2.88">yeah i think and what&apos;s interesting is</text><text start="4739.04" dur="3.04">that those all get at it in different</text><text start="4740.4" dur="3.92">ways which i think is really important</text><text start="4742.08" dur="6.079">like rabbit hole is helping people</text><text start="4744.32" dur="5.6">explore web 3 and in doing that you&apos;re</text><text start="4748.159" dur="4.241">going to get a certain set of skills and</text><text start="4749.92" dur="4.239">credentials lens is helping people build</text><text start="4752.4" dur="2.96">their brand and in doing that you&apos;re</text><text start="4754.159" dur="2.56">going to build up a certain set of</text><text start="4755.36" dur="2.56">credentials so</text><text start="4756.719" dur="4.241">it&apos;s going to be super interesting to</text><text start="4757.92" dur="4.96">see how fragmented the identity sort of</text><text start="4760.96" dur="4.64">space ends up being because there&apos;s so</text><text start="4762.88" dur="4.48">many different things that that it means</text><text start="4765.6" dur="3.2">to be you as a human and i think that&apos;s</text><text start="4767.36" dur="3.6">probably also part of what makes it so</text><text start="4768.8" dur="3.68">hard to track also a civil resistance</text><text start="4770.96" dur="3.6">makes the most sense proving that</text><text start="4772.48" dur="3.199">someone is a human is really hard but</text><text start="4774.56" dur="2.0">it&apos;s a lot</text><text start="4775.679" dur="3.52">less</text><text start="4776.56" dur="4.48">there are a lot less moving factors than</text><text start="4779.199" dur="4.641">trying to help someone express</text><text start="4781.04" dur="4.56">themselves on the internet you know like</text><text start="4783.84" dur="3.92">it&apos;s just there&apos;s so many moving factors</text><text start="4785.6" dur="5.2">when it comes to who you are and at</text><text start="4787.76" dur="5.2">least personhood is like a binary yes no</text><text start="4790.8" dur="3.6">yeah well you would think so</text><text start="4792.96" dur="2.239">it should take you behind the rabbit</text><text start="4794.4" dur="3.36">hole</text><text start="4795.199" dur="4.321">i am the civil resistance yeah i&apos;m sure</text><text start="4797.76" dur="2.959">well i&apos;d i would love to pull that</text><text start="4799.52" dur="3.04">thread with you and there&apos;s so many more</text><text start="4800.719" dur="3.52">threads here but we&apos;re getting it to a</text><text start="4802.56" dur="4.32">place where we have to converge uh</text><text start="4804.239" dur="4.321">instead of diverging so uh i think i&apos;ll</text><text start="4806.88" dur="4.16">ask you one question which is completely</text><text start="4808.56" dur="3.84">open-ended so that you can uh take us in</text><text start="4811.04" dur="3.04">any direction that you want before we</text><text start="4812.4" dur="3.279">wrap which is if there is there anything</text><text start="4814.08" dur="2.76">i didn&apos;t ask you that you want to say</text><text start="4815.679" dur="2.801">chase</text><text start="4816.84" dur="3.64">chapman</text><text start="4818.48" dur="3.679">i don&apos;t think so this has been a really</text><text start="4820.48" dur="4.32">fun um</text><text start="4822.159" dur="4.161">a really fun conversation i i do think</text><text start="4824.8" dur="3.12">one quick thing</text><text start="4826.32" dur="3.919">that i was thinking about in prep for</text><text start="4827.92" dur="3.92">this on favorite public goods this is</text><text start="4830.239" dur="3.601">totally unrelated but i have to shout it</text><text start="4831.84" dur="4.72">out one of the most underrated public</text><text start="4833.84" dur="5.28">goods i think that is out there is the</text><text start="4836.56" dur="4.72">people who are like scam researchers and</text><text start="4839.12" dur="4.88">hold people accountable i think like</text><text start="4841.28" dur="4.64">zack xbt is a perfect example of this</text><text start="4844.0" dur="3.6">because i was i was like oh which grants</text><text start="4845.92" dur="3.44">have i donated to like</text><text start="4847.6" dur="3.52">you know whatever because i was thinking</text><text start="4849.36" dur="3.68">about it and i totally forget about this</text><text start="4851.12" dur="3.36">but then i see things on twitter</text><text start="4853.04" dur="3.92">transparency means nothing if you don&apos;t</text><text start="4854.48" dur="3.44">hold people accountable for this stuff</text><text start="4856.96" dur="2.96">and</text><text start="4857.92" dur="3.759">i think that is like such an underrated</text><text start="4859.92" dur="3.12">public good but i just have to shout out</text><text start="4861.679" dur="2.721">because i think it&apos;s really important</text><text start="4863.04" dur="4.56">and i&apos;m very grateful for people who do</text><text start="4864.4" dur="6.08">it yeah i&apos;ve actually uh 100 agree with</text><text start="4867.6" dur="3.84">you plus one plus 100 been sort of i&apos;ve</text><text start="4870.48" dur="2.4">been thinking about like how do you</text><text start="4871.44" dur="2.799">create a more green-pilled world you</text><text start="4872.88" dur="3.2">know the subtitle of the book is how</text><text start="4874.239" dur="3.201">crypto could regenerate the world and we</text><text start="4876.08" dur="3.68">really want to go to how crypto is</text><text start="4877.44" dur="4.56">regenerating the world from there and</text><text start="4879.76" dur="3.68">the first answer is do no harm before</text><text start="4882.0" dur="3.44">you create positive externalities and</text><text start="4883.44" dur="3.92">the biggest harms are the environmental</text><text start="4885.44" dur="2.96">impact which you know given the merge is</text><text start="4887.36" dur="4.24">gonna go away</text><text start="4888.4" dur="6.239">but the ponzi schemes that collapse on</text><text start="4891.6" dur="5.28">top of everyone damage retail investors</text><text start="4894.639" dur="3.841">which damages the sentiment of the space</text><text start="4896.88" dur="3.92">and it creates a massive negative</text><text start="4898.48" dur="3.679">externality for web3 and the people who</text><text start="4900.8" dur="3.839">are trying to prevent that by</text><text start="4902.159" dur="4.48">researching the scams actually increase</text><text start="4904.639" dur="3.921">the credibility of the space massively</text><text start="4906.639" dur="4.641">which is a public good and the people</text><text start="4908.56" dur="4.159">who want to regulate crypto really want</text><text start="4911.28" dur="2.8">to prevent those retail investors from</text><text
