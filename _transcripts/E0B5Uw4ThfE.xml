start="190.379" dur="5.401">hey man good to see you again yeah great</text><text start="193.319" dur="4.261">to have you um so I remember just this</text><text start="195.78" dur="3.179">really going on for a hike with you when</text><text start="197.58" dur="4.2">I was writing the green pill book and we</text><text start="198.959" dur="4.741">were talking about our various regen uh</text><text start="201.78" dur="4.14">uh feces so maybe I&apos;ll just Tee It Off</text><text start="203.7" dur="4.92">with an extremely broad question how can</text><text start="205.92" dur="4.92">we web3 regenerate the world</text><text start="208.62" dur="3.96">oh man that&apos;s a big one too it&apos;s a good</text><text start="210.84" dur="2.72">thing I gave this talk many times this</text><text start="212.58" dur="4.32">year</text><text start="213.56" dur="5.38">uh so like this reminds me of probably</text><text start="216.9" dur="4.02">the one I did at eath Barcelona where it</text><text start="218.94" dur="3.78">was like I think it was legit that title</text><text start="220.92" dur="4.379">was like how can web3 regenerate the</text><text start="222.72" dur="4.62">world or something you know really</text><text start="225.299" dur="3.8">um you know think boy like that but</text><text start="227.34" dur="4.2">basically uh</text><text start="229.099" dur="4.78">how can it I think it&apos;s a number of</text><text start="231.54" dur="4.08">things man but one like</text><text start="233.879" dur="3.241">um you know when I&apos;m explaining this to</text><text start="235.62" dur="3.42">other investors or to people like what</text><text start="237.12" dur="4.44">the hell is refi I&apos;m like well</text><text start="239.04" dur="4.08">basically you have this economy that</text><text start="241.56" dur="3.06">exists that doesn&apos;t really give a</text><text start="243.12" dur="2.64">about do we do you cuss in this podcast</text><text start="244.62" dur="4.32">by the way I should have asked that</text><text start="245.76" dur="5.64">first not not gratuitously but sometimes</text><text start="248.94" dur="4.379">yeah yeah cool so I think this is this</text><text start="251.4" dur="3.839">is apt you know like this economy really</text><text start="253.319" dur="4.681">doesn&apos;t give a about it&apos;s hard to</text><text start="255.239" dur="4.441">make it care about people about uh</text><text start="258.0" dur="4.139">carbon dioxide about you know</text><text start="259.68" dur="6.2">environmental degradation and stuff like</text><text start="262.139" dur="7.5">that so what we call the externalities</text><text start="265.88" dur="5.74">yeah exactly and wouldn&apos;t it be great if</text><text start="269.639" dur="3.661">we could design a system that could</text><text start="271.62" dur="4.32">internalize some of those externalities</text><text start="273.3" dur="4.26">price them and make it such that we</text><text start="275.94" dur="3.6">could decide make decisions about how</text><text start="277.56" dur="4.68">much of them we want or don&apos;t want all</text><text start="279.54" dur="4.439">right so I think that when you really</text><text start="282.24" dur="3.72">dig into that sentence and you&apos;re like</text><text start="283.979" dur="3.66">well what what does that actually have</text><text start="285.96" dur="4.26">to do with web3 there&apos;s some things that</text><text start="287.639" dur="4.201">stand out right you need accounting uh</text><text start="290.22" dur="4.199">you need the ability to make some things</text><text start="291.84" dur="4.32">legible that aren&apos;t you need to have one</text><text start="294.419" dur="4.981">of the proven web three cases which is</text><text start="296.16" dur="5.58">just uh being able to trade or have</text><text start="299.4" dur="5.04">markets and stuff that&apos;s actually one of</text><text start="301.74" dur="4.38">our really well proven out use cases</text><text start="304.44" dur="3.9">um basically you put all those things</text><text start="306.12" dur="3.9">together and I just like to say that we</text><text start="308.34" dur="3.12">need more people in the space we need</text><text start="310.02" dur="2.88">more money in the space and we need to</text><text start="311.46" dur="4.38">turn those things to positive ends</text><text start="312.9" dur="5.28">positive summons right</text><text start="315.84" dur="5.1">so it seems like kind of price the</text><text start="318.18" dur="4.14">externalities put them into a market and</text><text start="320.94" dur="5.22">then try to internalize some of those</text><text start="322.32" dur="5.7">externalities into the economy and then</text><text start="326.16" dur="4.5">once it&apos;s proven that that can be work</text><text start="328.02" dur="4.619">working in one place then channeling</text><text start="330.66" dur="4.02">more talent and capital and resources</text><text start="332.639" dur="6.06">into market pricing lots of different</text><text start="334.68" dur="5.64">externalities and then you know once the</text><text start="338.699" dur="4.321">market is pricing them and then there&apos;s</text><text start="340.32" dur="5.099">there&apos;s money flowing into into</text><text start="343.02" dur="4.56">correcting whatever asymmetry was wrong</text><text start="345.419" dur="3.601">with the externalities then you&apos;re</text><text start="347.58" dur="3.36">starting to have web 3 regenerate the</text><text start="349.02" dur="4.32">world and bring in the things that it</text><text start="350.94" dur="4.56">was not otherwise is that a valid</text><text start="353.34" dur="3.66">summary yeah I think so when the the big</text><text start="355.5" dur="4.74">part that I left out which I&apos;m always</text><text start="357.0" dur="4.5">actually embarrassed that I did uh is</text><text start="360.24" dur="2.82">one of the things that I think you and I</text><text start="361.5" dur="4.08">I&apos;ve done early too is just ownership</text><text start="363.06" dur="5.06">too like making sure that all of the</text><text start="365.58" dur="5.58">people who are involved in these systems</text><text start="368.12" dur="4.9">uh one have governance systems that kind</text><text start="371.16" dur="3.96">of reflect their participation in a</text><text start="373.02" dur="3.78">polycentric governance of some kind and</text><text start="375.12" dur="3.359">then ownership that reflects their</text><text start="376.8" dur="2.88">contribution in it right so like the</text><text start="378.479" dur="4.081">thing I&apos;m thinking about in particular</text><text start="379.68" dur="6.48">is a you know I just came out of uh the</text><text start="382.56" dur="6.96">un&apos;s cop 27 the climate conference and</text><text start="386.16" dur="4.44">one of the things that stuck with me is</text><text start="389.52" dur="3.06">um we were at this little side event</text><text start="390.6" dur="4.439">called the world climate Summit it&apos;s the</text><text start="392.58" dur="4.26">world&apos;s biggest capital allocators in</text><text start="395.039" dur="2.88">public and private Partnerships and they</text><text start="396.84" dur="3.72">were one of the things that they said</text><text start="397.919" dur="5.28">during that was hey did you know that</text><text start="400.56" dur="5.04">roughly 80 of the world&apos;s biodiversity</text><text start="403.199" dur="4.5">is stewarded by a small amount of</text><text start="405.6" dur="4.439">indigenous people spread across the</text><text start="407.699" dur="4.741">world and did you also know that they</text><text start="410.039" dur="5.041">get paid next to nothing for this and</text><text start="412.44" dur="4.8">and all of that stewardship is basically</text><text start="415.08" dur="4.02">an input to the economy right it&apos;s the</text><text start="417.24" dur="3.72">this ecosystem services that people talk</text><text start="419.1" dur="4.2">about so going back to you kind of</text><text start="420.96" dur="3.9">you&apos;re like when you kind of remixed and</text><text start="423.3" dur="3.0">you know presented to me what I had said</text><text start="424.86" dur="2.7">I think the big missing piece too is</text><text start="426.3" dur="2.94">also making sure that people have</text><text start="427.56" dur="3.9">ownership and upside in all these</text><text start="429.24" dur="3.54">systems</text><text start="431.46" dur="3.179">right</text><text start="432.78" dur="5.58">so I mean I think that what would you</text><text start="434.639" dur="6.541">say I I think that there&apos;s a certain</text><text start="438.36" dur="3.959">bad taste in in people&apos;s mouth you know</text><text start="441.18" dur="3.0">particularly people who are</text><text start="442.319" dur="3.72">traditionally on the left when it comes</text><text start="444.18" dur="3.78">to taking markets and applying them in</text><text start="446.039" dur="3.66">these new vectors</text><text start="447.96" dur="3.48">um and and I&apos;m wondering if we could</text><text start="449.699" dur="3.241">talk about that a little bit because I</text><text start="451.44" dur="5.28">think there are some valid criticisms</text><text start="452.94" dur="6.18">there and we should unpack them anything</text><text start="456.72" dur="4.379">to say about that oh for sure I think</text><text start="459.12" dur="4.32">you know you and I did a panel</text><text start="461.099" dur="4.741">on this two I think at East Denver right</text><text start="463.44" dur="3.96">like you&apos;re in February and one of the</text><text start="465.84" dur="2.94">things I said there well it&apos;s like the</text><text start="467.4" dur="3.66">first thing actually is two things stick</text><text start="468.78" dur="5.699">out to me I think that</text><text start="471.06" dur="5.639">one you are going to like I would say in</text><text start="474.479" dur="4.681">some ways we already have like markets</text><text start="476.699" dur="4.981">and we have really bad markets and</text><text start="479.16" dur="4.8">things right like even think about like</text><text start="481.68" dur="5.239">um let&apos;s take even the sort of</text><text start="483.96" dur="5.28">indigenous people example right there&apos;s</text><text start="486.919" dur="4.72">across let&apos;s take South America and</text><text start="489.24" dur="5.22">places like Paraguay and and Brazil you</text><text start="491.639" dur="4.861">have um and you have various indigenous</text><text start="494.46" dur="4.919">people like the kayapo and other folks</text><text start="496.5" dur="6.419">who are stewarding uh basically forest</text><text start="499.379" dur="5.641">in those regions and you today can only</text><text start="502.919" dur="3.481">value those forests by what they are</text><text start="505.02" dur="3.899">worth when you cut them down and sell</text><text start="506.4" dur="4.739">them for Timber on a market right so I&apos;d</text><text start="508.919" dur="4.201">say the market are in that in their</text><text start="511.139" dur="3.9">instance for what those folks depend on</text><text start="513.12" dur="4.38">already exists and is existentially</text><text start="515.039" dur="5.161">threatening them right it would be great</text><text start="517.5" dur="6.0">to have another Market or another Market</text><text start="520.2" dur="4.92">Force that says actually the things that</text><text start="523.5" dur="3.72">these folks are doing living their lives</text><text start="525.12" dur="4.5">normally as they would anyway</text><text start="527.22" dur="5.16">Matt has another contribution that&apos;s</text><text start="529.62" dur="5.94">much much much much much bigger than you</text><text start="532.38" dur="6.12">know letting illegal loggers and um in</text><text start="535.56" dur="5.16">some cases paramilitary go out and steal</text><text start="538.5" dur="3.779">their land and kill them right so like</text><text start="540.72" dur="3.9">that&apos;s just one sort of toy example</text><text start="542.279" dur="4.201">right I&apos;d say like in some ways</text><text start="544.62" dur="4.08">the market forces have already happened</text><text start="546.48" dur="4.68">to them so it&apos;d be great if we could</text><text start="548.7" dur="5.04">find a way to include them and create</text><text start="551.16" dur="4.26">either opposing or orthogonal Market</text><text start="553.74" dur="4.26">forces that can offset some of that</text><text start="555.42" dur="4.74">stuff so I guess like the argument here</text><text start="558.0" dur="5.279">is that in the case of the loggers the</text><text start="560.16" dur="5.76">market forces have only made the forest</text><text start="563.279" dur="5.161">legible to the market wherein if they</text><text start="565.92" dur="4.859">cut it down and they sell it then that&apos;s</text><text start="568.44" dur="5.28">how them it&apos;s eligible to the market and</text><text start="570.779" dur="4.921">what if it was it what if there was a</text><text start="573.72" dur="4.02">sort of a stewardship stipend that was</text><text start="575.7" dur="5.34">given to people who were maintaining the</text><text start="577.74" dur="6.12">trees and maybe that was offset by some</text><text start="581.04" dur="5.52">sort of carbon credit system that</text><text start="583.86" dur="4.14">because the trees weren&apos;t being cut uh</text><text start="586.56" dur="4.08">chopped down that&apos;s where it gets funded</text><text start="588.0" dur="5.16">so basically making it legible to the</text><text start="590.64" dur="4.379">market in an opposing way to the</text><text start="593.16" dur="3.84">traditional extractive capitalist way is</text><text start="595.019" dur="4.5">what you&apos;re talking about here totally</text><text start="597.0" dur="4.32">and I think like carbon is just the</text><text start="599.519" dur="4.201">Tipping Point like or just the very tip</text><text start="601.32" dur="4.74">of it right because you could zoom out</text><text start="603.72" dur="3.84">and say uh this is the thing people have</text><text start="606.06" dur="3.54">been talking about for a couple decades</text><text start="607.56" dur="5.04">if not more what are what is the value</text><text start="609.6" dur="4.44">of ecosystem Services right so like what</text><text start="612.6" dur="4.08">is the value of carbon captured</text><text start="614.04" dur="5.04">oxygen-produced biodiversity supported</text><text start="616.68" dur="5.04">Watershed quality all that kind of stuff</text><text start="619.08" dur="4.08">right so I think when you you take that</text><text start="621.72" dur="3.239">you know today some of the numbers that</text><text start="623.16" dur="4.32">are thrown around by economists are</text><text start="624.959" dur="5.221">anywhere from 16 to 54 trillion dollars</text><text start="627.48" dur="5.64">is the worth of the inputs of nature</text><text start="630.18" dur="4.86">into the economy and so you know when</text><text start="633.12" dur="3.36">someone says like well markets have been</text><text start="635.04" dur="3.06">really traditionally really terrible I&apos;m</text><text start="636.48" dur="3.18">like yeah the problem a lot of the</text><text start="638.1" dur="4.26">problem with them is that they&apos;re</text><text start="639.66" dur="5.22">dominated by the interests of a few uh</text><text start="642.36" dur="4.26">there they become uh distorted by Price</text><text start="644.88" dur="3.6">making by Price making versus price</text><text start="646.62" dur="4.8">taking literally they just become</text><text start="648.48" dur="4.14">dysfunctional markets and then lastly a</text><text start="651.42" dur="2.76">bunch of people are just shut out from</text><text start="652.62" dur="3.959">you and participating in them right like</text><text start="654.18" dur="3.779">you have if I came today actually</text><text start="656.579" dur="3.0">thankfully there are a couple refi</text><text start="657.959" dur="3.481">projects are kind of working on this but</text><text start="659.579" dur="3.361">if you wanted to do that exact thing</text><text start="661.44" dur="5.04">that I said where someone said hey</text><text start="662.94" dur="5.16">actually I would like to not cut down</text><text start="666.48" dur="4.32">this forest and I would like to actually</text><text start="668.1" dur="4.859">make its value legible to you in other</text><text start="670.8" dur="4.68">ways and have that market value be</text><text start="672.959" dur="3.841">available such that someone can say oh I</text><text start="675.48" dur="3.78">would like to purchase the ecosystem</text><text start="676.8" dur="5.34">Services of this region and not cut down</text><text start="679.26" dur="4.92">the trees that would actually be I think</text><text start="682.14" dur="3.24">game changing right at least from my</text><text start="684.18" dur="4.08">perspective</text><text start="685.38" dur="4.74">yeah one of the things I I run into</text><text start="688.26" dur="5.94">sometimes when we&apos;re I&apos;m talking about</text><text start="690.12" dur="6.12">this uh which I&apos;m doing a lot uh is is</text><text start="694.2" dur="3.6">where&apos;s the money gonna come from that</text><text start="696.24" dur="5.46">sort of creates that opposing Market</text><text start="697.8" dur="5.58">Force to the loggers and and I didn&apos;t</text><text start="701.7" dur="3.12">know the answer for a little while but</text><text start="703.38" dur="3.899">then Griff green started talking about</text><text start="704.82" dur="4.74">how there&apos;s like</text><text start="707.279" dur="4.381">tens of trillions of dollars of money</text><text start="709.56" dur="4.74">going into public goods if you count all</text><text start="711.66" dur="4.679">of the existing Charities uh and local</text><text start="714.3" dur="4.2">government and</text><text start="716.339" dur="4.381">um State and national government in the</text><text start="718.5" dur="4.74">United States and and sort of like one</text><text start="720.72" dur="3.78">of his ideas is that the money that</text><text start="723.24" dur="2.88">would have gone into some like</text><text start="724.5" dur="4.26">hierarchical high administrative</text><text start="726.12" dur="3.779">overhead program to regenerate the world</text><text start="728.76" dur="2.88">coming from the state or I guess</text><text start="729.899" dur="4.5">regenerate your local economy since</text><text start="731.64" dur="6.0">states have local jurisdictions could</text><text start="734.399" dur="4.741">then be channeled into these kinds of</text><text start="737.64" dur="4.08">stipends and they can just be more</text><text start="739.14" dur="4.74">efficient because they&apos;re being deployed</text><text start="741.72" dur="4.2">through a network based system and smart</text><text start="743.88" dur="4.079">contracts and stuff like that so so I</text><text start="745.92" dur="4.32">guess like two-part question what do you</text><text start="747.959" dur="5.101">think of the question of how do we fund</text><text start="750.24" dur="4.8">this world regeneration</text><text start="753.06" dur="3.24">um what do you think of that and and</text><text start="755.04" dur="3.239">also you know what do you think of</text><text start="756.3" dur="3.84">Griff&apos;s thesis about that trillions of</text><text start="758.279" dur="4.081">dollars that was going to the state now</text><text start="760.14" dur="4.199">being channeled through smart contracts</text><text start="762.36" dur="4.32">oh well I have talked to Griff about</text><text start="764.339" dur="4.321">this quite a lot actually on the uh and</text><text start="766.68" dur="3.599">I&apos;ll take that part of it first I think</text><text start="768.66" dur="3.06">that</text><text start="770.279" dur="3.901">um you know when you think about all the</text><text start="771.72" dur="4.559">folks involved in this it is and truly</text><text start="774.18" dur="3.42">is like it&apos;s it&apos;s just a mess right like</text><text start="776.279" dur="3.12">when you think you have to zoom into</text><text start="777.6" dur="2.82">like what level of the ontology you&apos;re</text><text start="779.399" dur="3.841">talking about with respect to</text><text start="780.42" dur="4.68">jurisdictions and states right like</text><text start="783.24" dur="4.68">um and at every level it gets more</text><text start="785.1" dur="4.979">convoluted but at in theory I actually</text><text start="787.92" dur="4.56">do agree with that like that is public</text><text start="790.079" dur="3.901">good spending right the problem much</text><text start="792.48" dur="3.06">like you know you&apos;ve probably done a</text><text start="793.98" dur="4.859">couple episodes on decentralized science</text><text start="795.54" dur="5.96">right the problem yeah I see the problem</text><text start="798.839" dur="5.701">is similar to science in that you have</text><text start="801.5" dur="5.079">the production of you know an</text><text start="804.54" dur="4.08">epistemology facts a bunch of things</text><text start="806.579" dur="5.181">scientific facts being you know put out</text><text start="808.62" dur="6.18">there that is also entangled with</text><text start="811.76" dur="5.56">reputation uh Prestige career</text><text start="814.8" dur="4.26">advancement all these other things right</text><text start="817.32" dur="3.36">um because of the bureaucratization of</text><text start="819.06" dur="4.079">Science and that&apos;s not to say it&apos;s good</text><text start="820.68" dur="4.68">or bad it&apos;s just a fact right so then</text><text start="823.139" dur="4.981">take that and say maybe look at your</text><text start="825.36" dur="5.88">local jurisdiction the thesis for Griff</text><text start="828.12" dur="5.1">here is that a lot of the funding and a</text><text start="831.24" dur="3.42">lot of the projects are actually tied in</text><text start="833.22" dur="3.059">these hierarchical structures to things</text><text start="834.66" dur="4.2">other than their outcomes right they&apos;re</text><text start="836.279" dur="4.021">tied to things like uh this person gets</text><text start="838.86" dur="3.419">a promotion for getting it through the</text><text start="840.3" dur="3.599">other person on the other side might you</text><text start="842.279" dur="3.781">know back scratch the private sector</text><text start="843.899" dur="3.721">employee to come in and run the thing on</text><text start="846.06" dur="3.779">the public side in the next go around</text><text start="847.62" dur="5.279">and all this right I think that&apos;s the</text><text start="849.839" dur="4.74">real promise of if Griff&apos;s thing leads</text><text start="852.899" dur="4.44">anywhere that&apos;s the real promise of it</text><text start="854.579" dur="4.681">right is that it disentangles uh these</text><text start="857.339" dur="4.381">status hierarchies that actually prevent</text><text start="859.26" dur="5.0">us from making what we what people would</text><text start="861.72" dur="6.359">ostensibly say are objectively better</text><text start="864.26" dur="6.4">impact-based outcomes right so I&apos;d say I</text><text start="868.079" dur="4.141">mostly agree and if I&apos;m curious I&apos;m</text><text start="870.66" dur="4.08">really curious to see if that plays out</text><text start="872.22" dur="5.28">right if you can actually say let&apos;s make</text><text start="874.74" dur="4.92">a you know a local city Dao or a</text><text start="877.5" dur="3.899">neighborhood Dao even that says hey</text><text start="879.66" dur="3.96">we&apos;re gonna we&apos;re actually going to take</text><text start="881.399" dur="3.541">the local actors as being the experts on</text><text start="883.62" dur="3.12">what needs to happen here and we&apos;re</text><text start="884.94" dur="3.54">going to let them maybe use something</text><text start="886.74" dur="3.719">like bitcoin&apos;s quadratic funding</text><text start="888.48" dur="4.32">Primitives to decide what needs to get</text><text start="890.459" dur="5.281">out there for them right</text><text start="892.8" dur="4.8">and now that is a super cool experiment</text><text start="895.74" dur="3.539">now the only thing the only problem it</text><text start="897.6" dur="3.0">runs into is how do you bootstrap that</text><text start="899.279" dur="5.581">system and how do you make it like</text><text start="900.6" dur="6.359">either you know City State Global right</text><text start="904.86" dur="5.4">that&apos;s the hard part</text><text start="906.959" dur="4.981">yeah yeah I mean for me each of these</text><text start="910.26" dur="4.8">mechanisms you need a mechanism to</text><text start="911.94" dur="5.519">distribute capital and then according to</text><text start="915.06" dur="5.7">who&apos;s doing the most public good</text><text start="917.459" dur="5.161">um or regenerative work you know I&apos;m I</text><text start="920.76" dur="3.3">think public goods are a horizon they&apos;re</text><text start="922.62" dur="2.82">they&apos;re a little bit technocratic</text><text start="924.06" dur="2.7">because you know as soon as you start</text><text start="925.44" dur="3.839">giving out something that&apos;s excludable</text><text start="926.76" dur="3.84">or rivalrous in some Dimension then</text><text start="929.279" dur="2.941">um but anyway you need a mechanism that</text><text start="930.6" dur="3.0">gives out the the money to people who</text><text start="932.22" dur="3.66">are doing good and then you need a</text><text start="933.6" dur="3.599">mechanism for raising the money and I</text><text start="935.88" dur="2.579">think it&apos;s easier for people to grok</text><text start="937.199" dur="2.76">that oh some of this money that was</text><text start="938.459" dur="2.88">coming in through taxes which was</text><text start="939.959" dur="3.24">designated for the public good could be</text><text start="941.339" dur="3.601">used to fund these dials but there are</text><text start="943.199" dur="4.26">more advanced mechanisms of raising that</text><text start="944.94" dur="4.92">money like you could create a dow for</text><text start="947.459" dur="4.56">that local neighborhood and create a</text><text start="949.86" dur="4.26">local currency for that of which you</text><text start="952.019" dur="3.481">know most of the treasury goes to but</text><text start="954.12" dur="3.6">then you get into all these problems of</text><text start="955.5" dur="4.92">bootstrapping a new local currency and</text><text start="957.72" dur="4.26">why is that worth anything and and you</text><text start="960.42" dur="2.76">know it&apos;s just simpler to say oh we&apos;re</text><text start="961.98" dur="3.599">going to take some of the taxpayer money</text><text start="963.18" dur="3.36">to to bootstrap it but I actually think</text><text start="965.579" dur="3.181">it&apos;s really interesting to think about</text><text start="966.54" dur="4.859">the mech mechanism Legos on the</text><text start="968.76" dur="4.86">distribution side and then the the the</text><text start="971.399" dur="4.861">plurality of ways that you could raise</text><text start="973.62" dur="4.26">money to go into the Legos and then like</text><text start="976.26" dur="3.54">eventually through all the permutations</text><text start="977.88" dur="3.6">will eventually find something that</text><text start="979.8" dur="3.899">works and then starts to work at scale</text><text start="981.48" dur="4.219">with these things absolutely and I think</text><text start="983.699" dur="5.64">for me the real interesting question is</text><text start="985.699" dur="6.76">can an investor of any kind whether it</text><text start="989.339" dur="4.74">be a venture a debt or even just patient</text><text start="992.459" dur="4.201">Capital which is kind of becoming a</text><text start="994.079" dur="4.44">popular term these days can a person</text><text start="996.66" dur="3.539">like that come in and bootstrap these</text><text start="998.519" dur="3.481">systems can a group like that come in</text><text start="1000.199" dur="4.801">and say hey this is a super interesting</text><text start="1002.0" dur="5.579">outcome the potential Market is in the</text><text start="1005.0" dur="6.12">trillions and we actually care less</text><text start="1007.579" dur="6.241">about having like 12 of it at IPO the</text><text start="1011.12" dur="4.8">notion of IPO doesn&apos;t exist here it&apos;s</text><text start="1013.82" dur="3.6">actually just more of a network play and</text><text start="1015.92" dur="4.02">we could take one percent of it and</text><text start="1017.42" dur="4.859">create massive massive economic benefits</text><text start="1019.94" dur="5.22">for everyone right that&apos;s really a big</text><text start="1022.279" dur="5.101">part of my you know experiment in this</text><text start="1025.16" dur="6.0">whole regenerative economy thing is is</text><text start="1027.38" dur="5.579">that possible I don&apos;t know yet well do</text><text start="1031.16" dur="4.74">you know any investors we could ask how</text><text start="1032.959" dur="4.5">do we make regen stuff investable oh</text><text start="1035.9" dur="3.059">well actually it&apos;s funny you say that</text><text start="1037.459" dur="5.761">that&apos;s literally what I think about and</text><text start="1038.959" dur="7.141">all in my free time I&apos;d say maybe it&apos;s</text><text start="1043.22" dur="4.56">Gotta Be maybe at least 50 of my deal</text><text start="1046.1" dur="3.48">calls are just trying to figure out with</text><text start="1047.78" dur="4.139">an entrepreneur or the founder like hey</text><text start="1049.58" dur="4.56">uh how can we shape this into a thing</text><text start="1051.919" dur="4.681">that offers some clear value to</text><text start="1054.14" dur="4.5">investors but also Isn&apos;t So hideous that</text><text start="1056.6" dur="4.02">it just you know takes over your whole</text><text start="1058.64" dur="4.02">network and makes it the BC chain right</text><text start="1060.62" dur="5.16">because nobody wants that I don&apos;t want</text><text start="1062.66" dur="4.379">that all right like but how do you make</text><text start="1065.78" dur="2.639">things I mean really it&apos;s a great</text><text start="1067.039" dur="3.541">question because</text><text start="1068.419" dur="4.081">I I think this is fresh on my mind too</text><text start="1070.58" dur="3.959">coming out of cop because like I said</text><text start="1072.5" dur="3.539">you have all these huge huge Capital</text><text start="1074.539" dur="3.0">allocators who are sitting here going</text><text start="1076.039" dur="3.481">like I&apos;m talking just to be clear right</text><text start="1077.539" dur="4.02">like you know</text><text start="1079.52" dur="4.14">um Schroeders which is one of the uh the</text><text start="1081.559" dur="4.381">UK&apos;s biggest asset managers 700 billion</text><text start="1083.66" dur="4.8">under management you have like</text><text start="1085.94" dur="5.28">um Cafe Holdings which is a near a</text><text start="1088.46" dur="4.98">trillion in management you have uh LGT</text><text start="1091.22" dur="4.44">who is the world&apos;s biggest family office</text><text start="1093.44" dur="3.42">sitting on like 5 billion</text><text start="1095.66" dur="3.0">um and these people are coming together</text><text start="1096.86" dur="4.02">and saying hey</text><text start="1098.66" dur="3.66">um we&apos;ve realized that we&apos;ve learned</text><text start="1100.88" dur="3.179">some interesting things about impact</text><text start="1102.32" dur="3.84">specifically about climate in the last</text><text start="1104.059" dur="3.601">20 years but all of the things we&apos;ve</text><text start="1106.16" dur="3.24">kind of done are just little you know</text><text start="1107.66" dur="3.24">like dinking and Duncan here and there</text><text start="1109.4" dur="3.48">they&apos;re not tied together like in a</text><text start="1110.9" dur="3.6">cohesive Vision there&apos;s no there&apos;s no</text><text start="1112.88" dur="5.4">technology behind it that can really</text><text start="1114.5" dur="7.74">help scale it up right and so I think</text><text start="1118.28" dur="5.519">making regen stuff investable you some</text><text start="1122.24" dur="4.02">of it has to do with you know Kevin</text><text start="1123.799" dur="4.561">you&apos;re a you&apos;re a multi-time Founder</text><text start="1126.26" dur="3.539">right they have all these things in</text><text start="1128.36" dur="3.54">Silicon Valley and such around customer</text><text start="1129.799" dur="4.441">development understanding the various</text><text start="1131.9" dur="4.08">folks in your uh you know your customer</text><text start="1134.24" dur="3.36">segmentation understanding the various</text><text start="1135.98" dur="3.6">parties involved in your network I think</text><text start="1137.6" dur="3.72">some of that stuff applies almost one to</text><text start="1139.58" dur="4.5">one to what we&apos;re building here but some</text><text start="1141.32" dur="5.28">of it doesn&apos;t right and so like making</text><text start="1144.08" dur="4.62">regen stuff investable the first thing I</text><text start="1146.6" dur="4.74">always ask is like one why does this</text><text start="1148.7" dur="4.14">have to be a blockchain right like this</text><text start="1151.34" dur="3.24">is because a lot of the stuff we talk</text><text start="1152.84" dur="4.5">about even I think you did an episode on</text><text start="1154.58" dur="4.86">carbon credits right like a lot of the</text><text start="1157.34" dur="5.16">stuff around carbon credits even it&apos;s</text><text start="1159.44" dur="4.619">unclear to the market players why it has</text><text start="1162.5" dur="4.08">to be on a blockchain right because you</text><text start="1164.059" dur="4.441">can do a lot of it with a database</text><text start="1166.58" dur="3.36">um so I think really number one there is</text><text start="1168.5" dur="3.059">like why does it have to be a blockchain</text><text start="1169.94" dur="3.42">and there has to be a really compelling</text><text start="1171.559" dur="3.301">reason for that and there are compelling</text><text start="1173.36" dur="3.6">reasons for it right like you want to</text><text start="1174.86" dur="5.28">make something that&apos;s difficult to make</text><text start="1176.96" dur="5.04">legible legible to two computers in a</text><text start="1180.14"

dur="3.54">think I I sort of playfully asked that</text><text start="1277.28" dur="4.2">question about how do we make regen web</text><text start="1278.66" dur="4.379">3 investable but uh you&apos;re actually a</text><text start="1281.48" dur="3.6">professional investor working on this so</text><text start="1283.039" dur="4.561">like you know what&apos;s your what&apos;s your</text><text

what</text><text start="1292.1" dur="3.059">kind of Trends you&apos;re seeing as someone</text><text start="1293.24" dur="5.1">who&apos;s been a capital allocator in this</text><text start="1295.159" dur="6.121">space yeah for sure so I think like</text><text start="1298.34" dur="4.319">the thesis I you can maybe even obsessed</text><text start="1301.28" dur="4.08">out from a couple other answers but</text><text start="1302.659" dur="3.9">really I just think that we need you</text><text start="1305.36" dur="2.34">know you and I think we kind of agree on</text><text start="1306.559" dur="2.341">this is that we need to build a</text><text start="1307.7" dur="2.58">regenerative economy and we need to</text><text start="1308.9" dur="3.18">build it because our lives dependent</text><text start="1310.28" dur="3.779">depend on it on in this Century</text><text start="1312.08" dur="3.599">basically our lives and our children&apos;s</text><text start="1314.059" dur="4.081">lives right</text><text start="1315.679" dur="5.161">um and uh what does that entail I think</text><text start="1318.14" dur="4.86">it entails basically you know</text><text start="1320.84" dur="5.459">when we we touched on this a little bit</text><text start="1323.0" dur="5.22">with Griff but uh how do we get the</text><text start="1326.299" dur="5.221">attention of the biggest Capital</text><text start="1328.22" dur="5.64">allocators just in the world period to</text><text start="1331.52" dur="4.019">realize that they all realize they need</text><text start="1333.86" dur="4.26">to build a new economy but they don&apos;t</text><text start="1335.539" dur="5.221">know necessarily where to do that and</text><text start="1338.12" dur="4.2">how to do it and so for us one of the</text><text start="1340.76" dur="2.399">big things we look at basically three</text><text start="1342.32" dur="3.239">things</text><text start="1343.159" dur="5.461">how do we make blockchains in</text><text start="1345.559" dur="4.62">interacting with them easier safer more</text><text start="1348.62" dur="4.38">secure so we look at a lot of stuff</text><text start="1350.179" dur="5.461">around user experience uh smart contract</text><text start="1353.0" dur="5.22">wallets uh decentralized custody stuff</text><text start="1355.64" dur="4.44">like this because we deeply believe in</text><text start="1358.22" dur="3.48">you know what actually is happening</text><text start="1360.08" dur="4.02">under the scenes but we need to make</text><text start="1361.7" dur="4.14">sure that dude if if you have like</text><text start="1364.1" dur="3.12">Deloitte or someone in here coming in to</text><text start="1365.84" dur="3.18">meet their Net Zero commitments on</text><text start="1367.22" dur="3.839">Toucan they&apos;re not going to use a wallet</text><text start="1369.02" dur="4.019">right like we and if they are going to</text><text start="1371.059" dur="3.36">use a wallet their CFO is going to have</text><text start="1373.039" dur="2.88">a conniption that&apos;s got to have access</text><text start="1374.419" dur="3.24">control permissions and a bunch of</text><text start="1375.919" dur="3.841">security features right that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1377.659" dur="3.9">mean that we need to obscure or not</text><text start="1379.76" dur="3.36">build it on blockchain it means that we</text><text start="1381.559" dur="3.541">need to actually figure out maybe with</text><text start="1383.12" dur="4.26">multi-party computation or other fancy</text><text start="1385.1" dur="4.68">things how to make that viable for them</text><text start="1387.38" dur="4.62">right and so we look at stuff like that</text><text start="1389.78" dur="5.16">the next step really for us is that</text><text start="1392.0" dur="4.74">there are there exists right now in</text><text start="1394.94" dur="3.0">these natural asset markets like carbon</text><text start="1396.74" dur="4.98">and other things</text><text start="1397.94" dur="5.82">there&apos;s no real way to help Capital make</text><text start="1401.72" dur="3.18">a return on its risk right so what I</text><text start="1403.76" dur="3.899">mean by that is</text><text start="1404.9" dur="5.759">you go to any of these account managers</text><text start="1407.659" dur="5.101">or ESG managers sustainability managers</text><text start="1410.659" dur="3.841">and you say hey what&apos;s your carbon</text><text start="1412.76" dur="3.6">strategy what&apos;s your Net Zero strategy</text><text start="1414.5" dur="4.02">and they&apos;ll be like great I just you</text><text start="1416.36" dur="4.439">know I basically just have to buy the</text><text start="1418.52" dur="3.36">stuff that&apos;s a huge cost center on my</text><text start="1420.799" dur="3.541">balance sheet at the end of the day</text><text start="1421.88" dur="4.26">because you know either the government</text><text start="1424.34" dur="3.78">said so or we did it because of the</text><text start="1426.14" dur="3.659">voluntary carbon markets and you know</text><text start="1428.12" dur="4.02">other being pulled into it by NetZero</text><text start="1429.799" dur="4.201">pledges it would be really great and</text><text start="1432.14" dur="4.38">it&apos;s a thesis area for us if you could</text><text start="1434.0" dur="5.4">make investing in</text><text start="1436.52" dur="5.279">in the refi economy something where you</text><text start="1439.4" dur="3.96">might actually get a return so like you</text><text start="1441.799" dur="3.601">look around at even the Commodities</text><text start="1443.36" dur="3.9">markets for carbon it&apos;s really hard for</text><text start="1445.4" dur="3.6">you to get into things like uh Chicago</text><text start="1447.26" dur="3.419">merchantel Exchange there&apos;s three</text><text start="1449.0" dur="4.2">different types of carbon Futures right</text><text start="1450.679" dur="4.021">there aren&apos;t perps there aren&apos;t options</text><text start="1453.2" dur="3.719">there&apos;s no way for you to hedge really</text><text start="1454.7" dur="4.26">on your positions and I&apos;m talking about</text><text start="1456.919" dur="4.081">in the normal world right not in crypto</text><text start="1458.96" dur="4.98">world and we know this stuff pretty well</text><text start="1461.0" dur="6.059">even with the FTX collapse like crypto</text><text start="1463.94" dur="4.979">drives a ton of volume in perps right so</text><text start="1467.059" dur="3.12">we look at stuff like that and say how</text><text start="1468.919" dur="2.401">can we look at this through the lens of</text><text start="1470.179" dur="3.0">a person who&apos;s trying to allocate</text><text start="1471.32" dur="3.719">Capital to this asset class</text><text start="1473.179" dur="4.321">if they own a bunch of nature-based</text><text start="1475.039" dur="4.561">solutions how can they actually say</text><text start="1477.5" dur="4.559">how can they treat it as risk capital</text><text start="1479.6" dur="3.72">and not just a cost center on their on</text><text start="1482.059" dur="3.061">their balance sheet that involves</text><text start="1483.32" dur="3.78">building new D5 Primitives with</text><text start="1485.12" dur="3.48">decentralized custody and the trust that</text><text start="1487.1" dur="3.66">you need for Enterprises to engage in</text><text start="1488.6" dur="3.48">this market and so we are very</text><text start="1490.76" dur="2.48">interested in folks who are building</text><text start="1492.08" dur="3.479">cross-chain</text><text start="1493.24" dur="5.559">cross-chain perps cross chain options</text><text start="1495.559" dur="5.401">cross chain refi assets basically so we</text><text start="1498.799" dur="4.441">look at a lot of that stuff and then</text><text start="1500.96" dur="3.599">lastly we&apos;re just looking at what I&apos;d</text><text start="1503.24" dur="3.48">call the actual refi Solutions</text><text start="1504.559" dur="4.081">themselves right so we work really</text><text start="1506.72" dur="3.48">closely with regen Network who&apos;s uh</text><text start="1508.64" dur="5.279">basically the community owned registry</text><text start="1510.2" dur="5.16">for Eco asset issuance and we you know</text><text start="1513.919" dur="3.0">we&apos;ve touched on a lot of stuff this</text><text start="1515.36" dur="2.88">year we&apos;ve made like 16 investments in</text><text start="1516.919" dur="4.5">refi this year</text><text start="1518.24" dur="5.4">um actually sorry we made about 10 16 we</text><text start="1521.419" dur="4.561">made 16 10 of those a refi we would call</text><text start="1523.64" dur="4.56">we put in that refi bucket and for us</text><text start="1525.98" dur="4.079">it&apos;s very much just saying how can we</text><text start="1528.2" dur="4.14">begin to build on that vision of like</text><text start="1530.059" dur="4.261">more people more liquidity and price</text><text start="1532.34" dur="3.18">Discovery and more actual regenerative</text><text start="1534.32" dur="3.18">Solutions</text><text start="1535.52" dur="4.68">right yeah it just feels like there&apos;s</text><text start="1537.5" dur="5.58">this Loop where if we can get</text><text start="1540.2" dur="5.28">if we can get like a regen Market</text><text start="1543.08" dur="4.92">category leader it can kind of create</text><text start="1545.48" dur="4.74">this gravity well that pulls in more</text><text start="1548.0" dur="3.9">attention and talent and capital and</text><text start="1550.22" dur="3.839">then if you go up the food chain from</text><text start="1551.9" dur="4.379">like talent and capital to like Dows</text><text start="1554.059" dur="4.081">that are successful and then you get to</text><text start="1556.279" dur="3.78">like funds that are having good returns</text><text start="1558.14" dur="3.659">through regen then there&apos;s like this</text><text start="1560.059" dur="3.301">copycat effect where like you see one</text><text start="1561.799" dur="3.12">that&apos;s success one dial that&apos;s</text><text start="1563.36" dur="2.819">successful and then 100 other dials</text><text start="1564.919" dur="2.88">launched you know we saw it with ohm we</text><text start="1566.179" dur="3.301">saw it with yams</text><text start="1567.799" dur="4.321">um and and there&apos;s like the same effect</text><text start="1569.48" dur="4.559">with funds where if if Cerulean could</text><text start="1572.12" dur="4.26">generate outsides returns by investing</text><text start="1574.039" dur="3.421">in regen web 3 then that creates this</text><text start="1576.38" dur="2.64">domino effect where all these other</text><text start="1577.46" dur="3.66">funds are just going to follow into it</text><text start="1579.02" dur="3.96">and so for me it feels like the highest</text><text start="1581.12" dur="3.659">thing that we can do is create a market</text><text start="1582.98" dur="5.64">success</text><text start="1584.779" dur="5.4">um in returns in in in this category and</text><text start="1588.62" dur="2.88">and that&apos;ll just create this gravity</text><text start="1590.179" dur="3.841">wall that pulls more and more people</text><text start="1591.5" dur="4.559">into regen now it&apos;s there&apos;s a little bit</text><text start="1594.02" dur="4.019">of like a draw the rest of the owl here</text><text start="1596.059" dur="3.421">because how do you create a giant market</text><text start="1598.039" dur="5.101">success when you&apos;re working with public</text><text start="1599.48" dur="6.179">goods in and you&apos;re competing against</text><text start="1603.14" dur="4.2">um projects that are you know that are</text><text start="1605.659" dur="3.421">extracting in order to create higher</text><text start="1607.34" dur="4.02">returns so I think that there&apos;s a little</text><text start="1609.08" dur="4.199">bit of like an uphill climb to do it but</text><text start="1611.36" dur="4.439">that&apos;s that&apos;s at least how I think about</text><text start="1613.279" dur="4.321">this movement growing bigger</text><text start="1615.799" dur="3.661">I think you&apos;re spot on Kevin because the</text><text start="1617.6" dur="4.26">thing I I had this little you know</text><text start="1619.46" dur="3.959">almost aside in that last bit talking</text><text start="1621.86" dur="3.059">about the thesis where I was like oh</text><text start="1623.419" dur="2.941">yeah in region the community the</text><text start="1624.919" dur="3.541">community owned registry it&apos;s like well</text><text start="1626.36" dur="3.179">it&apos;s a big part of our strategy just</text><text start="1628.46" dur="3.06">because</text><text start="1629.539" dur="3.721">um we think like look you can go out</text><text start="1631.52" dur="3.12">there and sort of Dink and dunk with</text><text start="1633.26" dur="3.899">your five million 10 million dollar</text><text start="1634.64" dur="4.32">rounds here when you have your interoper</text><text start="1637.159" dur="4.26">if you know you can make up you know pie</text><text start="1638.96" dur="4.92">into interoperability and cooperation</text><text start="1641.419" dur="4.161">but you really have to ensure that if</text><text start="1643.88" dur="5.279">there is a natural asset issuance</text><text start="1645.58" dur="5.86">happening in the web 3 economy that it</text><text start="1649.159" dur="4.38">is going through like you know Dallas</text><text start="1651.44" dur="3.78">have governed how it&apos;s issued those</text><text start="1653.539" dur="3.481">Downs are composed of people who are</text><text start="1655.22" dur="3.839">scientists land stewards people who</text><text start="1657.02" dur="4.86">actually understand what&apos;s happening</text><text start="1659.059" dur="6.12">um with this asset and that it isn&apos;t</text><text start="1661.88" dur="5.46">just you know cornered by one VC chain</text><text start="1665.179" dur="3.961">only that owns all the upside in it and</text><text start="1667.34" dur="3.719">then it&apos;s just going to you know then</text><text start="1669.14" dur="3.659">they&apos;ll dump on retail that&apos;s I don&apos;t</text><text start="1671.059" dur="3.901">think that&apos;s an outcome anyone wants</text><text start="1672.799" dur="3.061">basically all right we have to find a</text><text start="1674.96" dur="3.02">way to</text><text start="1675.86" dur="3.96">in my opinion I think we have to have</text><text start="1677.98" dur="3.46">polycentric governance for all of these</text><text start="1679.82" dur="3.3">things we have to make sure that most</text><text start="1681.44"

credit</text><text start="1686.72" dur="5.16">issuance have bags in each other and so</text><text start="1689.9" dur="3.96">that so that we all have pieces of each</text><text start="1691.88" dur="3.539">other and are not just uh well well it</text><text start="1693.86" dur="3.059">seems like they&apos;ve aggregated all the</text><text start="1695.419" dur="2.821">demand and they&apos;ve aggravated all the</text><text start="1696.919" dur="2.821">supply we should just go with those two</text><text start="1698.24" dur="3.96">and then we have another Monopoly</text><text start="1699.74"

dur="2.819">thing that really caught our attention</text><text start="1890.419" dur="4.38">was that their Founders All gave</text><text start="1891.919" dur="5.221">themselves 10-year best right and so</text><text start="1894.799" dur="3.541">like that&apos;s an easy deal where we</text><text start="1897.14" dur="3.539">actually we&apos;re trying to get a lot of</text><text start="1898.34" dur="4.26">our other group a lot of our other folks</text><text start="1900.679" dur="3.541">to actually look at this and say like we</text><text start="1902.6" dur="4.679">will take this with you

very</text><text start="1921.679" dur="6.541">much making sure that your Founders and</text><text start="1924.679" dur="5.041">their teams are adequately capitalized</text><text start="1928.22"

the</text><text start="1950.779" dur="4.741">audience of some of these numbers</text><text start="1952.46" dur="5.339">a 20 to 54 trillion dollar natural asset</text><text start="1955.52" dur="4.98">economy that&apos;s basically unaccounted for</text><text start="1957.799" dur="5.161">for the most part carbon accounts for</text><text start="1960.5" dur="5.1">two billion of it and there&apos;s a maybe a</text><text start="1962.96" dur="5.699">little bit more of it tied up in</text><text start="1965.6" dur="5.28">um in Ocean and offsets around that but</text><text start="1968.659" dur="4.801">not much right so if we are patient with</text><text start="1970.88" dur="3.539">this we can all we can all win pretty</text><text start="1973.46" dur="2.699">much</text><text start="1974.419" dur="3.841">what what can you tell me where that</text><text start="1976.159" dur="3.841">trillion dollar number comes from</text><text start="1978.26" dur="3.899">because I hear you know I got one I got</text><text start="1980.0" dur="4.38">Griff on one on one shoulder talking</text><text start="1982.159" dur="4.26">about this 10 trillion dollars of public</text><text start="1984.38" dur="4.14">goods if you add up all the spending</text><text start="1986.419" dur="4.14">yearly from from local governments but</text><text start="1988.52" dur="4.44">that sounds like a different number uh</text><text start="1990.559" dur="4.141">of the market size of regen web3 yeah</text><text start="1992.96" dur="3.0">absolutely I&apos;ll I&apos;ll send that maybe if</text><text start="1994.7" dur="2.94">you have show Notes too you can stick it</text><text start="1995.96" dur="3.559">in there but there&apos;s this paper in the</text><text start="1997.64" dur="5.46">Nate that&apos;s published in nature like in</text><text start="1999.519" dur="5.321">1997 or so it&apos;s called Uh the value of</text><text start="2003.1" dur="3.9">the world&apos;s ecosystem services and</text><text start="2004.84" dur="3.42">natural Capital assets and they</text><text start="2007.0" dur="4.44">basically go through this framework</text><text start="2008.26" dur="5.759">where they try to look at the oceans the</text><text start="2011.44" dur="5.82">forest soil</text><text start="2014.019" dur="5.4">um air quality and try to price uh like</text><text start="2017.26" dur="5.639">like the economists they are</text><text start="2019.419" dur="6.181">um what what is the impact from you know</text><text start="2022.899" dur="4.201">air quality let&apos;s take air quality right</text><text start="2025.6" dur="3.48">um air quality is a really difficult one</text><text start="2027.1" dur="3.959">to price so they actually take the</text><text start="2029.08" dur="3.9">opposite view of it and say what is the</text><text start="2031.059" dur="3.48">impact of negative air quality in terms</text><text start="2032.98" dur="4.02">of deaths per year and then what is the</text><text start="2034.539" dur="4.62">price of a human life right and they</text><text start="2037.0" dur="5.34">basically come up with something like</text><text start="2039.159" dur="4.681">of negative air quality takes two</text><text start="2042.34" dur="3.12">trillion dollars away from the global</text><text start="2043.84" dur="4.14">from the global economy every year</text><text start="2045.46" dur="4.98">because of you know early deaths</text><text start="2047.98" dur="5.399">childhood deaths uh lung diseases all</text><text start="2050.44" dur="4.679">that kind of stuff right so then they&apos;ll</text><text start="2053.379" dur="3.78">move on to stuff like forests and they</text><text start="2055.119" dur="3.78">say great what is the economic value of</text><text start="2057.159" dur="4.02">a forest well if we price it straight up</text><text start="2058.899" dur="6.0">on Timber only this is the number we get</text><text start="2061.179" dur="7.081">at now let&apos;s try to include in that as</text><text start="2064.899" dur="4.561">well uh let&apos;s try to tie what if so then</text><text start="2068.26" dur="3.78">they kind of walk through some scenarios</text><text start="2069.46" dur="4.98">here and they say well forests produce x</text><text start="2072.04" dur="5.04">amount of oxygen they also capture</text><text start="2074.44" dur="4.14">particulates so the stuff that is</text><text start="2077.08" dur="3.48">actually coming into the other side for</text><text start="2078.58" dur="3.24">the air quality argument is kind of</text><text start="2080.56" dur="3.42">coming in on this side with the</text><text start="2081.82" dur="3.839">particulate matter capture that the</text><text start="2083.98" dur="3.72">forests and other things do of course</text><text start="2085.659" dur="3.541">and you know trees and all that so</text><text start="2087.7" dur="3.78">through this framework you know I&apos;m like</text><text start="2089.2" dur="3.6">summarizing a huge paper but that&apos;s</text><text start="2091.48" dur="4.32">essentially a good kind of thing they</text><text start="2092.8" dur="5.819">walk through and say great Boris 2x the</text><text start="2095.8" dur="6.6">oceans do y let&apos;s then also look at you</text><text start="2098.619" dur="5.701">know Fishery the sea shellfish all the</text><text start="2102.4" dur="4.08">value that comes that feeds people out</text><text start="2104.32" dur="4.14">of the ocean let&apos;s also try to look at</text><text start="2106.48" dur="3.9">the value of carbon credits and how much</text><text start="2108.46" dur="4.139">carbon the ocean captures it&apos;s a</text><text start="2110.38" dur="3.6">substantial amount something like a I</text><text start="2112.599" dur="3.721">don&apos;t remember if I&apos;m making this up so</text><text start="2113.98" dur="4.98">maybe they&apos;ll call on me in the</text><text start="2116.32" dur="5.16">in the comments but it&apos;s something like</text><text start="2118.96" dur="4.86">70 to 80 percent of all of the carbon on</text><text start="2121.48" dur="4.619">Earth is captured by the ocean right so</text><text start="2123.82" dur="3.36">uh that&apos;s a substantial amount that</text><text start="2126.099" dur="2.52">we&apos;re just walking around going like</text><text start="2127.18" dur="4.5">isn&apos;t it great the ocean does that most</text><text start="2128.619" dur="4.201">of us have no idea right and so</text><text start="2131.68" dur="2.34">um that&apos;s kind of where these numbers</text><text start="2132.82" dur="4.019">come from</text><text start="2134.02" dur="5.22">yeah well it just seems like you know it</text><text start="2136.839" dur="3.721">kind of reminds me of Bitcoin started</text><text start="2139.24" dur="3.119">off focused on open source</text><text start="2140.56" dur="3.059">sustainability and it&apos;s since grown in</text><text start="2142.359" dur="3.181">scope to think about lots of different</text><text start="2143.619" dur="5.161">types of public goods but it reminds me</text><text start="2145.54" dur="5.4">of the study that was done in 2014 that</text><text start="2148.78" dur="4.5">they basically figured out that the</text><text start="2150.94" dur="3.84">value of all open source software is</text><text start="2153.28" dur="3.18">that it contributes something like 400</text><text start="2154.78" dur="6.66">billion dollars per year in economic</text><text start="2156.46" dur="7.139">value huge society and answers yeah and</text><text start="2161.44" dur="4.679">so like you know I think we&apos;ve got these</text><text start="2163.599" dur="6.061">similar situations where the economic</text><text start="2166.119" dur="6.121">value of the of the the oceans the</text><text start="2169.66" dur="4.26">biosphere as you said and in in my case</text><text start="2172.24" dur="3.359">coming from open source of Open Source</text><text start="2173.92" dur="4.5">software these things are public goods</text><text start="2175.599" dur="4.5">that generate value for all of us but</text><text start="2178.42" dur="2.88">they&apos;re not integrated into the markets</text><text start="2180.099" dur="3.361">in such a way that people have an</text><text start="2181.3" dur="3.98">incentive to Steward them and it feels</text><text start="2183.46" dur="4.32">like that&apos;s the great great question</text><text start="2185.28" dur="4.66">that&apos;s a great question of of our time</text><text start="2187.78" dur="4.799">is is how do you basically reward the</text><text start="2189.94" dur="4.5">people who are stewarding the you know</text><text start="2192.579" dur="3.721">we can put in economic terms the</text><text start="2194.44" dur="3.6">generators of this economic value but</text><text start="2196.3" dur="3.0">there&apos;s also a moral you know we want to</text><text start="2198.04" dur="2.94">support them because they&apos;re good in</text><text start="2199.3" dur="3.6">their own but like but like how do you</text><text start="2200.98" dur="3.48">find the funding for that in a in the</text><text start="2202.9" dur="4.08">information age like does that come from</text><text start="2204.46" dur="4.379">taxes does that come from Dao&apos;s like the</text><text start="2206.98" dur="5.099">sustainable funding I think is like the</text><text start="2208.839" dur="4.681">the missing part uh and just like</text><text start="2212.079" dur="2.881">creating experiments that work at a</text><text start="2213.52" dur="2.819">small scale and scaling those up and</text><text start="2214.96" dur="3.659">proving that it can happen I think is</text><text start="2216.339" dur="4.02">the big opportunity yeah absolutely and</text><text start="2218.619" dur="3.601">I think you know part of my answer is</text><text start="2220.359" dur="4.041">that it has to come from corporate</text><text start="2222.22" dur="5.22">balance sheets these guys many of them</text><text start="2224.4" dur="4.9">uh to be clear for through no real fault</text><text start="2227.44" dur="4.139">of their own right like I&apos;m not saying</text><text start="2229.3" dur="4.02">they&apos;re blameless but um you run the</text><text start="2231.579" dur="3.601">simulation and you have the agents play</text><text start="2233.32" dur="3.48">take the steps in front of them and you</text><text start="2235.18" dur="3.6">you&apos;re going to lead to many of the same</text><text start="2236.8" dur="3.9">choices right like you can&apos;t rely on</text><text start="2238.78" dur="3.6">people to be like well well I&apos;m just</text><text start="2240.7" dur="3.659">trying to make some clothes bro I don&apos;t</text><text start="2242.38" dur="4.14">really like I&apos;m I&apos;m trying to do fast</text><text start="2244.359" dur="4.141">fashion here I don&apos;t I don&apos;t have my</text><text start="2246.52" dur="3.36">impact on this River priced in because I</text><text start="2248.5" dur="4.56">don&apos;t care right I&apos;m just gonna do this</text><text start="2249.88" dur="4.979">but I think um I really turn to</text><text start="2253.06" dur="3.12">corporates in a lot of my arguments</text><text start="2254.859" dur="2.941">because I think that they&apos;re already</text><text start="2256.18" dur="3.659">participating in some of these markets</text><text start="2257.8" dur="4.74">to a certain degree and we just have to</text><text start="2259.839" dur="4.26">make this more palatable for risk their</text><text start="2262.54" dur="3.6">risk Capital because

dur="5.28">really interesting here is that</text><text start="2294.76" dur="4.859">they also have built a token and staking</text><text start="2297.7" dur="3.72">Dynamic where</text><text start="2299.619" dur="3.841">they&apos;re really trying to court Traders</text><text start="2301.42" dur="3.6">Commodities Traders right they want them</text><text start="2303.46" dur="4.139">to have

I</text><text start="2311.5" dur="4.68">and just to like kind of peg this to a</text><text start="2313.72" dur="3.899">real life example I went to s p Global</text><text start="2316.18" dur="4.02">carbon markets which was a conference</text><text start="2317.619" dur="5.46">here in Barcelona and CME Group Chicago</text><text start="2320.2" dur="4.379">Mercantile Exchange was talking

because you</text><text start="2333.88" dur="3.6">don&apos;t actually just want people to come</text><text start="2335.2" dur="4.26">in and speculate you want people who</text><text start="2337.48" dur="3.72">will speculate but then are actually</text><text start="2339.46" dur="3.54">going to have participate in the market</text><text start="2341.2" dur="3.78">fully and what I mean by that is is if</text><text start="2343.0" dur="4.26">you have an option running even option</text><text start="2344.98" dur="4.56">position running you should have to</text><text start="2347.26" dur="3.9">claim

seeing</text><text start="2481.42" dur="5.58">like a state where the overarching sort</text><text start="2484.359" dur="4.921">of point of that book is that is how</text><text start="2487.0" dur="4.8">plans for you know modernist</text><text start="2489.28" dur="5.579">authoritarian Visions fail right and one</text><text start="2491.8" dur="4.92">of the key points is that they fail by</text><text start="2494.859" dur="4.441">this concept he calls it heroic</text><text start="2496.72" dur="5.16">simplification right like in order for a</text><text start="2499.3" dur="4.98">group

start="2507.16" dur="4.919">they actually are looking at so</text><text start="2510.04" dur="6.0">um this leads to a lot of really adverse</text><text start="2512.079" dur="5.881">outcomes because Central planners uh you</text><text start="2516.04" dur="3.84">probably heard this argument before have</text><text start="2517.96" dur="3.36">to clean away at information and some of</text><text start="2519.88" dur="3.12">that information is really meaningful to</text><text start="2521.32" dur="3.42">the local actors on the ground and so</text><text start="2523.0" dur="4.2">you end up with

dur="5.76">One planned for right and so for me I</text><text start="2533.8" dur="3.539">looked at that book and I was like whoa</text><text start="2536.02" dur="4.38">this is the first time I&apos;ve actually</text><text start="2537.339" dur="5.581">felt uh what I am like as a person right</text><text start="2540.4" dur="4.439">it actually very much made me realize</text><text start="2542.92" dur="4.38">that uh and I had this sent me on a</text><text start="2544.839" dur="5.941">longer sort of you know down a longer</text><text start="2547.3" dur="6.18">Rabbit Hole around a a area

start="2571.06" dur="4.38">states whatever</text><text start="2572.339" dur="4.481">are really utopian in their Visions but</text><text start="2575.44" dur="3.419">if you talk to them about the sleep like</text><text start="2576.82" dur="4.499">absolutely not I did means testing I</text><text start="2578.859" dur="5.22">like did this and the other um but at</text><text start="2581.319" dur="4.741">its heart it&apos;s very trying to do these</text><text start="2584.079" dur="4.861">things on this Grand of a scale without</text><text start="2586.06" dur="3.66">the feedback loops of local actors and</text><text start="2588.94" dur="3.12">the people who are actually being</text><text start="2589.72" dur="5.58">affected is in my opinion very much</text><text start="2592.06" dur="4.98">utopian and so I look around at a lot of</text><text start="2595.3" dur="3.539">the systems that govern our lives and I</text><text start="2597.04" dur="4.38">think they&apos;re like</text><text start="2598.839" dur="4.5">a hideously utopian sometimes with</text><text start="2601.42" dur="3.36">really bad outcomes right and I think</text><text start="2603.339" dur="2.881">you may have even talked about some of</text><text start="2604.78" dur="3.36">these in your pod before right but</text><text start="2606.22" dur="4.5">that&apos;s really where the name comes from</text><text start="2608.14" dur="4.62">is that I think uh you know I&apos;m I&apos;m</text><text start="2610.72" dur="4.139">against that entire idea and I think</text><text start="2612.76" dur="4.26">there are none there are there are not</text><text start="2614.859" dur="3.661">really any of them and I think the only</text><text start="2617.02" dur="3.24">ones that exist are the ones

dur="5.339">way pretty much so I mean I guess the</text><text start="2624.88" dur="4.56">the the definition through the Oxford</text><text start="2627.579" dur="3.0">dictionary of Utopia is an

to this lecture series on</text><text start="2822.28" dur="6.78">YouTube called post-capitalist desires</text><text start="2824.319" dur="8.401">by Mark Fisher and is this this this</text><text start="2829.06" dur="4.68">um this really beautiful vision of you</text><text start="2832.72" dur="3.54">know a</text><text start="2833.74" dur="5.339">uh what what comes after capitalism but</text><text start="2836.26" dur="6.359">it&apos;s also a critique of the left and and</text><text start="2839.079" dur="5.641">sort of the over consumption and uh uh</text><text start="2842.619" dur="5.161">the the sort of like</text><text start="2844.72" dur="5.639">uh the 60s and the 70s it&apos;s a critique</text><text start="2847.78" dur="4.92">of that critique of capitalism in order</text><text start="2850.359" dur="4.26">to arrive at what a more post-capitalist</text><text start="2852.7" dur="4.68">Society uh could look like and then how</text><text start="2854.619" dur="4.141">do our desires get handled in that so um</text><text start="2857.38" dur="2.82">I think it&apos;s a really interesting idea</text><text start="2858.76" dur="3.96">space that maybe I want to explore more</text><text start="2860.2" dur="5.1">in the future for sure and I think Mark</text><text start="2862.72" dur="4.619">Fisher check out capitalist realism if</text><text start="2865.3" dur="4.74">you haven&apos;t read it it&apos;s uh it&apos;s a quick</text><text start="2867.339" dur="4.801">little read and it kind of it definitely</text><text start="2870.04" dur="3.779">changed my mind a lot of things but the</text><text start="2872.14" dur="2.699">whole the point of it is basically he</text><text start="2873.819" dur="3.061">had been dealing with a lot of</text><text start="2874.839" dur="3.541">depression at the time and basically</text><text start="2876.88" dur="4.32">thinking like</text><text start="2878.38" dur="4.62">um how how is it such that in our in his</text><text start="2881.2" dur="3.72">time or I think he had committed suicide</text><text start="2883.0" dur="4.2">in 2017 or so but</text><text start="2884.92" dur="4.5">um you know this is like 2012. his whole</text><text start="2887.2" dur="4.1">point with the book was essentially how</text><text start="2889.42" dur="5.159">is it that whenever we try to imagine</text><text start="2891.3" dur="5.62">new possibilities they all happen within</text><text start="2894.579" dur="4.381">like market-based capitalism right how</text><text start="2896.92" dur="4.86">is it that capitalism subsumes how and</text><text start="2898.96" dur="5.04">why right and so that that ends up being</text><text start="2901.78" dur="3.6">that like a quick little study on that</text><text start="2904.0" dur="2.52">and</text><text start="2905.38" dur="3.0">um the other thing too like you&apos;re</text><text start="2906.52" dur="4.02">talking about with the left</text><text start="2908.38" dur="3.719">um you know he that was basically is</text><text start="2910.54" dur="3.059">that was the last few years of his work</text><text start="2912.099" dur="3.72">I&apos;d say the last two or three years this</text><text start="2913.599" dur="4.081">work was very much focused on that</text><text start="2915.819" dur="4.141">um not not like necessarily punching</text><text start="2917.68" dur="4.919">left but more just saying like how can</text><text start="2919.96" dur="4.8">the various groups of people who call</text><text start="2922.599" dur="4.801">themselves the left work together</text><text start="2924.76" dur="4.92">through the left and get past this</text><text start="2927.4" dur="4.32">concept to something that&apos;s a bit more</text><text start="2929.68" dur="5.159">viable because I&apos;ll tell you</text><text start="2931.72" dur="5.099">why do I you know why do I do it I do I</text><text start="2934.839" dur="4.02">think that there&apos;s a lot of folks who</text><text start="2936.819" dur="3.361">are you know you going back to an</text><text start="2938.859" dur="2.821">earlier thing you had said about you</text><text start="2940.18" dur="2.88">know Charities or what have you right</text><text start="2941.68" dur="3.72">like are some of these things Charities</text><text start="2943.06" dur="5.34">or not it&apos;s um</text><text start="2945.4" dur="4.86">I one of my Theses is that if we open up</text><text start="2948.4" dur="5.64">participation to these systems to more</text><text start="2950.26" dur="6.359">people expand the agency of humans we</text><text start="2954.04" dur="4.74">should be able to compete against you</text><text start="2956.619" dur="4.5">know Market capitalist firms monopolist</text><text start="2958.78" dur="4.38">firms duopolis foreign parts of the</text><text start="2961.119" dur="3.72">economy because we are better</text><text start="2963.16" dur="3.54">information processors we&apos;re more</text><text start="2964.839" dur="3.24">resilient and offering some of the</text><text start="2966.7" dur="4.08">things you touched on earlier too with</text><text start="2968.079" dur="4.861">the anti-frat with anti-fragility and</text><text start="2970.78" dur="4.2">all we need is the right is just to be</text><text start="2972.94" dur="5.22">able to compete and see what happens</text><text start="2974.98" dur="4.92">right in my opinion and that&apos;s really</text><text start="2978.16" dur="2.64">what I see is like the promise of the</text><text start="2979.9" dur="2.82">stuff</text><text start="2980.8" dur="4.799">mm-hmm</text><text start="2982.72" dur="4.44">yeah well um I think it&apos;s been really</text><text start="2985.599" dur="3.061">great to have
