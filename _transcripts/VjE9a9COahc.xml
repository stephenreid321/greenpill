dur="4.321">uh sure so</text><text start="218.319" dur="2.801">i guess establishing is maybe a bit</text><text start="219.92" dur="3.52">strong and</text><text start="221.12" dur="4.32">so me personally i&apos;m just one of many</text><text start="223.44" dur="5.6">members um</text><text start="225.44" dur="5.92">it&apos;s been really a collective project uh</text><text start="229.04" dur="4.399">given that it&apos;s made of you know members</text><text start="231.36" dur="4.799">from many different client teams it&apos;s</text><text start="233.439" dur="3.601">not just me though i am like the</text><text start="236.159" dur="2.8">maybe</text><text start="237.04" dur="3.279">the public face is is a little strong</text><text start="238.959" dur="2.961">given it&apos;s only been around for a few</text><text start="240.319" dur="3.681">months but people are starting to</text><text start="241.92" dur="4.399">associate me with it but really like</text><text start="244.0" dur="4.159">this this collective effort wouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="246.319" dur="3.601">uh it wouldn&apos;t exist at all if it didn&apos;t</text><text start="248.159" dur="3.201">have buy-in and membership from all</text><text start="249.92" dur="3.679">these client teams and you know their</text><text start="251.36" dur="3.599">involvement so uh maybe that&apos;s important</text><text start="253.599" dur="3.281">context but</text><text start="254.959" dur="4.161">um so yeah</text><text start="256.88" dur="4.0">why did i create it or why have i why</text><text start="259.12" dur="3.92">have i put my time into something like</text><text start="260.88" dur="3.44">this um i guess the answer is so i&apos;ve</text><text start="263.04" dur="2.4">been</text><text start="264.32" dur="3.36">um</text><text start="265.44" dur="3.52">adjacent to protocol development for a</text><text start="267.68" dur="4.239">couple years now</text><text start="268.96" dur="4.56">uh you know just going to core dev calls</text><text start="271.919" dur="3.121">observing mostly i don&apos;t really have a</text><text start="273.52" dur="3.36">ton to contribute on these chord f calls</text><text start="275.04" dur="3.12">but you know getting familiar with the</text><text start="276.88" dur="3.2">people and</text><text start="278.16" dur="3.36">the players the client teams people who</text><text start="280.08" dur="2.48">are contributing to core ethereum</text><text start="281.52" dur="1.41">protocol</text><text start="282.56" dur="2.079">um</text><text start="282.93" dur="3.549">[Music]</text><text start="284.639" dur="5.28">and over the years i&apos;ve just gotten more</text><text start="286.479" dur="4.72">familiar with how this space works um</text><text start="289.919" dur="3.361">core protocol is different from the</text><text start="291.199" dur="4.72">application and layer you know where a</text><text start="293.28" dur="5.68">lot of user facing stuff happens and</text><text start="295.919" dur="5.361">over time it became apparent that uh you</text><text start="298.96" dur="4.16">know the incentives uh to build on the</text><text start="301.28" dur="3.359">application layer are much much</text><text start="303.12" dur="4.4">different than contributing to the core</text><text start="304.639" dur="5.041">protocol so you know one of those is</text><text start="307.52" dur="3.76">financial incentives it&apos;s the reality of</text><text start="309.68" dur="4.239">how things work</text><text start="311.28" dur="4.479">an application can have a token</text><text start="313.919" dur="4.321">and you know the upside of working on a</text><text start="315.759" dur="5.841">project like that or a layer two</text><text start="318.24" dur="5.36">that has a token is much much higher so</text><text start="321.6" dur="4.8">part of it is like you know</text><text start="323.6" dur="5.92">it would be nice if there was a way for</text><text start="326.4" dur="6.16">these uh protocol devs to share in some</text><text start="329.52" dur="5.28">form of this upside um</text><text start="332.56" dur="3.6">financial upside specifically uh and</text><text start="334.8" dur="3.36">they were also</text><text start="336.16" dur="3.12">um you know over the years there have</text><text start="338.16" dur="2.0">been</text><text start="339.28" dur="4.0">um</text><text start="340.16" dur="5.2">applications or layer twos whales people</text><text start="343.28" dur="3.68">with with assets who are like okay i</text><text start="345.36" dur="3.52">want to donate to core devs how can i do</text><text start="346.96" dur="4.88">this and you know there have been a</text><text start="348.88" dur="4.48">couple projects over the years</text><text start="351.84" dur="3.76">i&apos;ve been i&apos;ve been involved in a couple</text><text start="353.36" dur="4.559">of them there was uh molok dao which is</text><text start="355.6" dur="4.56">like one of the earliest examples where</text><text start="357.919" dur="5.441">people who had eath would kind of band</text><text start="360.16" dur="5.36">together and um</text><text start="363.36" dur="3.92">they got together put their eat in this</text><text start="365.52" dur="4.399">contract and then would disperse it to</text><text start="367.28" dur="3.44">community projects um really one of the</text><text start="369.919" dur="2.72">first</text><text start="370.72" dur="4.0">experiments in</text><text start="372.639" dur="3.12">community funding of different projects</text><text start="374.72" dur="2.88">throughout the ecosystem and there was a</text><text start="375.759" dur="2.56">lot of great outcomes from that some</text><text start="377.6" dur="3.28">like</text><text start="378.319" dur="5.121">research studies produced uh tornado</text><text start="380.88" dur="4.64">cache came out of molok dao um and then</text><text start="383.44" dur="3.759">i was i was involved in it as well</text><text start="385.52" dur="4.16">dispersing some money and then other</text><text start="387.199" dur="5.361">experiments like um</text><text start="389.68" dur="4.079">open grants which is a vested e-stream</text><text start="392.56" dur="2.56">um</text><text start="393.759" dur="3.681">and then i did a couple other projects</text><text start="395.12" dur="4.639">here and there like uh the beacon book</text><text start="397.44" dur="4.479">which was a book that had some nfts</text><text start="399.759" dur="3.761">associated with it and then any eat that</text><text start="401.919" dur="4.321">was raised went to</text><text start="403.52" dur="4.16">the the core protocol people who were</text><text start="406.24" dur="3.44">involved in launching the beacon chain</text><text start="407.68" dur="3.68">and then last year we also did</text><text start="409.68" dur="3.76">1559</text><text start="411.36" dur="5.119">nft series which is again going to</text><text start="413.44" dur="6.319">people who worked on um</text><text start="416.479" dur="5.12">1559 the the protocol upgrade so there&apos;s</text><text start="419.759" dur="3.44">been a bunch of these stuff over the</text><text start="421.599" dur="3.201">years that i&apos;ve started to like</text><text start="423.199" dur="3.44">experiment with and be involved with</text><text start="424.8" dur="3.519">about how do we get</text><text start="426.639" dur="3.361">this value</text><text start="428.319" dur="3.921">back to people who are maintaining doing</text><text start="430.0" dur="4.56">the crucial maintenance work of keeping</text><text start="432.24" dur="5.28">ethereum alive and evolving for the long</text><text start="434.56" dur="5.12">term um and finally we came to this</text><text start="437.52" dur="3.679">point from you know those experiments</text><text start="439.68" dur="3.12">and mutual discussions with people of</text><text start="441.199" dur="3.201">like okay there needs to be this</text><text start="442.8" dur="3.92">mechanism of</text><text start="444.4" dur="2.32">um</text><text start="447.12" dur="2.799">it needs to have an on chain</text><text start="448.24" dur="5.04">representation and it should treat the</text><text start="449.919" dur="5.761">individual as sort of the the</text><text start="453.28" dur="3.84">atomic unit it shouldn&apos;t go to a team it</text><text start="455.68" dur="3.2">shouldn&apos;t go to</text><text start="457.12" dur="3.519">uh somebody else that can interrupt the</text><text start="458.88" dur="2.96">flow of that value so</text><text start="460.639" dur="2.721">um</text><text start="461.84" dur="3.6">you know i guess i&apos;ll summarize because</text><text start="463.36" dur="3.679">i&apos;ve been talking well but the</text><text start="465.44" dur="4.0">the intent is to like share some of that</text><text start="467.039" dur="5.361">financial upside the incentive that</text><text start="469.44" dur="4.08">people miss out on when they&apos;re um</text><text start="472.4" dur="2.72">when they&apos;re contributing to the core</text><text start="473.52" dur="2.64">protocol and then</text><text start="475.12" dur="2.4">uh</text><text start="476.16" dur="3.439">you know some of the design decisions</text><text start="477.52" dur="4.72">were informed of these other experiments</text><text start="479.599" dur="4.561">that i&apos;ve done over the years um</text><text start="482.24" dur="3.92">but yeah those those are kind of the big</text><text start="484.16" dur="3.12">big picture idea of why this thing is</text><text start="486.16" dur="2.879">necessary</text><text start="487.28" dur="3.84">got it seems like you&apos;ve been working on</text><text start="489.039" dur="3.921">ecosystem development for a few years</text><text start="491.12" dur="4.0">i&apos;d be curious</text><text start="492.96" dur="3.84">how this has evolved for you has have</text><text start="495.12" dur="4.24">you always been into public goods</text><text start="496.8" dur="4.48">ecosystem public goods and how has your</text><text start="499.36" dur="4.32">views sort of evolved through all these</text><text start="501.28" dur="5.84">different projects and how has that led</text><text start="503.68" dur="4.4">you to the to the protocol guild sure</text><text start="507.12" dur="1.53">so</text><text start="508.08" dur="2.959">um</text><text start="508.65" dur="4.47">[Music]</text><text start="511.039" dur="4.081">yeah i was doing this i guess for like</text><text start="513.12" dur="3.599">like i mentioned i was sort of adjacent</text><text start="515.12" dur="2.88">to the protocol for</text><text start="516.719" dur="3.281">years and like</text><text start="518.0" dur="3.519">just showing up on core of calls when</text><text start="520.0" dur="3.36">and when really i have like no business</text><text start="521.519" dur="3.681">being there i&apos;m just kind of along for</text><text start="523.36" dur="5.599">the ride and and the weirdness that</text><text start="525.2" dur="3.759">we&apos;re all making here um</text><text start="529.2" dur="4.56">uh but it it my interest probably</text><text start="531.839" dur="2.56">started um you know i&apos;ve always been</text><text start="533.76" dur="2.639">like</text><text start="534.399" dur="4.241">probably a little bit more left-leaning</text><text start="536.399" dur="4.401">politically and like you know public</text><text start="538.64" dur="3.12">goods are kind of a key tenet of like</text><text start="540.8" dur="3.44">the state should have some</text><text start="541.76" dur="4.72">responsibility towards um</text><text start="544.24" dur="3.84">you know making sure its citizens are</text><text start="546.48" dur="2.64">taken care of the market can&apos;t solve</text><text start="548.08" dur="2.64">everything so that&apos;s probably where a</text><text start="549.12" dur="3.2">little bit of it comes from but you know</text><text start="550.72" dur="3.36">even from the early days the stuff</text><text start="552.32" dur="5.199">bitcoin was doing was always like pretty</text><text start="554.08" dur="4.879">amazing to me of like you&apos;re able to</text><text start="557.519" dur="3.281">mobilize</text><text start="558.959" dur="4.961">uh capital that would be doing something</text><text start="560.8" dur="5.039">else completely and put it towards</text><text start="563.92" dur="4.32">projects that wouldn&apos;t be able to access</text><text start="565.839" dur="4.161">that that funding in any way um so</text><text start="568.24" dur="5.2">that&apos;s probably where my first like</text><text start="570.0" dur="5.76">crypto public goods things uh</text><text start="573.44" dur="4.0">where it first originated um and then</text><text start="575.76" dur="2.56">just the idea of like</text><text start="577.44" dur="3.519">uh</text><text start="578.32" dur="5.199">you know ethereum</text><text start="580.959" dur="4.721">bootstrapped itself it it had the the</text><text start="583.519" dur="3.681">initial pre-sale and then took those</text><text start="585.68" dur="4.24">funds and it&apos;s just kind of like pouring</text><text start="587.2" dur="4.319">money into creating this novel internet</text><text start="589.92" dur="3.2">infrastructure so like all of these</text><text start="591.519" dur="4.0">different influences were probably</text><text start="593.12" dur="2.399">important</text><text start="595.68" dur="2.64">right</text><text start="596.8" dur="3.68">and um</text><text start="598.32" dur="4.639">i guess like can you take me through the</text><text start="600.48" dur="5.12">the protocol guild how does it work and</text><text start="602.959" dur="6.0">and you know what will the first</text><text start="605.6" dur="4.64">iteration of it of it look like</text><text start="608.959" dur="3.041">sure sure</text><text start="610.24" dur="4.32">uh so</text><text start="612.0" dur="4.88">in like the most basic explanation of</text><text start="614.56" dur="4.719">what this thing is it&apos;s a</text><text start="616.88" dur="5.04">it&apos;s an on-chain contract a weighted</text><text start="619.279" dur="4.8">split contract that the membership</text><text start="621.92" dur="4.24">self-curates and</text><text start="624.079" dur="2.961">it vests over time those are kind of the</text><text start="626.16" dur="2.64">key</text><text start="627.04" dur="4.479">the key components for what this thing</text><text start="628.8" dur="4.479">is and um</text><text start="631.519" dur="4.481">i mean we can we can we can dive into</text><text start="633.279" dur="4.24">what that actually means um</text><text start="636.0" dur="3.76">what we actually get out of it is this</text><text start="637.519" dur="3.841">sort of if you take a step back it&apos;s</text><text start="639.76" dur="4.56">like i mentioned earlier it&apos;s like</text><text start="641.36" dur="4.159">recognizing the individual as the atomic</text><text start="644.32" dur="2.72">unit for</text><text start="645.519" dur="3.041">um</text><text start="647.04" dur="3.84">what who&apos;s building the protocol</text><text start="648.56" dur="4.24">obviously individuals slot into teams</text><text start="650.88" dur="2.72">but in reality they&apos;re</text><text start="652.8" dur="2.4">uh</text><text start="653.6" dur="4.239">recognizing sort of the sovereignty of</text><text start="655.2" dur="5.28">what individuals are doing</text><text start="657.839" dur="4.161">the membership of the split goes to the</text><text start="660.48" dur="3.2">individual to</text><text start="662.0" dur="3.44">do whatever they&apos;d like to</text><text start="663.68" dur="2.8">um</text><text start="665.44" dur="2.639">and</text><text start="666.48" dur="3.12">those are the kind of the key components</text><text start="668.079" dur="4.961">um</text><text start="669.6" dur="5.28">uh vesting is important sorry go ahead</text><text start="673.04" dur="3.76">oh i was gonna say one of the things</text><text start="674.88" dur="3.519">that i just felt was really smart like i</text><text start="676.8" dur="2.88">guess elegant about this design was</text><text start="678.399" dur="2.721">having the individuals who are building</text><text start="679.68" dur="2.88">the protocol being the ones who are</text><text start="681.12" dur="4.24">curating the list</text><text start="682.56" dur="5.04">of where the money goes which kind of</text><text start="685.36" dur="3.039">creates that that locality of the</text><text start="687.6" dur="3.04">knowledge</text><text start="688.399" dur="4.88">it also reflects in the smart contract</text><text start="690.64" dur="4.08">so it just seemed very elegant to me</text><text start="693.279" dur="4.161">yeah um</text><text start="694.72" dur="5.44">i i i can&apos;t claim uh</text><text start="697.44" dur="4.959">exact invention of that but like uh</text><text start="700.16" dur="4.64">i was just listening to your recording</text><text start="702.399" dur="4.401">with tracheoptrix</text><text start="704.8" dur="3.68">uh and you know that&apos;s a huge</text><text start="706.8" dur="3.279">inspiration is like</text><text start="708.48" dur="3.28">the people who are actually working on</text><text start="710.079" dur="4.641">this stuff are the ones who are doing</text><text start="711.76" dur="6.4">the curation that&apos;s like um</text><text start="714.72" dur="4.799">massive influence on on what this is um</text><text start="718.16" dur="2.799">and then i mentioned</text><text start="719.519" dur="3.041">if anybody is interested in reading the</text><text start="720.959" dur="3.12">docs i&apos;m sure they&apos;ll be</text><text start="722.56" dur="3.2">um</text><text start="724.079" dur="2.961">linked in the show notes but a key</text><text start="725.76" dur="3.44">component of this is yeah that&apos;s</text><text start="727.04" dur="3.68">self-curation and the reason it&apos;s a</text><text start="729.2" dur="3.28">little different from other solutions</text><text start="730.72" dur="3.84">like um</text><text start="732.48" dur="4.24">bitcoin uh or</text><text start="734.56" dur="3.68">optimism&apos;s retroactive public goods</text><text start="736.72" dur="3.2">there&apos;s some nuance there as to why</text><text start="738.24" dur="2.88">self-curation is important so i&apos;ll go</text><text start="739.92" dur="2.24">through that really quick</text><text start="741.12" dur="3.2">um</text><text start="742.16" dur="4.16">you know git coin uses the the wisdom of</text><text start="744.32" dur="4.079">the crowd and and people who are</text><text start="746.32" dur="3.519">actually using these products to</text><text start="748.399" dur="2.481">understand</text><text start="749.839" dur="3.68">what</text><text start="750.88" dur="3.519">should get the the largest allocations</text><text start="753.519" dur="2.401">right</text><text start="754.399" dur="3.521">um</text><text start="755.92" dur="4.4">unfortunately for core development and</text><text start="757.92" dur="4.719">the protocol itself it&apos;s</text><text start="760.32" dur="4.0">really hard to have an accurate view</text><text start="762.639" dur="3.76">into some of this stuff you know it&apos;s</text><text start="764.32" dur="3.04">really technically complicated</text><text start="766.399" dur="2.961">um</text><text start="767.36" dur="4.24">the people who are working on it usually</text><text start="769.36" dur="4.56">don&apos;t have a git coin grant or they may</text><text start="771.6" dur="4.16">not have like a public profile</text><text start="773.92" dur="3.919">so it&apos;s really hard for the average</text><text start="775.76" dur="3.84">ethereum community member to</text><text start="777.839" dur="3.041">understand how</text><text start="779.6" dur="2.96">uh</text><text start="780.88" dur="4.56">or how to wait between these different</text><text start="782.56" dur="4.56">projects um the other thing is like</text><text start="785.44" dur="4.0">uh</text><text start="787.12" dur="4.159">ethereum has a multi-client culture so</text><text start="789.44" dur="4.079">you wouldn&apos;t want to be sort of pitting</text><text start="791.279" dur="4.0">these projects against each other</text><text start="793.519" dur="3.681">like competitively like oh you should</text><text start="795.279" dur="3.521">donate to this client or this client if</text><text start="797.2" dur="4.079">you were to ask people</text><text start="798.8" dur="4.159">what is a public good what is the core</text><text start="801.279" dur="2.881">client of ethereum or like the core</text><text start="802.959" dur="3.68">protocol</text><text start="804.16" dur="5.2">components they would i probably 80 or</text><text start="806.639" dur="4.961">90 would say guess like that&apos;s their</text><text start="809.36" dur="5.599">understanding of what the client</text><text start="811.6" dur="5.039">landscape is but in reality you know uh</text><text start="814.959" dur="3.041">or if you&apos;ve seen</text><text start="816.639" dur="3.681">and i think we talked about this before</text><text start="818.0" dur="4.32">but the protocol guild is over a hundred</text><text start="820.32" dur="3.92">members now and most people</text><text start="822.32" dur="4.0">uh the a few that i&apos;ve interacted with</text><text start="824.24" dur="4.24">are like wow this is actually way larger</text><text start="826.32" dur="3.92">than i anticipated or you know</text><text start="828.48" dur="3.52">which is totally understandable given</text><text start="830.24" dur="5.279">people don&apos;t have the time to understand</text><text start="832.0" dur="5.279">like the just the breadth of uh</text><text start="835.519" dur="2.401">who&apos;s actually making the protocol work</text><text start="837.279" dur="2.481">and</text><text start="837.92" dur="3.44">what goes into maintaining it it&apos;s a lot</text><text start="839.76" dur="2.8">more than people understand</text><text start="841.36" dur="3.52">so that&apos;s one of the reasons why</text><text start="842.56" dur="4.48">bitcoin&apos;s a little different and why</text><text start="844.88" dur="4.72">uh the benefit that we get from</text><text start="847.04" dur="4.88">self-curation is that um</text><text start="849.6" dur="5.359">i think jordan hall said like or one of</text><text start="851.92" dur="4.8">your recent guests said</text><text start="854.959" dur="3.201">the the knowledge is like pushed or the</text><text start="856.72" dur="3.28">curation has pushed the edges of the</text><text start="858.16" dur="4.479">network and that&apos;s that&apos;s a really great</text><text start="860.0" dur="5.199">way to frame it because uh</text><text start="862.639" dur="3.681">like if it were if it were just me</text><text start="865.199" dur="2.88">or</text><text start="866.32" dur="5.12">uh like some</text><text start="868.079" dur="6.481">somebody at the ef who is um</text><text start="871.44" dur="5.36">curating people and trying to to</text><text start="874.56" dur="3.519">delineate those relationships exactly</text><text start="876.8" dur="3.599">there&apos;s always going to be somewhere</text><text start="878.079" dur="3.44">where it falls short um so when you say</text><text start="880.399" dur="4.401">okay</text><text start="881.519" dur="4.721">client x tell me the the 10 or 15 people</text><text start="884.8" dur="2.88">who are contributing to your client and</text><text start="886.24" dur="2.88">who deserve to be on this split and</text><text start="887.68" dur="3.68">they&apos;ll be like okay i&apos;ve got the exact</text><text start="889.12" dur="4.8">list i know the exact contributors and</text><text start="891.36" dur="4.56">the capacity they&apos;re working um</text><text start="893.92" dur="3.279">that&apos;s uh</text><text start="895.92" dur="2.719">really the best way to do it and then</text><text start="897.199" dur="2.32">other things like retroactive public</text><text start="898.639" dur="2.88">goods</text><text start="899.519" dur="3.361">uh funding like optimism&apos;s experiment</text><text start="901.519" dur="2.961">they they use a little bit of a</text><text start="902.88" dur="3.44">different model but they have a council</text><text start="904.48" dur="3.76">of these badge holders which do the</text><text start="906.32" dur="4.959">curation and then they do like a ranking</text><text start="908.24" dur="3.039">vote um</text><text start="911.519" dur="3.601">uh i think one of the key things that we</text><text start="913.44" dur="3.839">really wanted to push for with the</text><text start="915.12" dur="3.6">protocol guild is again having that</text><text start="917.279" dur="2.8">autonomy and if you were to have some</text><text start="918.72" dur="4.72">sort of council</text><text start="920.079" dur="4.161">or uh like external people that have to</text><text start="923.44" dur="2.16">then</text><text start="924.24" dur="3.76">evaluate</text><text start="925.6" dur="4.4">similar to if it were you know</text><text start="928.0" dur="3.519">uh the ef or somebody else who&apos;s making</text><text start="930.0" dur="3.519">these evaluations</text><text start="931.519" dur="3.76">it it loses a bit of that autonomy and</text><text start="933.519" dur="4.88">independence so you know the membership</text><text start="935.279" dur="5.68">curates itself uh we&apos;re hoping hoping</text><text start="938.399" dur="5.12">that it will work you know long term and</text><text start="940.959" dur="4.88">it doesn&apos;t degrade or or you know just</text><text start="943.519" dur="3.601">completely fail but uh we&apos;ll see how</text><text start="945.839" dur="2.961">that goes</text><text start="947.12" dur="3.6">right speaking of long term i know that</text><text start="948.8" dur="3.68">you mentioned vesting is a core</text><text start="950.72" dur="4.0">component here so how are you thinking</text><text start="952.48" dur="4.56">about incentives for people who maintain</text><text start="954.72" dur="4.96">the protocol over time</text><text start="957.04" dur="5.919">and how that vests</text><text start="959.68" dur="4.959">right so one of the key like</text><text start="962.959" dur="3.601">one of the key things i&apos;ve noticed and</text><text start="964.639" dur="4.081">in discussions with other people</text><text start="966.56" dur="4.079">who work on core devs is like the core</text><text start="968.72" dur="4.4">development is that</text><text start="970.639" dur="5.12">uh it can take quite a while to</text><text start="973.12" dur="4.88">sort of ramp up into understanding</text><text start="975.759" dur="4.481">um not just the technical</text><text start="978.0" dur="3.68">aspects of what protocol development is</text><text start="980.24" dur="2.56">but also like</text><text start="981.68" dur="2.959">the</text><text start="982.8" dur="2.959">the unique ecosystem we&apos;re working in</text><text start="984.639" dur="2.401">you know</text><text start="985.759" dur="3.681">there&apos;s</text><text start="987.04" dur="4.799">an upgrade cycle there&apos;s release cycles</text><text start="989.44" dur="4.24">that may not correspond with something</text><text start="991.839" dur="4.56">you&apos;d see in like a traditional</text><text start="993.68" dur="6.0">uh software startup there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="996.399" dur="5.12">considerations beyond just like okay we</text><text start="999.68" dur="3.92">write the client and then we release it</text><text start="1001.519" dur="4.24">but you like</text><text start="1003.6" dur="4.08">the the context is there&apos;s a lot more at</text><text start="1005.759" dur="4.561">stake here like you have basically a</text><text start="1007.68" dur="4.56">mini economy running on your platform so</text><text start="1010.32" dur="3.92">stuff has to be</text><text start="1012.24" dur="3.599">for better or worse it has to be right</text><text start="1014.24" dur="3.039">when it goes out</text><text start="1015.839" dur="4.0">so it can take a while for people to</text><text start="1017.279" dur="4.641">onboard and understand clients and</text><text start="1019.839" dur="4.48">once people sort of cross that threshold</text><text start="1021.92" dur="3.919">or you know move further on the spectrum</text><text start="1024.319" dur="4.081">you want to keep them around as long as</text><text start="1025.839" dur="4.641">possible and once they get to that point</text><text start="1028.4" dur="4.08">where they&apos;re like you know six to nine</text><text start="1030.48" dur="2.959">months into joining a client team or</text><text start="1032.48" dur="1.76">something</text><text start="1033.439" dur="3.441">you</text><text start="1034.24" dur="5.28">they they start to like really uh</text><text start="1036.88" dur="5.679">hit their stride and contribute</text><text start="1039.52" dur="5.279">in in ways that are positive um so like</text><text start="1042.559" dur="3.601">i said once they cross that threshold</text><text start="1044.799" dur="2.721">you want to keep them around as long as</text><text start="1046.16" dur="3.92">possible</text><text start="1047.52" dur="4.08">um and one of the ways that we&apos;re</text><text start="1050.08" dur="4.56">attacking that with the protocol guild</text><text start="1051.6" dur="6.72">is the the vesting feature um and it&apos;s</text><text start="1054.64" dur="3.68">just like a linear vest and</text><text start="1059.12" dur="4.48">the the intent is like you get people to</text><text start="1061.36" dur="4.559">accumulate this knowledge and then pass</text><text start="1063.6" dur="3.52">it on to whoever the next generation is</text><text start="1065.919" dur="2.801">and for the</text><text start="1067.12" dur="3.28">for the um</text><text start="1068.72" dur="3.199">the the pilot we&apos;re working on it&apos;s</text><text start="1070.4" dur="3.36">we&apos;re gonna probably target like a year</text><text start="1071.919" dur="4.241">for the the linear vest</text><text start="1073.76" dur="3.76">and then uh</text><text start="1076.16" dur="3.44">i think even in the future we would do</text><text start="1077.52" dur="3.519">something like a four-year vest i don&apos;t</text><text start="1079.6" dur="3.52">know if i don&apos;t know if we&apos;re leaning</text><text start="1081.039" dur="4.561">towards that because that&apos;s how long a</text><text start="1083.12" dur="5.28">typical market cycle is or something but</text><text start="1085.6" dur="4.8">um you know raised at the bottom of the</text><text start="1088.4" dur="4.24">the bear market and then</text><text start="1090.4" dur="4.32">uh see what happens afterwards but yeah</text><text start="1092.64" dur="4.64">four years seems like a good</text><text start="1094.72" dur="5.28">uh balance ten years feels a little long</text><text start="1097.28" dur="5.519">um but yeah that&apos;s the intended to keep</text><text start="1100.0" dur="4.72">that that accumulated uh maybe</text><text start="1102.799" dur="3.681">institutional knowledge isn&apos;t the right</text><text start="1104.72" dur="3.839">thing but it&apos;s the network knowledge of</text><text start="1106.48" dur="3.76">these people who are contributing and</text><text start="1108.559" dur="2.561">understand you know the quirks of the</text><text start="1110.24" dur="3.84">client</text><text start="1111.12" dur="3.84">and uh the</text><text start="1114.08" dur="2.56">the</text><text start="1114.96" dur="3.76">you know the oddities of the code base</text><text start="1116.64" dur="4.32">and and just you know all that knowledge</text><text start="1118.72" dur="4.079">you want to keep it around and sort of</text><text start="1120.96" dur="4.079">get that mind virus transmitted to as</text><text start="1122.799" dur="3.041">many people as possible</text><text start="1125.039" dur="3.121">right</text><text start="1125.84" dur="4.4">so take me through a world in which the</text><text start="1128.16" dur="4.0">protocol guild is maximally successful</text><text start="1130.24" dur="3.52">it sounds like we believe that the</text><text start="1132.16" dur="4.56">protocol work is a public good for the</text><text start="1133.76" dur="5.279">ethereum ecosystem and when the protocol</text><text start="1136.72" dur="3.28">guild has reached a sufficient size and</text><text start="1139.039" dur="2.321">scale</text><text start="1140.0" dur="2.88">then the people who work on that</text><text start="1141.36" dur="3.28">protocol and create the basis for all</text><text start="1142.88" dur="4.4">the economic value are rewarded which is</text><text start="1144.64" dur="4.48">a moral sort of good in itself but also</text><text start="1147.28" dur="4.56">it&apos;s kind of solves a retainment problem</text><text start="1149.12" dur="4.24">where if you can go make five times x by</text><text start="1151.84" dur="3.199">working at the app layer instead of the</text><text start="1153.36" dur="4.16">protocol layer it kind of solves that</text><text start="1155.039" dur="4.481">retainment problem what other what else</text><text start="1157.52" dur="3.84">does the world look like where when</text><text start="1159.52" dur="3.36">protocol guild is is maximally</text><text start="1161.36" dur="4.72">successful you know what&apos;s your kind of</text><text

a lot of</text><text start="1596.24" dur="4.96">heavy theory about you know what what</text><text start="1599.919" dur="4.24">what is the relationship between</text><text start="1601.2"

deeper drawn in um still</text><text start="1728.159" dur="3.601">working in architecture and</text><text start="1730.24" dur="3.36">uh eventually</text><text start="1731.76" dur="4.0">realized that like</text><text start="1733.6" dur="4.48">i don&apos;t have to be stuck in this this</text><text start="1735.76" dur="3.76">field or this profession which is like</text><text start="1738.08" dur="3.68">first completely different from what i</text><text start="1739.52" dur="4.24">expected from school and like it&apos;s very</text><text start="1741.76" dur="2.88">clearly not affecting change in the</text><text start="1743.76" dur="2.639">world</text><text start="1744.64" dur="3.6">uh how i imagined it to be and then i</text><text start="1746.399" dur="4.561">remember like some early</text><text start="1748.24" dur="5.36">devcon talks from</text><text start="1750.96" dur="3.599">like vitalik and maybe alex van der sand</text><text start="1753.6" dur="2.799">of</text><text start="1754.559" dur="2.561">you know here&apos;s this these crazy ideas</text><text start="1756.399" dur="3.121">for</text><text start="1757.12" dur="4.48">like a user-owned internet and and the</text><text start="1759.52" dur="3.68">applications that we can have on it and</text><text start="1761.6" dur="3.84">you know i was like well that&apos;s sick</text><text start="1763.2" dur="4.16">like i want to be a part of this um and</text><text start="1765.44" dur="3.44">like yeah just got deeper and deeper</text><text start="1767.36" dur="3.199">into</text><text start="1768.88" dur="2.96">um</text><text start="1770.559" dur="4.161">what</text><text start="1771.84" dur="4.64">what ethereum is and then like you know</text><text start="1774.72" dur="3.04">trying to make it what it is today and</text><text start="1776.48" dur="2.48">what it&apos;s going to be in the future so</text><text start="1777.76" dur="3.6">i&apos;ve worked for a couple different</text><text start="1778.96" dur="4.8">companies um</text><text start="1781.36" dur="5.039">uh white bloc</text><text start="1783.76" dur="5.039">eth global which does online hackathons</text><text start="1786.399" dur="4.801">and and now in-person hackathons again</text><text start="1788.799" dur="6.0">and now i work at the ef um doing</text><text start="1791.2" dur="5.76">ecosystem stuff so i&apos;m working uh</text><text start="1794.799" dur="3.76">with the core dev call which organizes</text><text start="1796.96" dur="5.04">all the client teams together every two</text><text start="1798.559" dur="5.041">weeks and uh plans network upgrades</text><text start="1802.0" dur="3.919">plans changes to the protocol for</text><text start="1803.6" dur="4.079">example like 1559 you if you&apos;re a</text><text start="1805.919" dur="4.321">listener maybe you&apos;ve maybe you&apos;ve heard</text><text start="1807.679" dur="4.321">of this um it was a pretty big upgrade</text><text start="1810.24" dur="3.919">last year which changed the the fee</text><text start="1812.0" dur="4.0">protocol for ethereum and you know</text><text start="1814.159" dur="3.52">uh started to burn some of the ether as</text><text start="1816.0" dur="4.0">part of that that&apos;s maybe what&apos;s your</text><text start="1817.679" dur="4.321">reference your reference point is um but</text><text start="1820.0" dur="4.32">that all goes through like the core dev</text><text start="1822.0" dur="4.48">process and people refining proposals</text><text start="1824.32" dur="5.12">and coming to consensus on the way</text><text start="1826.48" dur="4.88">something should be designed um</text><text start="1829.44" dur="4.8">and then you know the merge coming up</text><text start="1831.36" dur="4.559">those those are all projects that i&apos;m</text><text start="1834.24" dur="4.48">involved with or associated with in some</text><text start="1835.919" dur="5.041">way um and the cool thing is like</text><text start="1838.72" dur="4.48">i guess to wrap up</text><text start="1840.96" dur="4.0">my my degree wasn&apos;t completely useless</text><text start="1843.2" dur="3.599">so what you learn in school with</text><text start="1844.96" dur="3.439">architecture is</text><text start="1846.799" dur="4.24">how to design and how to engage with</text><text start="1848.399" dur="3.921">systems and really if you if you step</text><text start="1851.039" dur="3.52">back and squint hard enough like</text><text start="1852.32" dur="5.68">everything is just systems and networks</text><text start="1854.559" dur="4.401">of value and actors you know</text><text start="1858.0" dur="3.039">um</text><text start="1858.96" dur="4.0">interacting with each other and so you</text><text start="1861.039" dur="5.841">know a design system</text><text start="1862.96" dur="5.839">for uh a building or a design system for</text><text start="1866.88" dur="3.279">um</text><text start="1868.799" dur="3.6">a space</text><text start="1870.159" dur="3.52">you can if you if you generalize it</text><text start="1872.399" dur="2.88">enough you can start to think about how</text><text start="1873.679" dur="4.641">these things are systems</text><text start="1875.279" dur="4.88">um and that&apos;s been like uh amazingly</text><text start="1878.32" dur="3.52">beneficial for me because i have this</text><text start="1880.159" dur="3.36">context about you know</text><text start="1881.84" dur="3.679">how do these different</text><text start="1883.519" dur="5.52">client teams interact or</text><text start="1885.519" dur="4.4">how does the core protocol you know</text><text start="1889.039" dur="4.24">uh</text><text start="1889.919" dur="5.681">how does it take up space as an entity</text><text start="1893.279" dur="4.561">or an infrastructure system and how does</text><text start="1895.6" dur="4.079">it need to be maintained um not saying</text><text start="1897.84" dur="3.52">i&apos;m an expert but at least it&apos;s been</text><text start="1899.679" dur="3.84">nice to realize like oh i actually do</text><text start="1901.36" dur="5.28">have some context on these things um so</text><text start="1903.519" dur="5.441">if there&apos;s any architects or</text><text start="1906.64" dur="4.0">urban designers listening to this uh and</text><text start="1908.96" dur="3.04">you&apos;re like</text><text start="1910.64" dur="3.84">wondering how you can get more involved</text><text start="1912.0" dur="3.519">there&apos;s there&apos;s always a way um okay</text><text start="1914.48" dur="3.039">yeah</text><text start="1915.519" dur="3.361">yeah that&apos;s great i mean you know as</text><text start="1917.519" dur="3.361">you&apos;re speaking and talking about your</text><text start="1918.88" dur="4.639">architecture degree i was reminded of</text><text start="1920.88" dur="4.399">reminded of this famous essay by eric</text><text start="1923.519" dur="4.16">raymond called the cathedral in the</text><text start="1925.279" dur="4.321">bazaar which is all about architecting</text><text start="1927.679" dur="3.281">systems in an open source environment</text><text start="1929.6" dur="3.52">and of course the cathedral is this</text><text start="1930.96" dur="4.4">top-down beautiful ornate thing that&apos;s</text><text start="1933.12" dur="3.439">built uh with god&apos;s eye view of the</text><text start="1935.36" dur="3.199">whole project and then you&apos;ve got the</text><text start="1936.559" dur="4.081">bizarre which is this bubbling brook of</text><text start="1938.559" dur="4.401">different competing priorities and</text><text start="1940.64" dur="4.08">incentives and to me it always felt like</text><text start="1942.96" dur="4.559">the ethereum ecosystem is kind of more</text><text start="1944.72" dur="5.679">of a bizarre and i&apos;m wondering if you&apos;re</text><text start="1947.519" dur="4.561">if the the role that you&apos;re playing</text><text start="1950.399" dur="3.681">with the protocol guild and all the</text><text start="1952.08" dur="4.0">stuff you&apos;ve done with beacon book and</text><text start="1954.08" dur="3.839">as an ecosystem person at the ethereum</text><text start="1956.08" dur="4.64">foundation is kind of bringing a little</text><text start="1957.919" dur="6.081">bit of structure to that bizarre do you</text><text start="1960.72" dur="5.199">look at it that in that lens in any way</text><text start="1964.0" dur="3.279">yeah yeah and you just reminded me like</text><text start="1965.919" dur="3.281">uh i mean first of all that&apos;s that&apos;s a</text><text start="1967.279" dur="3.28">great essay and like it&apos;s almost a meme</text><text start="1969.2" dur="3.76">at this point like the</text><text start="1970.559" dur="4.081">ether ethereum people love referencing</text><text start="1972.96" dur="4.88">the cathedral in the bazaar almost your</text><text start="1974.64" dur="4.72">fault but yeah whatever i&apos;m guilty um</text><text start="1977.84" dur="3.199">but yeah you just reminded me of like</text><text start="1979.36" dur="4.08">again that the tie into systems and</text><text start="1981.039" dur="4.801">architecture and this this top down</text><text start="1983.44" dur="4.64">um</text><text start="1985.84" dur="5.439">the top-down mentality and one thing</text><text start="1988.08" dur="4.64">that comes to mind is uh</text><text start="1991.279" dur="3.841">i don&apos;t remember which year maybe a</text><text start="1992.72" dur="4.079">couple decades ago or in the 70s</text><text start="1995.12" dur="3.36">i&apos;m not going to guess a date but you</text><text start="1996.799" dur="4.401">know</text><text start="1998.48" dur="5.039">brasilia is an example of this top-down</text><text start="2001.2" dur="4.319">planning that uh</text><text start="2003.519" dur="4.081">is is very much linked to</text><text start="2005.519" dur="2.88">um cathedral in the bazaar like it was</text><text start="2007.6" dur="3.439">this</text><text start="2008.399" dur="5.28">uh in brazil they came up with this this</text><text start="2011.039" dur="5.441">modernist plan for like the perfect city</text><text start="2013.679" dur="4.081">um like big name architects involved and</text><text start="2016.48" dur="3.039">designers and they&apos;re like okay we&apos;re</text><text start="2017.76" dur="3.68">going to design this and then</text><text start="2019.519" dur="5.28">i mean in retrospect in the middle of</text><text start="2021.44" dur="5.52">nowhere uh completely according to these</text><text start="2024.799" dur="4.72">abstract principles of what the ideal</text><text start="2026.96" dur="4.0">city should be and it just ended up</text><text start="2029.519" dur="3.921">completely failing like it&apos;s just a</text><text start="2030.96" dur="5.92">governor uh like a city for governance</text><text start="2033.44" dur="5.04">but it&apos;s not a city for a living um</text><text start="2036.88" dur="3.919">and like generally in the field of urban</text><text start="2038.48" dur="4.24">design whenever you have</text><text start="2040.799" dur="3.76">something that&apos;s imposed from the top</text><text start="2042.72" dur="3.679">down you end up with</text><text start="2044.559" dur="4.56">categorically like the shittiest</text><text start="2046.399" dur="3.76">solution uh because people aren&apos;t you</text><text start="2049.119" dur="2.24">know they&apos;re not talking to the people</text><text start="2050.159" dur="3.44">that are using the product they&apos;re not</text><text start="2051.359" dur="4.961">talking to the people that are uh gonna</text><text start="2053.599" dur="5.121">be changing and modifying the the</text><text start="2056.32" dur="4.72">outcome or whatever the intended plan is</text><text start="2058.72" dur="3.679">it has to take into consideration</text><text start="2061.04" dur="2.639">um</text><text start="2062.399" dur="2.881">how people are going to use these things</text><text start="2063.679" dur="3.601">so yeah cathedral in the bazaar is a</text><text start="2065.28" dur="5.599">great way to encapsulate like all of</text><text start="2067.28" dur="3.599">that and ethereum is again like</text><text start="2070.96" dur="3.76">you want the</text><text start="2073.04" dur="4.319">a ton of different complementary</text><text start="2074.72" dur="4.48">solutions to emerge and interact with</text><text start="2077.359" dur="4.641">each other and you know you have this</text><text start="2079.2" dur="5.52">evolutionary process where</text><text start="2082.0" dur="4.879">they learn from each other and uh they</text><text start="2084.72" dur="4.08">end up improving the design of each</text><text start="2086.879" dur="4.561">other through this mutual exchange of</text><text start="2088.8" dur="5.039">like failures and successes</text><text start="2091.44" dur="3.76">definitely</text><text start="2093.839" dur="2.961">yeah another analogy i&apos;m sort of</text><text start="2095.2" dur="3.6">reminded of is there was an andreessen</text><text start="2096.8" dur="3.84">horowitz video that went around a couple</text><text start="2098.8" dur="3.84">years ago about how blockchain networks</text><text start="2100.64" dur="3.6">are kind of like cities in that you have</text><text start="2102.64" dur="3.36">a group of people who have</text><text start="2104.24" dur="4.08">gathered around a resource in the</text><text start="2106.0" dur="4.16">context of a city it might be a river or</text><text start="2108.32" dur="4.24">a trade route or something and then in</text><text start="2110.16" dur="4.8">the context of the protocol it&apos;s the</text><text start="2112.56" dur="4.799">ether the asset and what you can do with</text><text start="2114.96" dur="4.159">that asset and you know i i&apos;m just</text><text start="2117.359" dur="3.841">wondering how much there is that</text><text start="2119.119" dur="4.801">transferability between your architect</text><text start="2121.2" dur="5.52">and your systems thinking to from</text><text start="2123.92" dur="5.679">digital cities to physical cities in in</text><text start="2126.72" dur="4.24">in back again but uh you know hopefully</text><text start="2129.599" dur="3.281">we&apos;ll inspire more architects and</text><text start="2130.96" dur="5.44">engineers to be entering the web 3 space</text><text start="2132.88" dur="5.04">as is uh via the protocol guild</text><text start="2136.4" dur="3.76">definitely yeah</text><text start="2137.92" dur="3.919">if anybody is curious or like wants to</text><text start="2140.16" dur="4.56">understand my journey i&apos;m happy to talk</text><text start="2141.839" dur="5.041">hit me with the dm and thank 87. right</text><text start="2144.72" dur="4.24">uh was there anything i didn&apos;t ask that</text><text start="2146.88" dur="3.76">you want to talk about with respect to</text><text start="2148.96" dur="4.72">anything within the ethereum ecosystem</text><text start="2150.64" dur="5.6">but especially protocol guild</text><text start="2153.68" dur="2.56">um</text><text start="2157.04" dur="4.559">no i think we covered most of it uh yeah</text><text start="2159.92" dur="4.56">general overview of the project oh i</text><text start="2161.599" dur="4.48">guess um yeah i will touch on so i</text><text start="2164.48" dur="3.28">mentioned where we&apos;re running this pilot</text><text start="2166.079" dur="3.681">and so we&apos;re in the</text><text start="2167.76" dur="3.92">um we&apos;re in the fundraising stage for</text><text start="2169.76" dur="2.96">this and we&apos;ve got you know some</text><text start="2171.68" dur="2.72">commitments from people who are</text><text start="2172.72" dur="3.76">interested in participating</text><text start="2174.4" dur="4.56">uh i guess i&apos;ll stress like this is an</text><text start="2176.48" dur="4.32">experiment we</text><text start="2178.96" dur="4.72">we are interested in finding out the</text><text start="2180.8" dur="4.64">ways that this is gonna</text><text start="2183.68" dur="3.28">be successful in the ways where it needs</text><text start="2185.44" dur="3.44">to be improved so if you&apos;re interested</text><text start="2186.96" dur="4.879">in being part of that one year pilot you</text><text start="2188.88" dur="4.959">know which the pilot being any funds</text><text start="2191.839" dur="4.081">that are donated will vest for a year</text><text start="2193.839" dur="4.321">and the membership can claim it at any</text><text start="2195.92" dur="2.24">point</text><text start="2198.24" dur="4.24">we want to we want to accommodate people</text><text start="2201.119" dur="3.761">who are interested in participating</text><text start="2202.48" dur="4.72">participating in this so uh reach out</text><text start="2204.88" dur="3.12">let me know um</text><text start="2207.2" dur="2.08">you know</text><text start="2208.0" dur="3.2">how you think you can be helpful we&apos;re</text><text start="2209.28" dur="3.44">also just generally for</text><text start="2211.2" dur="4.32">uh</text><text start="2212.72" dur="4.96">looking for people to just ask questions</text><text start="2215.52" dur="3.04">um there&apos;s a long section in the docs</text><text start="2217.68" dur="3.6">called</text><text start="2218.56" dur="5.039">i think uh anticipated concerns where</text><text start="2221.28" dur="4.88">like in the process of writing up all</text><text start="2223.599" dur="4.641">this documentation and trying to</text><text start="2226.16" dur="4.64">scaffold what we think is the ideal</text><text start="2228.24" dur="5.119">mechanism uh you know people have</text><text start="2230.8" dur="4.4">brought up concerns i&apos;ve thought of some</text><text start="2233.359" dur="5.201">and so it&apos;s this long list of things of</text><text start="2235.2" dur="5.2">like how can this go wrong and if you</text><text start="2238.56" dur="4.64">think you found one i&apos;d love to hear</text><text start="2240.4" dur="3.76">from you um again the only way this is</text><text start="2243.2" dur="2.32">gonna</text><text start="2244.16" dur="3.76">if it&apos;s gonna be successful long term</text><text start="2245.52" dur="5.2">it&apos;s gonna have a ton of eyes on it and</text><text start="2247.92" dur="4.48">people helping to improve it so uh the</text><text start="2250.72" dur="3.76">two yeah if you&apos;re interested in</text><text start="2252.4" dur="5.52">sponsoring please reach out if you if</text><text start="2254.48" dur="5.28">just a community member and you want to</text><text start="2257.92" dur="3.76">you know help</text><text start="2259.76" dur="3.52">broadcast this get awareness for it or</text><text start="2261.68" dur="3.76">improve the mechanism i&apos;m also happy to</text><text start="2263.28" dur="3.76">talk i&apos;ll answer any questions</text><text start="2265.44" dur="3.04">yeah i just want to say you know from</text><text start="2267.04" dur="3.6">watching your selling point talk i was</text><text start="2268.48" dur="3.92">really kind of deeply impressed that you</text><text start="2270.64" dur="3.199">spent maybe five minutes on stage</text><text start="2272.4" dur="2.88">talking about the ways that it can go</text><text start="2273.839" dur="2.961">wrong and how you&apos;ve worked through</text><text start="2275.28" dur="3.12">those things there&apos;s not a lot of people</text><text start="2276.8" dur="2.559">that will be that open and just that</text><text start="2278.4" dur="2.48">thoughtful</text><text start="2279.359" dur="3.201">about it but i guess you know now</text><text start="2280.88" dur="3.6">knowing that you used to learn about</text><text start="2282.56" dur="3.519">architecting buildings maybe you&apos;re used</text><text start="2284.48" dur="3.52">to doing a lot of that upfront planning</text><text start="2286.079" dur="3.441">and in that that thinking so i think</text><text start="2288.0" dur="3.92">that&apos;s cool</text><text start="2289.52" dur="4.16">yeah for sure maybe maybe it comes from</text><text start="2291.92" dur="3.12">uh</text><text start="2293.68" dur="3.28">it&apos;s a good point maybe it comes from an</text><text start="2295.04" dur="3.2">ego bit of like i want to cover my ass</text><text start="2296.96" dur="3.2">in case something does go wrong and i</text><text start="2298.24" dur="4.08">can point you and be like well actually</text><text start="2300.16" dur="4.4">i wrote about it but uh</text><text start="2302.32" dur="3.279">no i think the only only good things can</text><text start="2304.56" dur="3.76">come from</text><text start="2305.599" dur="3.681">uh writing about like failure scenarios</text><text start="2308.32" dur="3.2">and</text><text start="2309.28" dur="3.44">um the ways things can get gamed and</text><text start="2311.52" dur="2.8">that&apos;s actually one of the things i&apos;ll</text><text start="2312.72" dur="3.44">mention is like</text><text start="2314.32" dur="3.84">trying to figure out like okay what&apos;s</text><text start="2316.16" dur="3.6">the waiting for this thing how do we</text><text start="2318.16" dur="3.6">determine waiting</text><text start="2319.76" dur="3.76">and</text><text start="2321.76" dur="3.44">instead of like actually figuring out a</text><text start="2323.52" dur="3.28">waiting system we&apos;ve realized that it&apos;s</text><text start="2325.2" dur="3.84">probably best to</text><text start="2326.8" dur="4.4">start with the simplest least gameable</text><text start="2329.04" dur="4.16">thing possible like if you were to take</text><text start="2331.2" dur="3.04">a new account something on github or</text><text start="2333.2" dur="3.04">like</text><text start="2334.24" dur="3.92">peers rating each other</text><text start="2336.24" dur="4.72">that has to be done very delicately and</text><text start="2338.16" dur="4.48">you don&apos;t want to um</text><text start="2340.96" dur="3.44">end up crashing the mechanism before it</text><text start="2342.64" dur="3.84">even starts so the waiting mechanism is</text><text start="2344.4" dur="3.199">simply uh</text><text start="2346.48" dur="2.24">it&apos;s just</text><text start="2347.599" dur="3.281">the the amount of time you&apos;ve been</text><text start="2348.72" dur="3.84">contributing so i think it&apos;ll get</text><text start="2350.88" dur="4.4">entered in the split as like the number</text><text start="2352.56" dur="4.72">of months you&apos;ve been active um</text><text start="2355.28" dur="4.4">so there&apos;s no need for like</text><text start="2357.28" dur="3.68">waiting in terms of</text><text start="2359.68" dur="2.72">how do you feel about this person and</text><text start="2360.96" dur="4.72">their contributions maybe we&apos;ll get</text><text start="2362.4" dur="5.52">there someday but you know start</text><text start="2365.68" dur="4.32">we want to start the
