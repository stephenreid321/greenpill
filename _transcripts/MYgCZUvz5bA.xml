Matt</text><text start="19.74" dur="3.78">maybe let&apos;s start with you</text><text start="21.6" dur="3.48">sure thing I guess before I kick it off</text><text start="23.52" dur="3.24">um I also want to kind of give a shout</text><text start="25.08" dur="3.539">out to a few team members who&apos;ve helped</text><text start="26.76" dur="3.3">shape the thinking here um Evan miazono</text><text start="28.619" dur="3.06">who I think you&apos;ve already had on the</text><text start="30.06" dur="3.12">green pill podcast and then hulka</text><text start="31.679" dur="2.821">Brammer who has been kind of</text><text start="33.18" dur="2.879">instrumental in shaping our thinking</text><text start="34.5" dur="3.059">here and uh hopefully he has a chance to</text><text start="36.059" dur="3.061">kind of voice his unique perspective as</text><text start="37.559" dur="4.081">well</text><text start="39.12" dur="4.86">um just to answer your question I would</text><text start="41.64" dur="4.86">start with more or less our high level</text><text start="43.98" dur="3.66">thinking um on you know what needs to</text><text start="46.5" dur="2.64">exist</text><text start="47.64" dur="3.78">we&apos;re like what the world needs to look</text><text start="49.14" dur="3.48">like for us to have sufficient Capital</text><text start="51.42" dur="3.119">to kind of like create like an</text><text start="52.62" dur="4.32">investable or like a you know</text><text start="54.539" dur="4.5">sustainably sustainably fundable um</text><text start="56.94" dur="3.66">impact market and I think</text><text start="59.039" dur="3.241">for us it&apos;s like breaking it down into</text><text start="60.6" dur="4.44">okay I think one of the most important</text><text start="62.28" dur="4.26">things is like you need a pool of value</text><text start="65.04" dur="3.36">aligned Capital</text><text start="66.54" dur="3.54">um at one end of the spectrum that is</text><text start="68.4" dur="3.36">really kind of like funding in multiple</text><text start="70.08" dur="3.6">ways that create the right incentive</text><text start="71.76" dur="4.08">systems um to actually like create the</text><text start="73.68" dur="4.14">useful work that&apos;s being done and this</text><text start="75.84" dur="3.48">pool of capital needs to have</text><text start="77.82" dur="2.82">you know in the Subway&apos;s aligned</text><text start="79.32" dur="2.939">incentives to be able to kind of like</text><text start="80.64" dur="2.64">fund this it needs to be sustainable in</text><text start="82.259" dur="2.761">the sense that we can continue to</text><text start="83.28" dur="3.659">reinvest and that we actually have like</text><text start="85.02" dur="3.36">a you know an ability to fund over a</text><text start="86.939" dur="2.881">long time a lot of these projects that</text><text start="88.38" dur="4.919">are going to take many years to kind of</text><text start="89.82" dur="4.799">like become coherent and then also that</text><text start="93.299" dur="3.241">kind of implies</text><text start="94.619" dur="4.441">um some measure of kind of value capture</text><text start="96.54" dur="4.2">or value kind of like replenishment um</text><text start="99.06" dur="3.84">so that you can kind of you know refill</text><text start="100.74" dur="3.9">the pots of resources funding money</text><text start="102.9" dur="3.06">whatever you want to call it in order to</text><text start="104.64" dur="3.24">continue like funding these things and</text><text start="105.96" dur="4.82">create that electronic pathway</text><text start="107.88" dur="6.12">on the other end you need a supply of</text><text start="110.78" dur="5.199">projects people organizations that are</text><text start="114.0" dur="3.479">really allocating the resources that are</text><text start="115.979" dur="3.061">available towards some of these kind of</text><text start="117.479" dur="3.96">like important you know regen projects</text><text start="119.04" dur="4.38">that we call you know examples of Open</text><text start="121.439" dur="3.36">Source software a lot of the great work</text><text start="123.42" dur="3.0">that&apos;s being done in kind of like you</text><text start="124.799" dur="4.32">know Carbon offsets</text><text start="126.42" dur="4.74">um you know things like journalism</text><text start="129.119" dur="3.961">um I think there&apos;s a lot of like there&apos;s</text><text start="131.16" dur="3.42">a need for more teams and like more</text><text start="133.08" dur="3.06">having the smartest people of our time</text><text start="134.58" dur="3.78">and like the most capable driven teams</text><text start="136.14" dur="3.959">working on these projects but for that</text><text start="138.36" dur="3.48">to exist you almost need capital and</text><text start="140.099" dur="3.481">resources to be allocated from these</text><text start="141.84" dur="4.619">pool of capitals or the pool Capital</text><text start="143.58" dur="4.98">pool resources and find the right teams</text><text start="146.459" dur="4.741">so that is productively allocating these</text><text start="148.56" dur="4.08">resources to get the work done and for</text><text start="151.2" dur="3.6">that I think there&apos;s this middle piece</text><text start="152.64" dur="4.38">that in my mind is one of the most</text><text start="154.8" dur="4.019">interesting Parts which is how do you</text><text start="157.02" dur="3.299">get resources from A to B and how do you</text><text start="158.819" dur="3.301">solve like the reason the distribution</text><text start="160.319" dur="4.381">infrastructure of being able to properly</text><text start="162.12" dur="5.46">set up how funding gets from these pools</text><text start="164.7" dur="4.92">of funding to the projects in a basic in</text><text start="167.58" dur="4.439">a way that actually allows them to kind</text><text start="169.62" dur="4.259">of like grow test ideas and sustainably</text><text start="172.019" dur="4.141">fund the ideas they&apos;re working on and I</text><text start="173.879" dur="4.08">think that&apos;s a really interesting part</text><text start="176.16" dur="3.299">to explore especially with some of the</text><text start="177.959" dur="4.021">latest work that&apos;s happening in kind of</text><text start="179.459" dur="3.901">like the regen space where I think we&apos;re</text><text start="181.98" dur="4.619">starting to develop a lot more of the</text><text start="183.36" dur="5.28">tools to create that allocation from</text><text start="186.599" dur="3.481">these pools to Capital all the way to</text><text start="188.64" dur="3.66">the people who are doing and more and</text><text start="190.08" dur="4.079">more often seeing the incentives aligned</text><text start="192.3" dur="3.96">for them to create large-scale impact</text><text start="194.159" dur="3.541">projects that align kind of like the</text><text start="196.26" dur="3.3">work and the resources that we have in</text><text start="197.7" dur="3.899">our economy towards the most important</text><text start="199.56" dur="3.66">things in people&apos;s lives that are maybe</text><text start="201.599" dur="4.86">underfunded right now</text><text start="203.22" dur="5.099">so I&apos;ll stop there I&apos;m curious about of</text><text start="206.459" dur="3.0">your perspective here Lee as well and uh</text><text start="208.319" dur="3.481">and Kevin</text><text start="209.459" dur="4.081">yeah same question to you Lee uh what</text><text start="211.8" dur="5.159">would have to be true to connect more</text><text start="213.54" dur="5.1">money to more more impact</text><text start="216.959" dur="3.901">yeah for sure</text><text start="218.64" dur="4.679">um first of all I would just like to say</text><text start="220.86" dur="5.7">that I&apos;m probably like the most Noob</text><text start="223.319" dur="5.521">person on this podcast in so far as you</text><text start="226.56" dur="3.48">know this is not where I spend like my</text><text start="228.84" dur="4.14">full-time</text><text start="230.04" dur="4.44">um day job thinking about but this is an</text><text start="232.98" dur="3.539">area</text><text start="234.48" dur="4.56">um of inquiry that definitely</text><text start="236.519" dur="4.921">tremendously interests me and I think is</text><text start="239.04" dur="3.119">super critically important</text><text start="241.44" dur="2.939">um</text><text start="242.159" dur="3.781">I think in terms of the question of like</text><text start="244.379" dur="3.901">what would what would need to be true to</text><text start="245.94" dur="4.019">make impact investable I think it&apos;s</text><text start="248.28" dur="4.8">helpful to start with impact investing</text><text start="249.959" dur="4.681">outside of crypto and examine that</text><text start="253.08" dur="3.18">market as a whole in the funding</text><text start="254.64" dur="3.779">landscape around it</text><text start="256.26" dur="4.5">um so impact investing is this sector of</text><text start="258.419" dur="4.621">investing where</text><text start="260.76" dur="5.82">um investors are seeking to generate a</text><text start="263.04" dur="6.06">positive social or environmental impact</text><text start="266.58" dur="5.399">in addition to just Financial returns</text><text start="269.1" dur="5.099">which is you know the classic type of</text><text start="271.979" dur="4.5">investing that we have and which most</text><text start="274.199" dur="6.0">capital capital allocators are seeking</text><text start="276.479" dur="6.901">to maximize and so that idea of having</text><text start="280.199" dur="4.381">these like dual or three separate</text><text start="283.38" dur="3.78">mandates</text><text start="284.58" dur="4.32">um like Beyond just Financial profit</text><text start="287.16" dur="4.38">maximization but actually seeking to</text><text start="288.9" dur="4.92">generate impacts outside of that I think</text><text start="291.54" dur="3.96">that gets to the Crux of like what needs</text><text start="293.82" dur="3.24">to be the case for impact to be</text><text start="295.5" dur="5.34">investable</text><text start="297.06" dur="6.18">um traditionally like in the investing</text><text start="300.84" dur="4.5">world most capital is seeking to</text><text start="303.24" dur="4.38">generate profits like that is the motive</text><text start="305.34" dur="4.68">that is motivating most capital</text><text start="307.62" dur="4.98">allocators and so I think in order to</text><text start="310.02" dur="5.16">make impact investing or to make this</text><text start="312.6" dur="4.2">style of investing more attractive more</text><text start="315.18" dur="4.739">investable what needs to happen is that</text><text start="316.8" dur="5.22">that impact needs to be bundled in with</text><text start="319.919" dur="4.56">the financial impact or like with the</text><text start="322.02" dur="3.679">primary kpi against which we are</text><text start="324.479" dur="6.241">assessing</text><text start="325.699" dur="7.121">companies or projects I think to uh to</text><text start="330.72" dur="4.02">Matt&apos;s point about like the efficient</text><text start="332.82" dur="4.14">market hypothesis I think one one</text><text start="334.74" dur="5.22">critical missing piece</text><text start="336.96" dur="5.88">um in the world today is that there&apos;s</text><text start="339.96" dur="4.739">market failures all around us markets</text><text start="342.84" dur="2.88">are not efficient there&apos;s many instances</text><text start="344.699" dur="3.72">where</text><text start="345.72" dur="5.52">supply and demand are not clearing at an</text><text start="348.419" dur="5.34">optimal point from a societally optimal</text><text start="351.24" dur="4.56">perspective and those sources of market</text><text start="353.759" dur="4.88">failure can include</text><text start="355.8" dur="4.739">externalities that are not internalized</text><text start="358.639" dur="3.4">disproportionate Market power on the</text><text start="360.539" dur="4.861">part of you know certain Market</text><text start="362.039" dur="5.041">participants information is asymmetry</text><text start="365.4" dur="5.28">Etc there&apos;s lots of different reasons</text><text start="367.08" dur="7.44">why markets would fail and I think</text><text start="370.68" dur="6.54">like the idea of impact being this</text><text start="374.52" dur="4.619">separate thing from a financial motive</text><text start="377.22" dur="3.919">is is the reason why we don&apos;t have more</text><text start="379.139" dur="4.56">impact investing today it&apos;s because</text><text start="381.139" dur="5.981">impact is a separate kpi versus</text><text start="383.699" dur="6.661">Financial outcomes which is the the very</text><text start="387.12" dur="5.94">clearly measurable outcome and so if we</text><text start="390.36" dur="4.92">can somehow tie together impact into the</text><text start="393.06" dur="4.74">financial metrics and optimize for that</text><text start="395.28" dur="4.8">one single kpi</text><text start="397.8" dur="4.56">um then I think that is the world in</text><text start="400.08" dur="3.839">which we can optimize for these social</text><text start="402.36" dur="4.38">impacts</text><text start="403.919" dur="4.981">um as a part of what we do every day</text><text start="406.74" dur="3.66">Matt did you want to respond to that I</text><text start="408.9" dur="3.66">agree and I think it&apos;s</text><text start="410.4" dur="3.72">so I think I&apos;d maybe like try and you</text><text start="412.56" dur="4.139">know pull apart a little a few threads</text><text start="414.12" dur="4.62">there about you know maybe like one what</text><text start="416.699" dur="3.72">does being investable mean and then two</text><text start="418.74" dur="3.239">what do we Define as impact and like</text><text start="420.419" dur="3.06">start not to be too abstract I think</text><text start="421.979" dur="2.22">it&apos;s it&apos;s helpful to frame that in terms</text><text start="423.479" dur="2.401">of</text><text start="424.199" dur="2.881">you know like investable can mean</text><text start="425.88" dur="3.12">different things to different kind of</text><text start="427.08" dur="3.899">like bodies and I think it&apos;s really like</text><text start="429.0" dur="3.36">you know where do I see a return</text><text start="430.979" dur="2.701">um by the resources that I&apos;m putting out</text><text start="432.36" dur="3.42">and I think you can look at that at a</text><text start="433.68" dur="3.84">few different layers like it&apos;s you know</text><text start="435.78" dur="3.419">from um potentially more of like an</text><text start="437.52" dur="3.84">investment Focus perspective</text><text start="439.199" dur="3.601">um and you know leap feel free to</text><text start="441.36" dur="2.88">challenge me on this but um there&apos;s kind</text><text start="442.8" dur="2.88">of like you know the VC mindset where</text><text start="444.24" dur="3.72">there&apos;s a certain kind of return profile</text><text start="445.68" dur="3.84">or kind of expectations when you are</text><text start="447.96" dur="3.179">making an investment in the thesis</text><text start="449.52" dur="3.239">behind that and then I would maybe draw</text><text start="451.139" dur="3.361">the corollary to something more so like</text><text start="452.759" dur="3.0">Government funding where it&apos;s you have a</text><text start="454.5" dur="3.24">value capture umbrella that is</text><text start="455.759" dur="3.84">essentially kind of like you know is in</text><text start="457.74" dur="3.239">its perfect State optimizing for kind of</text><text start="459.599" dur="3.421">like the value or the kind of like</text><text start="460.979" dur="3.961">continuance of society and like the the</text><text start="463.02" dur="3.42">generation of kind of like value for</text><text start="464.94" dur="3.0">that entire kind of like nation state</text><text start="466.44" dur="2.94">for example and then you can think of</text><text start="467.94" dur="2.58">other things like Dows or you know other</text><text start="469.38" dur="3.18">funding entities that might have</text><text start="470.52" dur="3.36">different kind of return prop profiles</text><text start="472.56" dur="3.0">um you know think of like nonprofits</text><text start="473.88" dur="2.939">stuff like that so really when that you</text><text start="475.56" dur="2.639">know always investing maybe it&apos;s good to</text><text start="476.819" dur="3.841">open it up to like there are different</text><text start="478.199" dur="4.141">kind of motivations behind investing and</text><text start="480.66" dur="3.479">like the pool of capital and the</text><text start="482.34" dur="3.12">projects need to kind of match in this</text><text start="484.139" dur="3.661">sense of like they need to have the</text><text start="485.46" dur="3.54">profile of return and value that is</text><text start="487.8" dur="3.66">appropriate for the funder that is</text><text start="489.0" dur="4.199">actually funding them and I think that</text><text start="491.46" dur="3.6">opens up a lot of interesting you know</text><text start="493.199" dur="3.541">exploration about what type of entities</text><text start="495.06" dur="2.88">need to exist to be able to fund the</text><text start="496.74" dur="3.12">types of projects that we think are</text><text start="497.94" dur="3.9">underfunded the second thing I would say</text><text start="499.86" dur="4.38">with impact is like maybe one way to</text><text start="501.84" dur="4.259">think of that is in the term of like um</text><text start="504.24" dur="4.56">externalities you know positive and</text><text start="506.099" dur="3.901">negative and whether or not you know</text><text start="508.8" dur="3.119">something is kind of like internalized</text><text start="510.0" dur="3.539">like the value that is created is</text><text start="511.919" dur="3.36">internalized or the value that is</text><text start="513.539" dur="2.821">created is actually an externality it&apos;s</text><text start="515.279" dur="3.421">not something that&apos;s immediately</text><text start="516.36" dur="3.96">captured by the you know the entity that</text><text start="518.7" dur="2.88">creates it but is rather kind of</text><text start="520.32" dur="3.12">externalized so when you think of</text><text start="521.58" dur="4.14">something like impact investing I would</text><text start="523.44" dur="3.72">throw a layer on of we&apos;re seeing a lot</text><text start="525.72" dur="3.96">of projects that are actually generating</text><text start="527.16" dur="4.08">a lot of like positive externalities but</text><text start="529.68" dur="3.0">don&apos;t necessarily capture that in a way</text><text start="531.24" dur="3.96">that would be returnable in existing</text><text start="532.68" dur="3.659">funding models so I think it&apos;s like it&apos;s</text><text start="535.2" dur="2.16">a helpful friend of like you know impact</text><text start="536.339" dur="2.401">can mean a lot of different things to</text><text start="537.36" dur="2.76">different people but right now it&apos;s like</text><text start="538.74" dur="2.76">well we see a lot of externalities that</text><text start="540.12" dur="3.24">are created but aren&apos;t necessarily</text><text start="541.5" dur="4.8">captured by the existing kind of you</text><text start="543.36" dur="4.14">know Capital markets capitalist system</text><text start="546.3" dur="2.4">um and maybe that&apos;s something that we</text><text start="547.5" dur="2.459">can actually kind of change and improve</text><text start="548.7" dur="3.6">which we have started to see with things</text><text start="549.959" dur="4.5">like ESG despite you know arguments</text><text start="552.3" dur="3.78">against it</text><text start="554.459" dur="4.081">yeah I think those are really really</text><text start="556.08" dur="4.62">great points I think specifically honing</text><text start="558.54" dur="4.02">in on this idea of like what do we even</text><text start="560.7" dur="3.18">mean by impact</text><text start="562.56" dur="3.18">um like there&apos;s lots of different types</text><text start="563.88" dur="3.42">of impact I think that is a really</text><text start="565.74" dur="3.18">Salient Point</text><text start="567.3" dur="5.159">um and I would point to the fact that</text><text start="568.92" dur="5.52">you know just that in recent decades</text><text start="572.459" dur="4.82">um there are now so many companies that</text><text start="574.44" dur="6.12">are voluntarily offsetting their carbon</text><text start="577.279" dur="5.021">emissions as being you know a type of</text><text start="580.56" dur="4.56">impact investing that these corporations</text><text start="582.3" dur="5.7">are doing like they are now</text><text start="585.12" dur="4.92">um cognizant of this type of impact that</text><text start="588.0" dur="4.14">they have on the environment in addition</text><text start="590.04" dur="6.12">to the financial returns that they&apos;re</text><text start="592.14" dur="6.78">delivering and so that that second like</text><text start="596.16" dur="4.679">um you know source of like that second</text><text start="598.92" dur="4.68">mandate that goes above and beyond the</text><text start="600.839" dur="5.701">financial outcomes that they produce is</text><text start="603.6" dur="5.4">a really interesting shift</text><text start="606.54" dur="4.32">um and I think there&apos;s a lot of we could</text><text start="609.0" dur="3.72">you know maybe explore like the reasons</text><text start="610.86" dur="3.419">why that shifted and think about how</text><text start="612.72" dur="3.9">that could apply to other types of</text><text start="614.279" dur="4.801">impact as well but I think that is like</text><text start="616.62" dur="4.74">a really interesting microcosm of how do</text><text start="619.08" dur="4.56">we move the world in a direction wherein</text><text start="621.36" dur="5.46">players have</text><text start="623.64" dur="6.18">um a desire to care about more than just</text><text start="626.82" dur="5.82">Financial returns</text><text start="629.82" dur="4.079">yeah I&apos;d be I&apos;d love to like dive into</text><text start="632.64" dur="2.879">that one a little bit understand your</text><text start="633.899" dur="2.821">perspective as somebody who&apos;s coming</text><text start="635.519" dur="2.88">from</text><text start="636.72" dur="5.16">you know dare I say the VC perspective</text><text start="638.399" dur="5.161">as well I I also am curious because</text><text start="641.88" dur="3.66">you know I think when you think of this</text><text start="643.56" dur="4.68">idea and maybe I&apos;ll layer on another</text><text start="645.54" dur="4.08">um you know pitch over over to you is</text><text start="648.24" dur="3.719">when we think of a lot of kind of public</text><text start="649.62" dur="3.54">goods funding there&apos;s you know one way</text><text start="651.959" dur="3.06">of saying that is like there&apos;s massive</text><text start="653.16" dur="4.2">government and entities and ngos who</text><text start="655.019" dur="3.901">represent the big pool of capital that&apos;s</text><text start="657.36" dur="4.38">um you know they do invest in some</text><text start="658.92" dur="4.08">elements of public goods and we can you</text><text start="661.74" dur="2.94">know I would make the assertion that</text><text start="663.0" dur="3.66">there&apos;s potentially a need for increased</text><text start="664.68" dur="3.599">efficiency or productivity of some of</text><text start="666.66" dur="3.54">like the resources that are allocated or</text><text start="668.279" dur="3.961">like currently exist in that big pool</text><text start="670.2" dur="4.5">one of them being that you know some of</text><text start="672.24" dur="4.44">these big institutions are not</text><text start="674.7" dur="3.24">you know well suited to invest in</text><text start="676.68" dur="3.24">Innovation</text><text start="677.94" dur="3.36">um you know High upside high risk which</text><text start="679.92" dur="3.479">is typically something that is really</text><text start="681.3" dur="5.219">well suited to VCS and I you know I</text><text start="683.399" dur="4.62">would argue that there&apos;s a need for in</text><text start="686.519" dur="3.841">the public goods and impact space the</text><text start="688.019" dur="4.801">ability to like massively scale and</text><text start="690.36" dur="4.8">invest and create the you know the</text><text start="692.82" dur="4.68">environment the ecosystem for these high</text><text start="695.16" dur="4.679">risk High you know High reward type</text><text start="697.5" dur="4.32">public goods and impact projects to be</text><text start="699.839" dur="4.981">able to be funded and scaled</text><text start="701.82" dur="4.38">um so I guess I&apos;ll toss over to you like</text><text start="704.82" dur="2.22">for the first point like what do you</text><text start="706.2" dur="2.28">think</text><text start="707.04" dur="3.479">um has been changing and like how have</text><text start="708.48" dur="4.08">you seen that</text><text start="710.519" dur="4.141">on from your perspective in in the VC</text><text start="712.56" dur="4.98">lens</text><text start="714.66" dur="5.22">yeah uh</text><text start="717.54" dur="6.06">I think like an efficient market person</text><text start="719.88" dur="5.88">would have a slightly like I think</text><text start="723.6" dur="3.9">there&apos;s two possible explanations as to</text><text start="725.76" dur="4.56">what&apos;s going on in the in the carbon</text><text start="727.5" dur="5.16">markets with regards to carbon offsets</text><text start="730.32" dur="4.019">and like that that cultural shift in the</text><text start="732.66" dur="4.32">way that corporations are behaving with</text><text start="734.339" dur="4.74">voluntary carbon offsets</text><text start="736.98" dur="5.4">um and so I&apos;ll I&apos;ll lay them out both</text><text start="739.079" dur="5.281">here so one explanation could be the one</text><text start="742.38" dur="3.42">that I alluded to earlier which is that</text><text start="744.36" dur="3.659">because</text><text start="745.8" dur="3.599">climate change has now become such a</text><text start="748.019" dur="4.981">major issue</text><text start="749.399" dur="5.521">um that everyone uh cares about</text><text start="753.0" dur="3.48">um and that includes like the leaders of</text><text start="754.92" dur="3.06">these companies</text><text start="756.48" dur="3.84">um as a result of that these</text><text start="757.98" dur="3.18">corporations have just adopted</text><text start="760.32" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="761.16" dur="5.82">this Mandate of offsetting carbon</text><text start="764.16" dur="6.119">emissions and so they&apos;ve like just kind</text><text start="766.98" dur="5.88">of voluntarily created uh this mission</text><text start="770.279" dur="5.401">of eliminating or offsetting a portion</text><text start="772.86" dur="4.8">of their carbon offsets fully because of</text><text start="775.68" dur="3.54">you know the desire to do so because</text><text start="777.66" dur="3.179">they believe that climate change is an</text><text start="779.22" dur="3.66">important issue and that they want to</text><text start="780.839" dur="4.321">play a part in it</text><text start="782.88" dur="4.019">um and so it could just you know that&apos;s</text><text start="785.16" dur="3.54">kind of like the intrinsic desire</text><text start="786.899" dur="3.721">argument</text><text start="788.7" dur="4.68">um and that&apos;s nice to believe because</text><text start="790.62" dur="4.14">you know maybe corporations have like</text><text start="793.38" dur="2.28">other</text><text start="794.76" dur="2.46">um</text><text start="795.66" dur="4.679">missions and motives Beyond just</text><text start="797.22" dur="5.7">Financial maximization of profits</text><text start="800.339" dur="4.081">and then I think the second explanation</text><text start="802.92" dur="4.08">um which is more of like an efficient</text><text start="804.42" dur="4.08">market explanation could be that because</text><text start="807.0" dur="3.24">climate change has become such a hot</text><text start="808.5" dur="4.019">button issue on the part of consumers</text><text start="810.24" dur="4.08">and now impacts the way that consumers</text><text start="812.519" dur="2.88">direct their dollars and spend their</text><text start="814.32" dur="3.0">money</text><text start="815.399" dur="4.141">um it impacts the brands and companies</text><text start="817.32" dur="5.22">that they choose to buy from perhaps</text><text start="819.54" dur="4.859">this is just another way of</text><text start="822.54" dur="4.62">um like that desire for profit</text><text start="824.399" dur="4.56">maximization to express itself that</text><text start="827.16" dur="4.799">ultimately by offsetting carbon</text><text start="828.959" dur="6.841">companies are actually just serving the</text><text start="831.959" dur="7.44">financial profit maximization motive and</text><text start="835.8" dur="5.88">they can do so because offset and carbon</text><text start="839.399" dur="5.341">maximizes their sales</text><text start="841.68" dur="5.399">I&apos;m not sure which one is the right</text><text start="844.74" dur="4.26">explanation maybe there&apos;s there&apos;s</text><text start="847.079" dur="3.961">probably a bit of both</text><text start="849.0" dur="4.8">um in play</text><text start="851.04" dur="4.14">but I I mean I can pause there and I I</text><text start="853.8" dur="3.62">would love to hear your guys&apos;s thoughts</text><text start="855.18" dur="2.24">as well</text><text start="857.88" dur="4.199">yeah you&apos;ve been quiet over there yeah</text><text start="860.639" dur="2.82">oh you guys are the experts let me know</text><text start="862.079" dur="3.181">when you&apos;re ready to make a meme about</text><text start="863.459" dur="3.781">this stuff and I&apos;ll chime in but uh no</text><text start="865.26" dur="3.42">it&apos;s gonna say uh I think that was the</text><text start="867.24" dur="4.62">carbon credits Market someone told me</text><text start="868.68" dur="6.68">that 99 of carbon credits are consumed</text><text start="871.86" dur="7.32">by people who have mandated yeah</text><text start="875.36" dur="5.26">versus one percent is voluntary and and</text><text start="879.18" dur="4.019">you know I&apos;m I&apos;m wondering what would</text><text start="880.62" dur="5.579">have to be true for more companies to</text><text start="883.199" dur="3.901">voluntarily consume uh carbon credits</text><text start="886.199" dur="3.961">because it feels like that&apos;s a little</text><text start="887.1" dur="4.44">bit more scalable but uh but yeah Matt</text><text start="890.16" dur="2.82">I&apos;m curious what you think of of all</text><text start="891.54" dur="3.599">this</text><text start="892.98" dur="4.32">yeah well I think I think it&apos;s a balance</text><text start="895.139" dur="3.0">and I think it&apos;s I really likely&apos;s point</text><text start="897.3" dur="2.76">about</text><text start="898.139" dur="3.481">you know I guess like the you know if I</text><text start="900.06" dur="3.24">if I put on my kind of like realist or</text><text start="901.62" dur="2.519">like the efficient market hat</text><text start="903.3" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="904.139" dur="4.801">in some ways like it&apos;s if if a company</text><text start="906.72" dur="4.14">is responding to kind of like consumer</text><text start="908.94" dur="3.48">desire to like direct their funding</text><text start="910.86" dur="4.68">based off of like a kind of like more</text><text start="912.42" dur="4.62">environmentally friendly mandate</text><text start="915.54" dur="2.46">I think it&apos;s like I don&apos;t think there&apos;s</text><text start="917.04" dur="2.94">anything wrong with that if the end</text><text start="918.0" dur="4.44">result is that people are investing more</text><text start="919.98" dur="3.84">and like doing more to kind of offset</text><text start="922.44" dur="3.899">um like your carbon impact and I think</text><text start="923.82" dur="5.879">that&apos;s in some ways that&apos;s a way of</text><text start="926.339" dur="5.881">consumers actually you know using their</text><text start="929.699" dur="3.961">buying preference to you know reflect</text><text start="932.22" dur="2.76">change that they want to see which I</text><text start="933.66" dur="2.58">think is like super powerful and can</text><text start="934.98" dur="3.0">like we can point that to a lot of</text><text start="936.24" dur="3.659">different things that are happening you</text><text start="937.98" dur="3.18">know with kind of like you know web3 in</text><text start="939.899" dur="3.601">the way that now web3 is kind of</text><text start="941.16" dur="3.78">creating Dows and um you know investment</text><text start="943.5" dur="3.899">pools to actually invest in the way that</text><text start="944.94" dur="4.259">they actually want to see and like you</text><text start="947.399" dur="3.661">know propagate their preference for for</text><text start="949.199" dur="3.301">different like value systems in in their</text><text start="951.06" dur="3.719">existing cat you know the existing</text><text start="952.5" dur="5.639">economy I think like with the regulation</text><text start="954.779" dur="4.92">piece it&apos;s like it comes back to</text><text start="958.139" dur="2.94">you know what what is the root cause of</text><text start="959.699" dur="3.361">that is it&apos;s</text><text start="961.079" dur="5.401">that could also just be like people you</text><text start="963.06" dur="5.519">know pushing through via their vote in</text><text start="966.48" dur="3.84">um you know local politics or like you</text><text start="968.579" dur="5.401">know various like Representatives that</text><text start="970.32" dur="5.759">like we want we demand more kind of</text><text start="973.98" dur="3.539">emphasis on these types of regulations</text><text start="976.079" dur="2.94">that&apos;ll facilitate that so I think like</text><text start="977.519" dur="3.12">regulation is a powerful tool if it</text><text start="979.019" dur="3.361">represents the kind of like the</text><text start="980.639" dur="3.301">intentions of the people there I don&apos;t</text><text start="982.38" dur="3.66">want to go too much into politics but I</text><text start="983.94" dur="3.18">guess what I&apos;m coming back to is like I</text><text start="986.04" dur="2.82">think it&apos;s super interesting that people</text><text start="987.12" dur="3.659">are now</text><text start="988.86" dur="3.599">you know whether assumed or like</text><text start="990.779" dur="4.021">explicitly actually kind of thinking</text><text start="992.459" dur="3.421">more about these these values aligned</text><text start="994.8" dur="3.0">kind of ways of kind of you know</text><text start="995.88" dur="3.0">spending their dollars and I guess I&apos;d</text><text start="997.8" dur="3.0">be curious</text><text start="998.88" dur="4.019">Lee if you think</text><text start="1000.8" dur="3.3">you know one on one one end is like the</text><text start="1002.899" dur="3.36">kind of like the purchase perspective</text><text start="1004.1" dur="4.739">but on like the investing perspective I</text><text start="1006.259" dur="3.961">could see another world where people who</text><text start="1008.839" dur="2.641">have are in a position where they&apos;re</text><text start="1010.22" dur="3.059">actually kind of like are able to</text><text start="1011.48" dur="4.02">reinvest their wealth um on a level of</text><text start="1013.279" dur="4.081">like an LP</text><text start="1015.5" dur="4.199">are we seeing a shift in kind of the</text><text start="1017.36" dur="4.02">preferences of kind of like a value</text><text start="1019.699" dur="3.121">attached to Capital that has</text><text start="1021.38" dur="3.12">traditionally been like more so profit</text><text start="1022.82" dur="3.54">profit focused or is it now kind of</text><text start="1024.5" dur="3.66">coming into more of like an ESG or like</text><text start="1026.36" dur="4.579">a you know it has a values aligned um</text><text start="1028.16" dur="2.779">flavor to it now</text><text start="1031.12" dur="4.54">so many thoughts here uh so first I&apos;ll</text><text start="1034.22" dur="3.359">respond to</text><text start="1035.66" dur="4.5">um I&apos;ll continue the conversation about</text><text start="1037.579" dur="4.141">carbon markets and carbon offsets first</text><text start="1040.16" dur="3.6">before answering the second part of the</text><text start="1041.72" dur="4.26">question which is around like the shift</text><text start="1043.76" dur="4.26">in who gets to participate in investing</text><text start="1045.98" dur="4.8">which I think is a really fascinating</text><text start="1048.02" dur="5.039">topic with lots of implications so on</text><text start="1050.78" dur="3.0">the on the carbon Market side</text><text start="1053.059" dur="2.581">um</text><text start="1053.78" dur="4.259">yeah to your point Kevin</text><text start="1055.64" dur="4.86">um I I had been looking at the carbon</text><text start="1058.039" dur="4.38">offset market and realized that</text><text start="1060.5" dur="4.2">um basically the size of the voluntary</text><text start="1062.419" dur="5.701">carbon offset Market</text><text start="1064.7" dur="5.099">um which is basically one that is as</text><text start="1068.12" dur="4.38">expected one in which companies are like</text><text start="1069.799" dur="5.401">voluntarily offsetting carbon emissions</text><text start="1072.5" dur="4.799">versus having to be mandated by the</text><text start="1075.2" dur="4.32">government the voluntary Market is about</text><text start="1077.299" dur="4.441">one percent of the size of the overall</text><text start="1079.52" dur="3.42">carbon offset Market which is really</text><text start="1081.74" dur="3.059">fascinating</text><text start="1082.94" dur="3.979">um so obviously most companies are</text><text start="1084.799" dur="5.821">offset in carbon because they are</text><text start="1086.919" dur="6.461">regulatory forced to do so but the other</text><text start="1090.62" dur="5.58">way to look at that is you know why do</text><text start="1093.38" dur="5.7">those regulations exist why are why are</text><text start="1096.2" dur="5.46">companies being mandated to offset</text><text start="1099.08" dur="4.26">carbon emissions well you know in</text><text start="1101.66" dur="4.2">democratic governments</text><text start="1103.34" dur="4.86">we have to assume that like those</text><text start="1105.86" dur="5.52">regulations reflect the will of the</text><text start="1108.2" dur="4.5">people of consumers and so that</text><text start="1111.38" dur="3.539">mechanism</text><text start="1112.7" dur="5.099">also does reflect</text><text start="1114.919" dur="5.161">um a way to be consumer oriented and</text><text start="1117.799" dur="4.981">reflects how consumers want these</text><text start="1120.08" dur="4.32">companies to act and behave and so</text><text start="1122.78" dur="3.019">there&apos;s lots of different ways for</text><text start="1124.4" dur="4.92">Consumer</text><text start="1125.799" dur="6.701">preferences to evidence themselves and</text><text start="1129.32" dur="4.44">to make their voices heard regulation is</text><text start="1132.5" dur="3.299">maybe like</text><text start="1133.76" dur="4.2">um you know this other path and then</text><text start="1135.799" dur="5.401">directing where their dollars get spent</text><text start="1137.96" dur="5.339">is like a more direct path but both are</text><text start="1141.2" dur="4.02">quite effective in this instance in</text><text start="1143.299" dur="5.101">Shifting the behavior of these companies</text><text start="1145.22" dur="7.98">so I think that&apos;s quite interesting</text><text start="1148.4" dur="6.779">um on the second topic about</text><text start="1153.2" dur="4.5">innovation</text><text start="1155.179" dur="4.86">investing Etc this is a topic that I&apos;ve</text><text start="1157.7" dur="3.96">been thinking a lot about</text><text start="1160.039" dur="3.301">um you know why is it the case that we</text><text start="1161.66" dur="3.06">have the startups that we have why is it</text><text start="1163.34" dur="3.06">the case that we even have the companies</text><text start="1164.72" dur="3.06">that we have in the world if you look at</text><text start="1166.4" dur="3.48">like the biggest companies in the world</text><text start="1167.78" dur="5.16">why are those the biggest companies why</text><text start="1169.88" dur="6.0">why are these startups being funded it</text><text start="1172.94" dur="3.78">goes back to</text><text start="1175.88" dur="3.06">um</text><text start="1176.72" dur="5.459">well lots of things but I think we can</text><text start="1178.94" dur="5.46">look at like the the kind of birth</text><text start="1182.179" dur="4.86">moment of these startups as a very</text><text start="1184.4" dur="4.74">critical moment in which there&apos;s a ton</text><text start="1187.039" dur="4.681">of companies that get started and then</text><text start="1189.14" dur="5.48">today what happens at least in the U.S</text><text start="1191.72" dur="5.88">is that a very special class of firms</text><text start="1194.62" dur="5.799">and individuals who are accredited get</text><text start="1197.6" dur="5.88">to select which companies to deploy</text><text start="1200.419" dur="4.5">dollars into for seed investment and so</text><text start="1203.48" dur="3.72">those are the companies that go on to</text><text start="1204.919" dur="4.561">survive the companies that are then able</text><text start="1207.2" dur="4.2">to continue to raise funding or be</text><text start="1209.48" dur="2.84">profitable are the ones that continue to</text><text start="1211.4" dur="3.96">grow</text><text start="1212.32" dur="5.26">and ultimately you know go public or be</text><text start="1215.36" dur="5.76">successful et cetera and so that</text><text start="1217.58" dur="5.94">question of like who gets to decide like</text><text start="1221.12" dur="4.38">which companies even get to exist is</text><text start="1223.52" dur="4.68">steering innovation in certain</text><text start="1225.5" dur="5.1">directions and today that direction of</text><text start="1228.2" dur="5.339">innovation is being steered by people</text><text start="1230.6" dur="5.22">who are in the position of being Capital</text><text start="1233.539" dur="5.421">allocators they have been entrusted as</text><text start="1235.82" dur="5.94">money managers on behalf of large</text><text start="1238.96" dur="4.839">institutional funds or they are</text><text start="1241.76" dur="4.08">individuals who possess a lot of wealth</text><text start="1243.799" dur="4.26">in the U.S you have to be an accredited</text><text start="1245.84" dur="3.959">or qualified purchaser in order to</text><text start="1248.059" dur="4.261">invest in startups that means your net</text><text start="1249.799" dur="4.981">worth has to be over I think over two</text><text start="1252.32" dur="4.92">million or over 5 million dollars which</text><text start="1254.78" dur="4.98">is a higher bar so obviously this is not</text><text start="1257.24" dur="4.2">a representative set of people who are</text><text start="1259.76" dur="3.84">determining</text><text start="1261.44" dur="4.56">um you know which startups get funded</text><text start="1263.6" dur="4.68">and that in turn has Ripple effects on</text><text start="1266.0" dur="4.38">the types of companies that get backed</text><text start="1268.28" dur="3.96">and that get to exist there&apos;s been all</text><text start="1270.38" dur="4.26">these memes and stories made about like</text><text start="1272.24" dur="3.42">you know Silicon Valley VC is back yet</text><text start="1274.64" dur="4.62">another</text><text start="1275.66" dur="5.639">whatever bubble tea delivery startup</text><text start="1279.26" dur="3.84">and it&apos;s like people make fun of it</text><text start="1281.299" dur="5.221">because it&apos;s like you know this is</text><text start="1283.1" dur="5.34">solving such a niche first class problem</text><text start="1286.52" dur="3.899">um why don&apos;t we go solve some other</text><text start="1288.44" dur="4.38">problems that apply to more people and</text><text start="1290.419" dur="5.941">specifically problems that maybe like</text><text start="1292.82" dur="5.04">more mass consumers have I I think it</text><text start="1296.36" dur="3.54">all ties back to who is doing the</text><text start="1297.86" dur="3.059">funding who who gets to steer the</text><text start="1299.9" dur="3.06">innovation</text><text start="1300.919" dur="4.14">and so that brings me to web three I</text><text start="1302.96" dur="4.199">think one of the most exciting elements</text><text start="1305.059" dur="3.841">of web3 is that it democratizes the</text><text start="1307.159" dur="5.821">landscape of investing</text><text start="1308.9" dur="5.88">and makes it such that in theory anyone</text><text start="1312.98" dur="5.1">can participate in this investment</text><text start="1314.78" dur="4.98">process they get to vote with their feet</text><text start="1318.08" dur="3.12">um and with their dollars and get to</text><text start="1319.76" dur="4.08">participate in that funding process</text><text start="1321.2" dur="5.16">maybe through pulling together their</text><text start="1323.84" dur="5.819">funds on chain into investment clubs or</text><text start="1326.36" dur="5.4">Dows or they get to get together with</text><text start="1329.659" dur="4.861">friends decide which nfts to purchase</text><text start="1331.76" dur="4.74">and which projects to fund they get to</text><text start="1334.52" dur="4.08">see our treasuries like the nouns Dow</text><text start="1336.5" dur="5.7">treasury which is massive into certain</text><text start="1338.6" dur="6.12">you know different directions and so</text><text start="1342.2" dur="5.58">the broader theme is when you get to</text><text start="1344.72" dur="5.339">change who does the investing I think</text><text start="1347.78" dur="4.5">that has radical implications on the</text><text start="1350.059" dur="6.021">types of Innovations and the types of</text><text start="1352.28" dur="3.8">impact that then gets funded</text><text start="1356.72" dur="5.42">so I think that&apos;s that&apos;s a very</text><text start="1358.94" dur="3.2">interesting point and I think</text><text start="1362.539" dur="5.301">I agree on that and I wonder</text><text start="1365.36" dur="4.98">so there&apos;s this thread of web 3</text><text start="1367.84" dur="4.6">creating a new you know participation</text><text start="1370.34" dur="3.959">from like different investors that have</text><text start="1372.44" dur="3.239">like you know different value alignments</text><text start="1374.299" dur="4.141">or you know let&apos;s say that are more like</text><text start="1375.679" dur="4.321">regen focused and</text><text start="1378.44" dur="4.02">there&apos;s a broader question I have about</text><text start="1380.0" dur="4.26">like so what needs to change to get to</text><text start="1382.46" dur="4.56">the point where we have you know more</text><text start="1384.26" dur="4.74">regen investment allocated</text><text start="1387.02" dur="3.779">um to like productive project projects</text><text start="1389.0" dur="3.6">and it&apos;s almost like</text><text start="1390.799" dur="3.901">there&apos;s the kind of creation of these</text><text start="1392.6" dur="4.319">you know how do we get pools of capital</text><text start="1394.7" dur="3.599">or pools of resources that can be</text><text start="1396.919" dur="3.061">allocated and then how do we allocate</text><text start="1398.299" dur="3.721">them in a way that best fits kind of</text><text start="1399.98" dur="3.36">like this regen thesis and how do we</text><text start="1402.02" dur="3.779">keep on doing that in a long way so it</text><text start="1403.34" dur="3.959">seems part of it is like well</text><text start="1405.799" dur="2.941">there&apos;s almost this like wealth</text><text start="1407.299" dur="3.301">generation effect that&apos;s happening in</text><text start="1408.74" dur="3.179">web 3 that is giving people with</text><text start="1410.6" dur="4.199">different kind of backgrounds or value</text><text start="1411.919" dur="4.38">sets the ability to now invest and you</text><text start="1414.799" dur="3.721">know have an increasing share of voice</text><text start="1416.299" dur="3.901">on what gets funded not and then there&apos;s</text><text start="1418.52" dur="4.5">the you know there&apos;s traditional pools</text><text start="1420.2" dur="4.92">of capital that are right now much much</text><text start="1423.02" dur="3.539">more significant is there a way that we</text><text start="1425.12" dur="3.179">can kind of shift and put more of that</text><text start="1426.559" dur="3.781">values alignment in traditional pools of</text><text start="1428.299" dur="3.661">capital to actually get it to be more</text><text start="1430.34" dur="3.48">aligned with this regen thesis you know</text><text start="1431.96" dur="3.36">for example by introducing new incentive</text><text start="1433.82" dur="2.82">systems introducing like secondary</text><text start="1435.32" dur="3.359">purchasers of things that are more</text><text start="1436.64" dur="3.96">impact focused that have like a larger</text><text start="1438.679" dur="3.24">pool of capital that would be able to</text><text start="1440.6" dur="2.699">kind of Leverage The expertise</text><text start="1441.919" dur="3.061">investment in capital allocation</text><text start="1443.299" dur="4.321">expertise of this traditional kind of</text><text start="1444.98" dur="4.199">like a group of investors but do so in a</text><text start="1447.62" dur="3.36">way that aligns them more with kind of</text><text start="1449.179" dur="4.521">the you know the impact thesis or the</text><text start="1450.98" dur="2.72">regen thesis</text><text start="1455.12" dur="5.58">yeah I I think that is the the question</text><text start="1458.9" dur="4.92">of the moment</text><text start="1460.7" dur="5.64">um like I can say that you know from</text><text start="1463.82" dur="4.979">from speaking to hundreds thousands of</text><text start="1466.34" dur="5.88">capital allocators</text><text start="1468.799" dur="6.181">um in my experience most of them are</text><text start="1472.22" dur="4.319">concerned with profit maximization maybe</text><text start="1474.98" dur="3.059">there&apos;s a selection effect with the</text><text start="1476.539" dur="4.26">types of capital allocators that are</text><text start="1478.039" dur="4.321">talking to VCS but most capital in the</text><text start="1480.799" dur="4.38">world are chasing they&apos;re chasing</text><text start="1482.36" dur="5.64">returns and so if we want to shift more</text><text start="1485.179" dur="5.521">of those pools of capital towards regen</text><text start="1488.0" dur="5.28">projects then I think there needs to be</text><text start="1490.7" dur="3.839">a way for that to be tied in or there</text><text start="1493.28" dur="2.82">needs to be proof that that is</text><text

matching pool that</text><text start="1754.039" dur="3.841">is allocated to a crowdfunding campaign</text><text start="1756.26" dur="3.899">according to the number of people that</text><text start="1757.88" dur="5.159">support each project as opposed to the</text><text start="1760.159" dur="5.64">amount that goes into it and that means</text><text start="1763.039" dur="4.201">that you

start="1768.559" dur="4.201">you get way more of the matching pool so</text><text start="1771.38" dur="3.06">um that&apos;s that&apos;s cool because it gets</text><text start="1772.76" dur="3.48">people off their bums to give a dollar</text><text start="1774.44" dur="3.26">at a time because they can have a</text><text start="1776.24" dur="4.5">hundred dollars worth of impact per</text><text start="1777.7" dur="5.02">investment and um it pushes Capital</text><text start="1780.74" dur="4.62">allocation away from central power</text><text start="1782.72" dur="4.679">Brokers that do Capital allocation into</text><text start="1785.36" dur="3.84">the edges of a network and I think it&apos;s</text><text start="1787.399" dur="3.961">like a network model now networks

dur="4.5">top-down hierarchies and I&apos;m wondering</text><text start="1795.74" dur="5.22">if there&apos;s anything there uh with</text><text start="1797.96" dur="5.04">respect to how how we allocate Capital</text><text start="1800.96" dur="5.04">um in a web 3 native way that&apos;s more</text><text start="1803.0" dur="5.82">democratized and and that helps us get</text><text start="1806.0" dur="6.179">away from the need to be Tethered to</text><text start="1808.82" dur="5.28">only just profitable Ventures and and</text><text start="1812.179" dur="4.921">more towards

different audiences but</text><text start="1826.82" dur="3.959">um I think the network intelligence</text><text start="1828.14" dur="5.48">thesis is maybe one of the keys here</text><text start="1830.779" dur="2.841">foreign</text><text start="1836.74" dur="4.48">throw another</text><text start="1839.12" dur="6.299">thing into the pot and stir it as well</text><text start="1841.22" dur="4.8">yeah which is so I think this</text><text start="1845.419" dur="3.721">um</text><text start="1846.02" dur="5.82">theme of how do we shift incentives or</text><text start="1849.14" dur="4.32">how do we fund different types of impact</text><text start="1851.84" dur="4.8">or different types of innovation from</text><text start="1853.46" dur="4.98">what the market would perhaps choose of</text><text start="1856.64" dur="3.779">its own accord</text><text start="1858.44" dur="5.88">um is a really interesting one and I</text><text start="1860.419" dur="7.801">think looking at the market for Orphan</text><text start="1864.32" dur="6.359">drugs is potentially Illuminating</text><text start="1868.22" dur="4.26">um so for for those of you who got for</text><text start="1870.679" dur="3.781">those of you guys who aren&apos;t familiar</text><text start="1872.48" dur="4.26">um with this particular topic orphan</text><text start="1874.46" dur="4.5">drugs are essentially</text><text start="1876.74" dur="4.5">um drugs that are</text><text start="1878.96" dur="5.219">um developed to treat medical conditions</text><text start="1881.24" dur="4.98">that are so rare that they would</text><text start="1884.179" dur="4.141">basically not be researched or developed</text><text start="1886.22" dur="5.76">without government assistance</text><text start="1888.32" dur="5.579">and so in the U.S as well as I think in</text><text start="1891.98" dur="4.26">Europe</text><text start="1893.899" dur="6.301">um there&apos;s different programs that</text><text start="1896.24" dur="6.36">incentivize the r d behind orphan drugs</text><text start="1900.2" dur="4.8">such that you know people who suffer</text><text start="1902.6" dur="5.52">from these really rare conditions could</text><text start="1905.0" dur="5.22">still access drugs that they need and I</text><text start="1908.12" dur="3.84">think there&apos;s some thresholds of what</text><text start="1910.22" dur="4.319">classifies as an orphan drug it&apos;s</text><text start="1911.96" dur="4.74">something like a condition that afflicts</text><text start="1914.539" dur="4.921">you know something like less than 200</text><text start="1916.7" dur="5.64">000 people per year so exceedingly rare</text><text start="1919.46" dur="4.86">and so under normal Market circumstances</text><text start="1922.34" dur="3.959">there&apos;s no way in which these drug</text><text start="1924.32" dur="4.68">companies would actually go ahead and</text><text start="1926.299" dur="5.641">proactively develop drugs to treat these</text><text start="1929.0" dur="5.6">orphan diseases and so</text><text start="1931.94" dur="5.94">the government intervenes in this case</text><text start="1934.6" dur="5.319">and basically creates all sorts of</text><text start="1937.88" dur="4.679">incentive programs including marketing</text><text start="1939.919" dur="5.941">incentives Financial incentives tax</text><text start="1942.559" dur="6.061">credits to promote the development of</text><text start="1945.86" dur="5.28">these orphan drugs and so I think this</text><text start="1948.62" dur="5.039">is It&apos;s really interesting because</text><text start="1951.14" dur="5.159">here there&apos;s not you know a sufficient</text><text start="1953.659" dur="4.681">profit motive to get these corporations</text><text start="1956.299" dur="3.681">to act in a certain way and so there&apos;s</text><text start="1958.34" dur="4.04">outside intervention</text><text start="1959.98" dur="6.34">by the government</text><text start="1962.38" dur="5.74">to change the incentives to create a new</text><text start="1966.32" dur="3.56">profit motive where previously there</text><text start="1968.12" dur="5.4">wasn&apos;t a pre-existing profit motive</text><text start="1969.88" dur="6.34">around this specific type of impact</text><text start="1973.52" dur="4.74">yeah so I can jump in like</text><text start="1976.22" dur="3.66">this I think is like is hitting on</text><text start="1978.26" dur="2.82">something with like the the incentive</text><text start="1979.88" dur="3.179">design problem that&apos;s like super</text><text start="1981.08" dur="3.36">compelling and in this case it&apos;s like</text><text start="1983.059" dur="3.421">the guy it&apos;s a government or a nation</text><text start="1984.44" dur="4.02">state level entity that&apos;s like changing</text><text start="1986.48" dur="3.54">the incentive design because I would</text><text start="1988.46" dur="3.12">argue that it is large enough that it</text><text start="1990.02" dur="2.519">has a value capture umbrella to be able</text><text start="1991.58" dur="3.42">to kind of</text><text start="1992.539" dur="4.14">realize the value of some of this you</text><text start="1995.0" dur="3.419">know the creation of like these new</text><text start="1996.679" dur="3.301">products or projects and they have the</text><text start="1998.419" dur="3.541">ability to kind of like subsidize that</text><text start="1999.98" dur="3.66">in some ways by creating you know profit</text><text start="2001.96" dur="3.78">motive through you know</text><text start="2003.64" dur="3.24">tax structures or like went off grants</text><text start="2005.74" dur="2.76">things like that</text><text start="2006.88" dur="3.36">and I guess it&apos;s like</text><text start="2008.5" dur="2.82">and Kevin like well let&apos;s get your</text><text start="2010.24" dur="2.64">perspective on this one thing that&apos;s</text><text start="2011.32" dur="3.66">interesting to me is like you&apos;re seeing</text><text start="2012.88" dur="3.299">this thing in web 3 emerge where and and</text><text start="2014.98" dur="3.539">I&apos;ll say like</text><text start="2016.179" dur="3.84">I&apos;ll scale it down to this thing to an</text><text start="2018.519" dur="2.461">idea of like Network Goods versus public</text><text start="2020.019" dur="2.52">goods</text><text start="2020.98" dur="4.14">um the idea of network Goods being</text><text start="2022.539" dur="4.561">something that is you know not your</text><text start="2025.12" dur="4.439">traditional VC funded</text><text start="2027.1" dur="3.6">um type project that has you know the</text><text start="2029.559" dur="3.061">ability to like go through the</text><text start="2030.7" dur="3.54">traditional Revenue model um it has like</text><text start="2032.62" dur="3.72">you know it has Revenue you know it</text><text start="2034.24" dur="3.419">generates profits um in and of itself</text><text start="2036.34" dur="3.24">because it captures enough the value</text><text start="2037.659" dur="4.14">that it creates however on a network</text><text start="2039.58" dur="4.26">level it&apos;s actually like extremely</text><text start="2041.799" dur="3.781">important and is therefore subsidized by</text><text start="2043.84" dur="3.3">the ecosystem itself so when the</text><text start="2045.58" dur="3.24">ecosystem typically in the form of a</text><text start="2047.14" dur="2.999">token has this value capture umbrella</text><text start="2048.82" dur="3.66">it&apos;s actually able to invest and</text><text start="2050.139" dur="4.861">incentivize specific types of projects</text><text start="2052.48" dur="4.679">within itself that a typical VC wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="2055.0" dur="3.359">be able to do so and I think it&apos;s super</text><text start="2057.159" dur="2.641">interesting because now you&apos;re seeing a</text><text start="2058.359" dur="3.181">lot of these ecosystems you know</text><text start="2059.8" dur="4.079">creating pledges towards like public</text><text start="2061.54" dur="4.26">goods or network Goods that grow and</text><text start="2063.879" dur="3.48">like the the resource allocation grows</text><text start="2065.8" dur="3.18">as a percentage of the value of the</text><text start="2067.359" dur="4.02">overall ecosystem so it&apos;s creating this</text><text start="2068.98" dur="5.34">new ability for us to you know set</text><text start="2071.379" dur="5.22">almost like ecosystem level regulations</text><text start="2074.32" dur="4.2">or ecosystem level incentives to build</text><text start="2076.599" dur="4.08">kind of publicly within those ecosystems</text><text start="2078.52" dur="3.54">and I wonder how we can expand on that</text><text start="2080.679" dur="2.821">concept because that almost has a</text><text start="2082.06" dur="2.76">corollary too or like you know</text><text start="2083.5" dur="2.52">comparable to like things like the</text><text start="2084.82" dur="2.7">nation states</text><text start="2086.02" dur="2.879">um which is you know setting regulation</text><text start="2087.52" dur="2.639">and other incentivizes important</text><text start="2088.899" dur="3.361">problems</text><text start="2090.159" dur="4.5">yeah I mean uh this is I wrote a post on</text><text start="2092.26" dur="5.88">the the get coin governance forums about</text><text start="2094.659" dur="5.821">a scalable modular pluralistic way of</text><text start="2098.14" dur="5.04">funding public goods and I know that&apos;s a</text><text start="2100.48" dur="4.2">mouthful but um basically the idea is</text><text start="2103.18" dur="4.8">that if you look at the atomic unit of a</text><text start="2104.68" dur="5.82">whole on which is you know either a a</text><text start="2107.98" dur="4.44">whole it&apos;s it&apos;s a it&apos;s a group of people</text><text start="2110.5" dur="3.359">that is a part of a group of other</text><text start="2112.42" dur="3.54">people and like you can look at like</text><text start="2113.859" dur="4.26">Boulder Colorado as a whole on the state</text><text start="2115.96" dur="3.6">of Colorado as a whole on</text><text start="2118.119" dur="3.301">um you can look at you the United States</text><text start="2119.56" dur="4.26">and then the world as as a whole on and</text><text start="2121.42" dur="4.08">it&apos;s kind of hold ons all the way down</text><text start="2123.82" dur="4.32">um and then if you don&apos;t want to index</text><text start="2125.5" dur="5.94">on geography you can index on uh digital</text><text start="2128.14" dur="5.219">ecosystems so uh all of Open Source</text><text start="2131.44" dur="4.44">software is a whole on the ethereum</text><text start="2133.359" dur="4.381">ecosystem is a whole on</text><text start="2135.88" dur="4.02">um all of our our bags in the ethereum</text><text start="2137.74" dur="3.9">system ecosystem depend on consensus</text><text start="2139.9" dur="3.36">clients and execution clients which are</text><text start="2141.64" dur="4.8">their own set of Hollands and then you</text><text start="2143.26" dur="4.92">have the L2 and nft and D5 ones and so</text><text start="2146.44" dur="3.659">um these are modules that if you can</text><text start="2148.18" dur="4.14">allocate funding to the public goods and</text><text start="2150.099" dur="5.281">each of those ecosystems they all stack</text><text start="2152.32" dur="4.44">up and down and you know again I&apos;ll show</text><text start="2155.38" dur="6.32">quadratic funding here what&apos;s really</text><text start="2156.76" dur="8.78">cool is that you can have a 50k uh nft</text><text start="2161.7" dur="8.26">quadratic funding around a 500K ethereum</text><text start="2165.54" dur="7.0">uh quadratic funding round a a 100K</text><text start="2169.96" dur="4.98">ethereum infrastructure quadratic</text><text start="2172.54" dur="4.68">funding round and each of those might</text><text start="2174.94" dur="4.8">provide uh for one dollar of matching</text><text start="2177.22" dur="5.28">five dollars or one dollar of funding</text><text start="2179.74" dur="4.619">five dollars a matching 100 worth of uh</text><text start="2182.5" dur="3.96">matching fifty dollars worth of matching</text><text start="2184.359" dur="4.381">and so like each quadratic funding round</text><text start="2186.46" dur="3.72">at each hold on level is like a fan but</text><text start="2188.74" dur="3.54">all together they&apos;re like a jet engine</text><text start="2190.18" dur="4.26">that creates a huge of like a scalable</text><text start="2192.28" dur="4.079">effect of funding public goods and so</text><text start="2194.44" dur="3.659">it&apos;s about Gathering all of those</text><text start="2196.359" dur="4.201">ecosystems together and creating a</text><text start="2198.099" dur="4.5">network effect that can accelerate the</text><text start="2200.56" dur="3.42">public goods that we all rely on but you</text><text start="2202.599" dur="3.601">know the hard part is where do you get</text><text start="2203.98" dur="3.72">that funding and how do you build the</text><text start="2206.2" dur="2.58">collective intelligence mechanism of</text><text start="2207.7" dur="3.48">which public goods within those</text><text start="2208.78" dur="4.5">ecosystems people care about and it&apos;s</text><text start="2211.18" dur="4.919">it&apos;s building that flywheel I think that</text><text start="2213.28" dur="4.319">is the hard part but um you know I guess</text><text start="2216.099" dur="3.0">if you take nothing away from my little</text><text start="2217.599" dur="2.881">rant here it&apos;s that a hollonic</text><text start="2219.099" dur="3.181">perspective I think is really key</text><text start="2220.48" dur="4.02">because there is a plural verse of</text><text start="2222.28" dur="4.799">public goods and from the local level to</text><text start="2224.5" dur="6.38">the global level and uh we have to be</text><text start="2227.079" dur="3.801">able to reason about a lot of them</text><text start="2231.7" dur="4.74">and and maybe I&apos;ll I&apos;ll throw another</text><text start="2234.579" dur="4.801">wrench in here and I&apos;m really curious</text><text start="2236.44" dur="4.44">about these view on this is like</text><text start="2239.38" dur="2.64">I think I would equate a lot of what you</text><text start="2240.88" dur="2.28">mentioned too like there&apos;s you know</text><text start="2242.02" dur="2.4">there&apos;s different levels of abstraction</text><text start="2243.16" dur="2.64">let&apos;s presume that there&apos;s like</text><text start="2244.42" dur="3.3">different you know there&apos;s increasingly</text><text start="2245.8" dur="3.539">large Capital available at each of those</text><text start="2247.72" dur="4.26">to kind of like put against problems</text><text start="2249.339" dur="5.701">that they think they&apos;re important</text><text start="2251.98" dur="5.16">one thing if like and this is kind of a</text><text start="2255.04" dur="3.66">qualitative assessment is that</text><text start="2257.14" dur="4.02">one of the parts that&apos;s kind of limiting</text><text start="2258.7" dur="5.28">some of this refire impact</text><text start="2261.16" dur="5.04">um type resource allocation is</text><text start="2263.98" dur="3.54">the fact that it&apos;s like it&apos;s a very you</text><text start="2266.2" dur="2.639">know it&apos;s very inefficient right now</text><text start="2267.52" dur="3.9">there&apos;s</text><text start="2268.839" dur="4.921">a lot of difficulty in allocating large</text><text start="2271.42" dur="4.8">amounts of capital towards important</text><text start="2273.76" dur="3.839">impact projects and you know the example</text><text start="2276.22" dur="2.76">I&apos;ll give is like</text><text start="2277.599" dur="3.0">you know this is a very crude example</text><text start="2278.98" dur="4.56">but like if you look at Foundation or</text><text start="2280.599" dur="4.561">NGO spending usually donations there&apos;s a</text><text start="2283.54" dur="3.48">lot of overheads to actually allocate</text><text start="2285.16" dur="3.48">towards um you know the impact that was</text><text start="2287.02" dur="3.72">created and that impact doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2288.64" dur="3.84">necessarily always like get

dur="4.14">of like what was the effectiveness or</text><text start="2296.68" dur="4.32">the you know the efficiency of the</text><text start="2298.3" dur="3.6">capital I deployed towards

the</text><text start="2327.579" dur="2.52">efficiency</text><text start="2328.9" dur="2.459">um through like the development of</text><text start="2330.099" dur="2.641">infrastructure and tooling

dur="3.3">believe that a system can&apos;t believe can</text><text start="2613.359" dur="4.98">be implemented and has no theoretical</text><text start="2615.04" dur="5.1">barriers to doing so that</text><text start="2618.339" dur="3.24">can actually be beneficial and achieve</text><text start="2620.14" dur="2.88">the end State we want so I think like</text><text start="2621.579" dur="3.121">for something like you know the carbon</text><text start="2623.02" dur="4.2">credit Market I think like the idea that</text><text start="2624.7" dur="4.8">we can create a system that takes into</text><text start="2627.22" dur="3.24">account you know environmental impact or</text><text start="2629.5" dur="2.579">value</text><text start="2630.46" dur="3.78">um by like kind of measuring the types</text><text start="2632.079" dur="3.24">of environmental impact we have even if</text><text start="2634.24" dur="2.46">it&apos;s like we&apos;re not going to capture</text><text start="2635.319" dur="3.54">every variable because it&apos;s a very</text><text start="2636.7" dur="3.84">non-linear type thing but we can at</text><text start="2638.859" dur="2.941">least capture some of like the terms we</text><text start="2640.54" dur="2.279">can capture kind of like the linear</text><text start="2641.8" dur="3.42">effects</text><text start="2642.819" dur="4.26">and even you know I don&apos;t know the exact</text><text start="2645.22" dur="4.02">statistics because I&apos;m not like a carbon</text><text start="2647.079" dur="4.141">credit market so or expert so I won&apos;t</text><text start="2649.24" dur="2.94">get into that but from my understanding</text><text start="2651.22" dur="3.119">the</text><text start="2652.18" dur="3.78">the the amount of resources that have</text><text start="2654.339" dur="3.0">been now deployed into the carbon credit</text><text start="2655.96" dur="3.659">markets</text><text start="2657.339" dur="3.721">has significantly increased due to the</text><text start="2659.619" dur="2.881">presence of the infrastructure that</text><text start="2661.06" dur="3.779">allows people to invest and put</text><text start="2662.5" dur="5.22">resources into it how much of that is</text><text start="2664.839" dur="4.621">you know actual kind of like carbon</text><text start="2667.72" dur="3.42">offset for example versus like</text><text start="2669.46" dur="3.84">derivatives built on top</text><text start="2671.14" dur="3.12">um with like an ESG flavor that I&apos;m not</text><text start="2673.3" dur="3.84">sure and somebody will have to fact</text><text start="2674.26" dur="5.16">check me on but I&apos;d be curious to</text><text start="2677.14" dur="4.26">understand if kind of like the net</text><text start="2679.42" dur="3.659">impact understanding the noise the</text><text start="2681.4" dur="4.439">signal noise of like a lot of that is</text><text start="2683.079" dur="4.201">going to be like

now and like we&apos;re still</text><text start="2689.38" dur="3.479">getting better is there a path to</text><text start="2691.24" dur="3.42">progress where we can deal with an</text><text

you know tooling needs</text><text start="2699.22" dur="2.46">to be built infrastructure needs to be</text><text start="2700.359" dur="4.681">developed methodology needs to be</text><text start="2701.68" dur="4.919">refined to get us to the point we need</text><text start="2705.04" dur="3.9">that that&apos;s kind of like the comparison</text><text start="2706.599" dur="4.141">or the you know that what I would put</text><text start="2708.94" dur="4.02">out there for for carbon markets is like</text><text start="2710.74" dur="4.26">yes it&apos;s imperfect</text><text start="2712.96" dur="3.3">we believe that it can get for can get</text><text start="2715.0" dur="3.599">better and we&apos;re working to make it</text><text start="2716.26" dur="5.24">better does that

dur="4.321">the opinion in that we should not let</text><text start="2727.18" dur="5.04">um you know the perfect be the enemy of</text><text start="2728.92" dur="4.26">the good and so</text><text start="2732.22" dur="2.879">um</text><text start="2733.18" dur="4.26">yeah I think I think moving towards</text><text start="2735.099" dur="5.701">developing infrastructure such that</text><text start="2737.44" dur="5.94">different types of impact can be more</text><text start="2740.8" dur="4.62">transparently invested in and capital</text><text start="2743.38" dur="3.42">can be allocated

start="2754.9" dur="3.179">to say that</text><text start="2757.24" dur="3.8">um</text><text start="2758.079" dur="6.0">I had another point but I forgot it</text><text start="2761.04" dur="5.02">well uh let us know if it comes back to</text><text start="2764.079" dur="3.841">you Lee I think we&apos;ve been diverging for</text><text start="2766.06" dur="3.36">about 45 minutes at this point and we</text><text start="2767.92" dur="4.08">only have 10 minutes left of recording</text><text start="2769.42" dur="4.14">so we&apos;ll have to start converging I</text><text start="2772.0"

dur="3.9">um like I I I definitely don&apos;t take it</text><text start="2854.44" dur="2.879">as a matter of course that the things</text><text start="2855.88" dur="3.42">that are getting started the

and</text><text start="2926.56" dur="3.48">like a you know an open dialogue more so</text><text start="2928.42" dur="3.179">than you know from my understanding has</text><text start="2930.04" dur="3.36">happened before about these types of</text><text start="2931.599" dur="3.061">fundamental problems</text><text start="2933.4" dur="2.76">um which has turned into like Community</text><text start="2934.66" dur="2.76">engagement it&apos;s it&apos;s led to a lot of</text><text start="2936.16" dur="3.24">willingness of people to explore these</text><text start="2937.42" dur="5.28">ideas and push on it</text><text start="2939.4" dur="4.679">um and I think that has led to</text><text start="2942.7" dur="2.7">but not just discussions we&apos;re having</text><text start="2944.079" dur="3.421">right now but a lot of development and</text><text start="2945.4" dur="3.36">experimentation around you know how do</text><text start="2947.5" dur="2.819">we change some of these things that we</text><text start="2948.76" dur="4.319">thought were fixed but can actually now</text><text start="2950.319" dur="4.681">be you know more malleable so you know</text><text start="2953.079" dur="3.78">what if we did resource allocation using</text><text start="2955.0" dur="3.66">a Dao instead of a government or an NGO</text><text start="2956.859" dur="3.421">or a foundation what would that look</text><text start="2958.66" dur="2.88">like how would we more effectively kind</text><text start="2960.28" dur="3.12">of like use</text><text start="2961.54" dur="3.66">get closer to the bottom and get people</text><text start="2963.4" dur="3.419">to like solve for the solution space</text><text start="2965.2" dur="3.06">that is like more kind of like Optimal</text><text start="2966.819" dur="2.641">globally versus like what is more</text><text start="2968.26" dur="2.52">centrally dictated</text><text start="2969.46" dur="2.639">and I think there&apos;s a lot of experiments</text><text start="2970.78" dur="3.18">you know quadratic voting and the growth</text><text start="2972.099" dur="3.541">of Bitcoin has been fantastic you know</text><text start="2973.96" dur="3.3">optimism and the work that they&apos;re doing</text><text start="2975.64" dur="3.12">um some of the work with various things</text><text start="2977.26" dur="3.0">around impact certificates and like the</text><text start="2978.76" dur="3.3">data layers that will kind of enable the</text><text start="2980.26" dur="2.819">infrastructure here I think is super</text><text start="2982.06" dur="2.58">exciting</text><text start="2983.079" dur="3.181">um and just it&apos;s all been brought around</text><text start="2984.64" dur="3.78">by this you know this latest kind of</text><text start="2986.26" dur="4.319">focus on web3 and is bringing in others</text><text start="2988.42" dur="4.32">like you know values aligned investors</text><text start="2990.579" dur="4.26">and and people from all over all over</text><text start="2992.74" dur="5.78">different fields which is fascinating</text><text start="2994.839" dur="3.681">the part that worries me is</text><text start="2998.92" dur="4.86">I think it&apos;s like this is this is not</text><text start="3001.14" dur="5.58">going to be solved in that year and we</text><text start="3003.78" dur="4.2">need to kind of maintain momentum and</text><text start="3006.72" dur="3.119">you know through the ups and downs of</text><text start="3007.98" dur="3.72">the market in web 3 let&apos;s say but you</text><text start="3009.839" dur="3.601">know more broadly like we need dedicated</text><text start="3011.7" dur="4.26">efforts and like you know support to do</text><text start="3013.44" dur="5.46">so over a long long term</text><text start="3015.96" dur="4.68">and I worry that you know if we don&apos;t</text><text start="3018.9" dur="2.76">set up the right structure for people to</text><text start="3020.64" dur="2.82">think about this in the long term and</text><text start="3021.66" dur="3.06">work through these issues um kind of</text><text start="3023.46" dur="2.879">like we won&apos;t make the progress we need</text><text start="3024.72" dur="2.7">as fast as possible</text><text start="3026.339" dur="3.061">um and</text><text start="3027.42" dur="4.02">this like</text><text start="3029.4" dur="4.56">you know this</text><text start="3031.44" dur="4.379">this momentum in the web 3 space</text><text start="3033.96" dur="3.899">um in particular might become like</text><text start="3035.819" dur="4.26">ossified before it can really you know</text><text start="3037.859" dur="3.601">reach its full potential um is something</text><text start="3040.079" dur="2.941">that I worry about and like what is the</text><text start="3041.46" dur="3.18">right way of doing it well pushing</text><text start="3043.02" dur="3.299">experimentation while not overreaching</text><text start="3044.64" dur="4.56">and you know creating some like very</text><text start="3046.319" dur="5.461">negative externalities thank you so much</text><text start="3049.2" dur="5.399">uh let&apos;s see uh last question where can</text><text start="3051.78" dur="5.22">people find you and your work online</text><text start="3054.599" dur="3.661">Matthew why don&apos;t we start with you</text><text start="3057.0" dur="3.48">sure thing</text><text start="3058.26" dur="3.059">um the best way to I think read more</text><text start="3060.48" dur="3.599">about</text><text start="3061.319" dur="3.901">us and our work is uh by going to fund</text><text start="3064.079" dur="3.421">in the Commons</text><text start="3065.22" dur="4.68">um dot IO it&apos;s a</text><text start="3067.5" dur="3.96">it&apos;s an event that we throw you know</text><text start="3069.9" dur="3.659">with shelling points and a lot of our</text><text start="3071.46" dur="4.02">good collaborators from Bitcoin and you</text><text start="3073.559" dur="3.0">know the VC world but we explore a lot</text><text start="3075.48" dur="3.18">of these topics and there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="3076.559" dur="4.141">good material that can help people get</text><text start="3078.66" dur="3.419">up to speed um I know Bitcoin also has</text><text start="3080.7" dur="3.54">done a really good like intro to public</text><text start="3082.079" dur="3.54">goods so you can find a lot of our you</text><text start="3084.24" dur="4.859">know latest experimentation to find the</text><text start="3085.619" dur="6.98">commons explained in video form</text><text start="3089.099" dur="3.5">great Lee same question to you</text><text start="3092.66" dur="5.26">most of my writing is at</text><text start="3094.88" dur="5.439">lead.substack.com and Twitter is</text><text start="3097.92" dur="5.399">probably my most frequent Channel</text><text start="3100.319" dur="5.841">um I&apos;m Elgin 18 there and if I can just</text><text start="3103.319" dur="2.841">add one more thing</text><text start="3106.26" dur="5.22">um yeah so</text><text start="3108.72" dur="5.399">um Matt&apos;s comment sparked this just now</text><text start="3111.48" dur="6.24">in terms of what I&apos;m tepid about</text><text start="3114.119" dur="6.421">um in this uh in this General space</text><text start="3117.72" dur="5.16">I think going back to uh what I was</text><text start="3120.54" dur="4.319">saying earlier about how changing who</text><text start="3122.88" dur="3.66">can be an investor changes what gets</text><text start="3124.859" dur="3.661">invested in</text><text start="3126.54" dur="4.68">um I think one thing that</text><text start="3128.52" dur="5.059">worries me or concern that I have is</text><text start="3131.22" dur="2.359">that</text><text start="3133.68" dur="5.939">you know the people who are able to</text><text start="3135.66" dur="7.199">participate in these new funding systems</text><text start="3139.619" dur="5.761">are not representative at all of people</text><text start="3142.859" dur="4.021">at large of society at large</text><text start="3145.38" dur="4.08">um and the types of goals that they hold</text><text start="3146.88" dur="4.979">may be you know not representative or</text><text start="3149.46" dur="3.72">actually in conflict with many other</text><text start="3151.859" dur="4.2">people</text><text start="3153.18" dur="4.62">um who are not participating right now</text><text start="3156.059" dur="5.04">and so</text><text start="3157.8" dur="6.059">um you know the the democratization of</text><text start="3161.099" dur="6.0">finance of investing in Innovation like</text><text start="3163.859" dur="4.74">I think that works well only when that</text><text start="3167.099" dur="4.081">system is</text><text start="3168.599" dur="6.48">available and accessible to all</text><text start="3171.18" dur="5.28">versus a select View and so that</text><text start="3175.079" dur="4.441">definitely is one of my concerns about</text><text start="3176.46" dur="4.26">the space and then I think another point</text><text start="3179.52" dur="4.26">is</text><text start="3180.72" dur="3.96">that I think we all collectively need to</text><text start="3183.78" dur="3.36">have</text><text start="3184.68" dur="5.52">a level of like self-awareness and</text><text start="3187.14" dur="5.52">almost like a framework for how we</text><text start="3190.2" dur="4.08">determine what is worthwhile and what</text><text start="3192.66" dur="3.78">types of impact we care about in the</text><text start="3194.28" dur="5.64">world to start with like there needs to</text><text start="3196.44" dur="5.82">be that that philosophical grounding and</text><text start="3199.92" dur="3.78">knowledge about what we care about in</text><text start="3202.26" dur="3.359">this world and what we would like it to</text><text start="3203.7" dur="3.24">see in order to even start thinking</text><text start="3205.619" dur="4.5">about allocating capital in that</text><text start="3206.94" dur="5.76">direction this was the topic of a recent</text><text start="3210.119" dur="4.621">post that I wrote about</text><text start="3212.7" dur="4.379">um it&apos;s called a theory of justice for</text><text start="3214.74" dur="5.4">web3 and it&apos;s inspired by John rawls&apos;s</text><text start="3217.079" dur="4.5">book a theory of Justice in which he</text><text start="3220.14" dur="3.78">talks about you know how should we even</text><text start="3221.579" dur="4.681">think about allocating resources in a</text><text start="3223.92" dur="5.699">society like given that we have scarce</text><text start="3226.26" dur="4.44">goods and scarce resources how do we</text><text start="3229.619" dur="1.74">think about</text><text start="3230.7" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="3231.359" dur="6.96">distribution of the of scarcity like</text><text start="3234.42" dur="6.72">what is societally optimal and so that</text><text start="3238.319" dur="4.8">then leads to an examination of the idea</text><text start="3241.14" dur="3.3">of fairness and Justice and what does</text><text start="3243.119" dur="2.881">fair look like</text><text start="3244.44" dur="2.94">and so I think that&apos;s that&apos;s actually</text><text start="3246.0" dur="2.94">the starting point to this entire</text><text start="3247.38" dur="4.02">conversation and I feel like people are</text><text start="3248.94" dur="5.76">skipping it and moving too quickly and</text><text start="3251.4" dur="4.14">jumping instead to this haphazard</text><text start="3254.7" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="3255.54" dur="7.079">grasping at different types of impacts</text><text start="3258.72" dur="5.879">in a way that doesn&apos;t first is not first</text><text start="3262.619" dur="4.021">rooted in that kind of self-reflective</text><text start="3264.599" dur="4.02">process</text><text start="3266.64" dur="3.36">beautifully seated</text><text start="3268.619" dur="3.121">Matt did you want to respond to that</text><text start="3270.0" dur="3.48">before we break</text><text start="3271.74" dur="4.2">no I think it&apos;s a great point I would</text><text start="3273.48" dur="3.839">expand even further by</text><text start="3275.94" dur="2.94">no it&apos;s</text><text start="3277.319" dur="2.76">even in the systems and like the</text><text start="3278.88" dur="3.3">foundations that we&apos;re building right</text><text start="3280.079" dur="3.421">now from like a thought perspective and</text><text start="3282.18" dur="2.7">just like it you know a framework</text><text start="3283.5" dur="3.0">perspective</text><text start="3284.88" dur="2.939">um you know things like the protocols</text><text start="3286.5" dur="3.9">we&apos;re designing and the way they were</text><text start="3287.819" dur="4.381">designing staking systems um</text><text start="3290.4" dur="3.9">the more people we can have from more</text><text start="3292.2" dur="4.32">diverse backgrounds</text><text start="3294.3" dur="4.019">the more we can we need to like really</text><text start="3296.52" dur="3.18">solve for that early on to understand</text><text start="3298.319" dur="3.421">like where our blind spots are because</text><text start="3299.7" dur="4.919">like anything that we do introduces bias</text><text start="3301.74" dur="4.319">and the longer we wait to like solve for</text><text start="3304.619" dur="3.48">having the full perspective for</text><text start="3306.059" dur="3.961">everybody that should be involved</text><text start="3308.099" dur="3.421">um the more things get set in stone so</text><text start="3310.02" dur="2.88">you know not not just like the funding</text><text start="3311.52" dur="4.319">but also like the design the</text><text start="3312.9" dur="4.74">conversations like um everything</text><text start="3315.839" dur="2.881">we shouldn&apos;t take anything to be like a</text><text start="3317.64" dur="3.36">kind of fundamental truth and everything</text><text start="3318.72" dur="6.0">is like influenced by our bias</text><text start="3321.0" dur="6.78">I will say I feel an intense uh</text><text start="3324.72" dur="5.339">being feeling stretched between the the</text><text start="3327.78" dur="6.299">sort of ipcc&apos;s report on climate change</text><text start="3330.059" dur="5.941">saying we have eight years uh to to to</text><text start="3334.079" dur="3.961">get to carbon neutrality or eight years</text><text start="3336.0" dur="3.78">to start really solving the problem in</text><text start="3338.04" dur="3.9">that urgency versus setting up a</text><text start="3339.78" dur="3.66">long-term architecture and there&apos;s that</text><text start="3341.94" dur="5.52">I really feel stuck between those things</text><text start="3343.44" dur="6.06">I I&apos;m sure listeners do also but</text><text start="3347.46" dur="3.119">um this is a sign that we&apos;re on to</text><text start="3349.5" dur="2.579">something really important I think that</text><text start="3350.579" dur="4.441">we keep diverging and we keep exploring</text><text
