I&apos;m really interested</text><text start="252.42" dur="5.52">in diving in on on this episode so what</text><text start="255.84" dur="3.48">uh what&apos;s on your minds I guess Divia</text><text start="257.94" dur="3.299">you want to go first</text><text start="259.32" dur="4.819">yeah well as we were talking about right</text><text start="261.239" dur="5.46">before recording um thinking about</text><text start="264.139" dur="4.78">decentralization is top of mind for me</text><text start="266.699" dur="4.981">right now and in particular I think this</text><text start="268.919" dur="4.801">is quite timely uh with obviously moves</text><text start="271.68" dur="4.739">in the market what does it mean when we</text><text start="273.72" dur="6.12">call for decentralization and reframing</text><text start="276.419" dur="6.0">aiming for more decentralization uh into</text><text start="279.84" dur="4.44">better decentralization what is the</text><text start="282.419" dur="3.72">right kind of decentralization that we</text><text start="284.28" dur="3.54">should be aiming for in a system and I</text><text start="286.139" dur="3.601">think this is I mean on one hand it&apos;s a</text><text start="287.82" dur="4.68">political Theory question and my work</text><text start="289.74" dur="4.14">Started With You Know Field work uh with</text><text start="292.5" dur="3.54">social movements and political</text><text start="293.88" dur="4.259">institutions in India and in the US and</text><text start="296.04" dur="3.96">thinking about how they coordinate</text><text start="298.139" dur="3.661">action and so that&apos;s kind of where some</text><text start="300.0" dur="4.139">of my background is at</text><text start="301.8" dur="4.2">um and decentralization is quite</text><text start="304.139" dur="3.661">important from that perspective but it&apos;s</text><text start="306.0" dur="3.6">also obviously a core part of the</text><text start="307.8" dur="2.7">socio-technical conversations we&apos;re now</text><text start="309.6" dur="2.28">having</text><text start="310.5" dur="3.479">um around web3 and there&apos;s incredible</text><text start="311.88" dur="3.78">promise in decentralization that I think</text><text start="313.979" dur="3.601">comes from focusing on what we want out</text><text start="315.66" dur="4.02">of decentralization and how we structure</text><text start="317.58" dur="4.02">decentralization to get there</text><text start="319.68" dur="4.44">um through what you know we or I call</text><text start="321.6" dur="4.319">subsidiarity instead of redundancy which</text><text start="324.12" dur="3.0">I think is probably too broad to get</text><text start="325.919" dur="4.141">into with what are you thinking about</text><text start="327.12" dur="4.919">question but in essence what is good</text><text start="330.06" dur="5.52">decentralization and how do we get there</text><text start="332.039" dur="5.401">is top of Mind great okay all right what</text><text start="335.58" dur="3.72">kind what is good decentralization what</text><text start="337.44" dur="3.56">types of collective intelligence do we</text><text start="339.3" dur="5.399">want and how do we facilitate that</text><text start="341.0" dur="4.96">subsidiarity versus redundancy</text><text start="344.699" dur="2.641">um all right I&apos;ve got some questions</text><text start="345.96" dur="2.7">that I&apos;m going to ask but I&apos;m going to</text><text start="347.34" dur="2.52">ask that for parity I&apos;m gonna ask</text><text start="348.66" dur="3.84">Raymond what what are you thinking about</text><text start="349.86" dur="3.96">right now Raymond yes um I think I mean</text><text start="352.5" dur="4.139">all of the all the things that you&apos;ve</text><text start="353.82" dur="4.74">just mentioned um we&apos;re building all of</text><text start="356.639" dur="3.721">these new systems and putting them out</text><text start="358.56" dur="3.359">in the world and seeing some of them you</text><text start="360.36" dur="3.54">know completely</text><text start="361.919" dur="4.981">um some of them grow enormously large</text><text start="363.9" dur="5.16">and some of them Crash and Burn and</text><text start="366.9" dur="3.9">it&apos;s just like such an interesting time</text><text start="369.06" dur="4.44">um to be to be participating in this um</text><text start="370.8" dur="4.679">things I&apos;m thinking about include how do</text><text start="373.5" dur="3.9">we just like think about things from a</text><text start="375.479" dur="4.081">very structural perspective like how can</text><text start="377.4" dur="5.1">create we create digital spaces that</text><text start="379.56" dur="5.22">allow for the kinds of interactions and</text><text start="382.5" dur="4.319">Collective this kind of collective</text><text start="384.78" dur="4.199">intelligence to emerge and then</text><text start="386.819" dur="4.561">practically bridging that a lot with</text><text start="388.979" dur="3.901">mechanism design and product design so</text><text start="391.38" dur="3.42">like what do these systems look like</text><text start="392.88" dur="3.36">when they&apos;re out in the wild and the</text><text start="394.8" dur="3.06">first people in the world start to use</text><text start="396.24" dur="3.36">them and how do they grow into</text><text start="397.86" dur="3.72">institutions after that</text><text start="399.6" dur="4.74">right it&apos;s actually a really good</text><text start="401.58" dur="4.44">lead-in to uh I think your work at</text><text start="404.34" dur="3.54">verses and I think that I&apos;ve played with</text><text start="406.02" dur="3.72">some of those sites interdependence</text><text start="407.88" dur="6.24">space and uh can you tell us a little</text><text start="409.74" dur="8.16">bit about how versus plays into into the</text><text start="414.12" dur="5.82">that sort of field of design</text><text start="417.9" dur="4.56">yeah I think a versus is a gathering</text><text start="419.94" dur="4.92">space in sort of an open space</text><text start="422.46" dur="4.44">foremost</text><text start="424.86" dur="4.26">or around people who were you know</text><text start="426.9" dur="4.139">writers and researchers and artists and</text><text start="429.12" dur="3.54">technologists really thinking about how</text><text start="431.039" dur="3.06">do we build these interdependent digital</text><text start="432.66" dur="2.7">Futures and how do we create a space</text><text start="434.099" dur="3.241">where we are meaningfully working</text><text start="435.36" dur="3.899">towards that goal in a loose</text><text start="437.34" dur="3.84">confederation so itself sort of</text><text start="439.259" dur="3.901">decentralized and</text><text start="441.18" dur="3.66">um for example the pluriverse artifact</text><text start="443.16" dur="3.599">which I&apos;m much more familiar with since</text><text start="444.84" dur="3.0">I was one of the leads on that</text><text start="446.759" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="447.84" dur="5.4">try to articulate what does it look like</text><text start="450.599" dur="4.561">to have a world in which many multiple</text><text start="453.24" dur="4.26">ways of being and knowing interact with</text><text start="455.16" dur="4.319">each other and to say that that world is</text><text start="457.5" dur="4.02">actually more powerful and stronger and</text><text start="459.479" dur="3.961">can grow faster than sort of the</text><text start="461.52" dur="5.64">monocultural technological space we&apos;ve</text><text start="463.44" dur="5.22">been given uh and so again that requires</text><text start="467.16" dur="3.42">right people who are thinking about the</text><text start="468.66" dur="4.56">technological side people are thinking</text><text start="470.58" dur="4.44">about you know the art and the how does</text><text start="473.22" dur="3.3">that world feel and the philosophy</text><text start="475.02" dur="2.94">behind it people are thinking about</text><text start="476.52" dur="2.82">designing the political economic</text><text start="477.96" dur="3.959">mechanisms for that world and I think</text><text start="479.34" dur="4.44">versus can bring some of those folks</text><text start="481.919" dur="3.84">together but really the reason to me</text><text start="483.78" dur="4.56">it&apos;s a gathering space is well we have</text><text start="485.759" dur="4.261">no interest in sort of being the</text><text start="488.34" dur="3.12">stewards of the plural verse first and</text><text start="490.02" dur="4.619">foremost right we have an interest in</text><text start="491.46" dur="5.04">putting that concept out and bringing in</text><text start="494.639" dur="3.24">as many voices and people as possible</text><text start="496.5" dur="2.819">who are already thinking about these</text><text start="497.879" dur="3.481">things and really fitting ourselves into</text><text start="499.319" dur="4.681">what&apos;s missing in this ecosystem</text><text start="501.36" dur="5.64">ecological space rather than like what</text><text start="504.0" dur="5.22">is what is versus going to be so so can</text><text start="507.0" dur="4.86">we get just get through a a simple use</text><text start="509.22" dur="4.08">case of versus I&apos;ve got pluriverse.world</text><text start="511.86" dur="3.179">up on my browser right now and that&apos;s</text><text start="513.3" dur="3.299">also going to be in the show notes it&apos;s</text><text start="515.039" dur="3.18">basically a place where we can go and we</text><text start="516.599" dur="3.661">can read about</text><text start="518.219" dur="4.26">um a vision for the plural of plural</text><text start="520.26" dur="4.019">verse as opposed to the metaverse I</text><text start="522.479" dur="3.721">think a world where many worlds fit and</text><text start="524.279" dur="4.201">then you can sign it annotate it and</text><text start="526.2" dur="4.079">Fork it and kind of a test that this is</text><text start="528.48" dur="3.84">a shared value system that that you have</text><text start="530.279" dur="3.841">and so this is a collective intelligence</text><text start="532.32" dur="4.139">in action did I just</text><text start="534.12" dur="3.96">summarize the use case fairly well like</text><text start="536.459" dur="4.021">any comments on that</text><text start="538.08" dur="4.14">no I think that&apos;s great Raymond yeah I</text><text start="540.48" dur="3.359">think it&apos;s um it&apos;s definitely very</text><text start="542.22" dur="3.299">nascent and we&apos;ve gone through this</text><text start="543.839" dur="3.18">journey of for starting out with the</text><text start="545.519" dur="3.661">Declaration of interdependence where you</text><text start="547.019" dur="4.5">could sign to the plural verse artifact</text><text start="549.18" dur="4.5">where you can sign and create something</text><text start="551.519" dur="3.781">of your own and we&apos;re continuing to</text><text start="553.68" dur="4.02">explore like what these patterns mean</text><text start="555.3" dur="5.219">and whether we can develop them to a</text><text start="557.7" dur="4.44">whole language that lets people sort of</text><text start="560.519" dur="3.421">start to prefigure and create the</text><text start="562.14" dur="4.74">pluribus</text><text start="563.94" dur="4.079">amazing yeah I know I&apos;ve uh contacted</text><text start="566.88" dur="4.079">you a couple weeks ago because I&apos;m</text><text start="568.019" dur="5.461">looking to launch an essay uh with Aaron</text><text start="570.959" dur="4.44">McMillan about uh practical pluralism</text><text start="573.48" dur="4.02">and we&apos;re going to use versus Tech in</text><text

be an obvious</text><text start="580.74" dur="3.539">extension of that uh since you all have</text><text start="582.66" dur="3.119">so much traction with the pluriverse</text><text start="584.279" dur="4.321">world and I think interdependence Dot</text><text start="585.779" dur="5.581">online was the other one is that right</text><text start="588.6" dur="4.5">yeah exactly and I think that is a core</text><text start="591.36" dur="4.56">piece of the goal like how do we build</text><text start="593.1" dur="5.16">experiments that others can build on top</text><text start="595.92" dur="4.26">of and that itself is us you know this</text><text start="598.26" dur="5.4">concept of prefiguration I think is core</text><text start="600.18" dur="5.64">two versus and to me which is how do you</text><text start="603.66" dur="4.56">create the world that you want to see</text><text start="605.82" dur="4.5">now you&apos;re not waiting for it you build</text><text start="608.22" dur="3.84">that ethos into everything you put out</text><text start="610.32" dur="3.42">in the moment and that means that when</text><text start="612.06" dur="3.779">people use and interact with and engage</text><text start="613.74" dur="4.14">with what you&apos;re creating it is already</text><text start="615.839" dur="3.541">that interaction is the world you want</text><text start="617.88" dur="3.36">to see right</text><text start="619.38" dur="4.86">um and I think that is very core to what</text><text start="621.24" dur="4.5">versus is trying to do where we as a</text><text start="624.24" dur="3.779">small Collective aren&apos;t going to replace</text><text start="625.74" dur="4.44">the metaverse are we but we can</text><text start="628.019" dur="3.721">pre-figure what that would look and feel</text><text start="630.18" dur="4.14">like and the more people use that</text><text start="631.74" dur="4.2">pre-figurative technology the more we</text><text start="634.32" dur="3.9">are we are doing that transition already</text><text start="635.94" dur="4.079">and I think that&apos;s what we&apos;re so excited</text><text start="638.22" dur="3.119">about people using that</text><text start="640.019" dur="3.541">um platform in the way that you&apos;re</text><text start="641.339" dur="4.021">describing exactly and although versus</text><text start="643.56" dur="3.18">is very nascent and you know we&apos;re at</text><text start="645.36" dur="2.7">this point a collective of people who</text><text start="646.74" dur="3.719">want to see something happen and are</text><text start="648.06" dur="4.62">reaching towards it in different ways</text><text start="650.459" dur="5.221">um it is that principle that I think</text><text start="652.68" dur="4.44">underlies what is possible when you are</text><text start="655.68" dur="4.56">small when you&apos;re not going to achieve</text><text start="657.12" dur="5.339">scale through something that is uh you</text><text start="660.24" dur="3.96">know scales scale without change it&apos;s</text><text start="662.459" dur="4.261">scale through Federation rather than</text><text start="664.2" dur="4.379">scale through like peer growth</text><text start="666.72" dur="3.48">what I respect so much about both of you</text><text start="668.579" dur="3.241">is that you&apos;re just such deep thinkers</text><text start="670.2" dur="3.24">on the theoretical level and you clearly</text><text start="671.82" dur="3.18">have such a strong command of these</text><text start="673.44" dur="2.88">Concepts from the theory but you&apos;re</text><text start="675.0" dur="4.5">experimenting with these deeply</text><text start="676.32" dur="4.92">beautiful sights of putting those Theory</text><text start="679.5" dur="4.68">into action and I almost see you in this</text><text start="681.24" dur="5.24">in this Theory action learning loop as</text><text start="684.18" dur="5.839">you explore the space is is that a fair</text><text start="686.48" dur="3.539">uh observation</text><text start="690.779" dur="4.68">I would say it&apos;s an aspiration so if it</text><text start="693.54" dur="4.14">also functions as an observation then</text><text start="695.459" dur="4.021">we&apos;re doing something</text><text start="697.68" dur="4.14">okay sounds good</text><text start="699.48" dur="3.479">um well I&apos;d love to dive in on the work</text><text start="701.82" dur="3.0">that you&apos;re doing in the collective</text><text start="702.959" dur="4.38">intelligence space and I&apos;ll ask a very</text><text start="704.82" dur="5.4">broad question that</text><text start="707.339" dur="4.381">um I think I&apos;d just be curious to have</text><text start="710.22" dur="3.239">you take the wheel and steer a little</text><text start="711.72" dur="3.54">bit both of you but what types of</text><text start="713.459" dur="3.841">collective intelligence do we want and</text><text start="715.26" dur="3.6">and how do we create it uh I&apos;d be</text><text start="717.3" dur="2.82">curious here I guess uh from you first</text><text start="718.86" dur="2.4">Raymond</text><text start="720.12" dur="3.0">yeah</text><text start="721.26" dur="3.66">um so I think like even starting from</text><text start="723.12" dur="3.839">within versus like</text><text start="724.92" dur="4.32">the community I work on governance at</text><text start="726.959" dur="5.161">verses and have been sort of focused on</text><text start="729.24" dur="4.62">that and were a reasonably diverse</text><text start="732.12" dur="3.12">Collective alongside along like</text><text start="733.86" dur="3.419">disciplinary</text><text start="735.24" dur="4.56">um I want disciplinary dimensions and</text><text start="737.279" dur="3.901">measures and we all think about things</text><text start="739.8" dur="3.06">in very different ways and so how do we</text><text start="741.18" dur="4.38">like go about reconciling all the</text><text start="742.86" dur="5.82">different directions and uh preferences</text><text start="745.56" dur="4.44">and that we have as a group and so we</text><text start="748.68" dur="2.399">have been doing a lot of experimenting</text><text start="750.0" dur="2.82">there</text><text start="751.079" dur="3.961">um and figuring out like a lot of this</text><text start="752.82" dur="3.9">is not systematized right now it&apos;s</text><text start="755.04" dur="4.2">happening in conversations around the</text><text start="756.72" dur="3.96">group but as technologists we&apos;re also</text><text start="759.24" dur="3.539">thinking about like how could these</text><text start="760.68" dur="3.48">things extend to design patterns that</text><text start="762.779" dur="3.06">could like help people Express their</text><text start="764.16" dur="3.479">preferences and other other governance</text><text start="765.839" dur="3.781">situations</text><text start="767.639" dur="4.981">um and to do this we&apos;ve been looking at</text><text start="769.62" dur="6.659">tools like digital democracy tools and</text><text start="772.62" dur="5.219">polis and lumio and other systems for</text><text start="776.279" dur="3.921">um we&apos;re doing this that are out in the</text><text start="777.839" dur="2.361">world today</text><text start="780.779" dur="4.5">yeah I think given the Raymond has done</text><text start="783.18" dur="3.599">such an admirable job sort of describing</text><text start="785.279" dur="3.481">collective intelligence in a specific</text><text start="786.779" dur="3.901">context I&apos;m going to just zoom way out</text><text start="788.76" dur="4.44">and say you know</text><text start="790.68" dur="4.02">why collective intelligence there&apos;s</text><text start="793.2" dur="2.879">something that feels inherently good</text><text start="794.7" dur="3.78">about it I mean we want to be</text><text start="796.079" dur="5.301">intelligence and we we like collectives</text><text start="798.48" dur="5.34">but I think to me what is separately</text><text start="801.38" dur="4.18">powerful about the concept of collective</text><text start="803.82" dur="4.579">intelligence is that it does something</text><text start="805.56" dur="5.399">that nothing else can do which is</text><text start="808.399" dur="4.781">aggregate everyone&apos;s unique insights and</text><text start="810.959" dur="4.861">perspectives in such a way that they are</text><text start="813.18" dur="5.159">actionable so not everything that anyone</text><text start="815.82" dur="4.319">does together it functions as collective</text><text start="818.339" dur="3.36">intelligence I think we look at things</text><text start="820.139" dur="4.081">like markets and democracy and even</text><text start="821.699" dur="4.561">bureaucracy as interesting examples of</text><text start="824.22" dur="3.72">something that is somewhat efficacious</text><text start="826.26" dur="4.259">as collective intelligence because</text><text start="827.94" dur="4.32">people talking together is not on its</text><text start="830.519" dur="4.5">own collective intelligence right there</text><text start="832.26" dur="4.74">it&apos;s it&apos;s a substrate for it but then</text><text start="835.019" dur="3.661">you need to structure that in such a way</text><text start="837.0" dur="3.959">that you end up with outputs that are</text><text start="838.68" dur="3.659">usable and get you somewhere and so I</text><text start="840.959" dur="3.06">think when we think about collective</text><text start="842.339" dur="4.86">intelligence or when I think about it in</text><text start="844.019" dur="4.62">in my research it is about what is the</text><text start="847.199" dur="3.661">best way to do that structure without</text><text start="848.639" dur="3.841">losing the collectivity of it because if</text><text start="850.86" dur="3.18">you over structure something as we&apos;ve</text><text start="852.48" dur="3.24">seen across democracy and markets and</text><text start="854.04" dur="3.479">bureaucracies then it&apos;s no longer</text><text start="855.72" dur="4.08">collective intelligence you&apos;ve gone too</text><text start="857.519" dur="4.141">far in One Direction right and so I</text><text start="859.8" dur="4.08">think even if we Zoom all the way into</text><text start="861.66" dur="4.44">something like versus we are incredibly</text><text start="863.88" dur="4.199">emergent as an organization and so</text><text start="866.1" dur="3.419">having too much structure kind of kills</text><text start="868.079" dur="3.241">that emergence and then what are we</text><text start="869.519" dur="3.901">doing but having too little structure</text><text start="871.32" dur="5.4">means that there&apos;s no way through which</text><text start="873.42" dur="4.74">we can you know funnel our actions and</text><text start="876.72" dur="3.179">get to somewhere Collective and I think</text><text start="878.16" dur="3.84">Bitcoin is an incredible example of that</text><text start="879.899" dur="4.201">I mean it&apos;s always a tension between how</text><text start="882.0" dur="4.56">much structure you put in and how much</text><text start="884.1" dur="5.099">community building and emergence that</text><text start="886.56" dur="4.38">you enable uh and that&apos;s really a core</text><text start="889.199" dur="3.781">of also the mechanisms that we work on a</text><text start="890.94" dur="3.48">radical exchange and digital democracy</text><text start="892.98" dur="4.38">more broadly because at the end of the</text><text start="894.42" dur="4.74">day your execution arm has to be</text><text start="897.36" dur="5.039">somewhat expert focused it&apos;s somewhat</text><text start="899.16" dur="4.619">institutional right pandemics say Taiwan</text><text start="902.399" dur="2.341">did an incredible job with pandemics and</text><text start="903.779" dur="2.641">I think it&apos;s a great example of</text><text start="904.74" dur="2.88">collective intelligence and that&apos;s</text><text start="906.42" dur="3.3">because they use the collective</text><text start="907.62" dur="4.56">intelligence mechanisms to define the</text><text start="909.72" dur="3.84">problem to Source Solutions and then</text><text start="912.18" dur="3.18">they routed those Solutions through</text><text start="913.56" dur="3.3">experts and institutions it&apos;s not the</text><text start="915.36" dur="4.02">case that collective intelligence ran</text><text start="916.86" dur="4.919">the day end to end and really figuring</text><text start="919.38" dur="4.86">out at what points in a governance</text><text start="921.779" dur="4.201">process you can best leverage collective</text><text start="924.24" dur="3.42">intelligence and when to separate a</text><text start="925.98" dur="4.38">mechanism in an institution like I think</text><text start="927.66" dur="5.88">we are experiencing small examples of</text><text start="930.36" dur="4.56">that across all of our work every day</text><text start="933.54" dur="3.239">and I think there&apos;s such a large</text><text start="934.92" dur="4.979">opportunity to be working on this</text><text start="936.779" dur="4.92">problem right now because we&apos;ve got a</text><text start="939.899" dur="3.481">Global Communication System that has</text><text start="941.699" dur="3.361">reached maturity over the last 30 years</text><text start="943.38" dur="3.72">and then we&apos;ve also got these nascent</text><text start="945.06" dur="3.839">governance tools that allow us to really</text><text start="947.1" dur="3.419">configure the way these collective</text><text start="948.899" dur="3.421">intelligence systems are built and it</text><text start="950.519" dur="3.901">seems feels like an existential question</text><text start="952.32" dur="4.34">for the 21st century what you&apos;re working</text><text start="954.42" dur="2.24">on</text><text start="957.019" dur="3.581">I certainly think so and same to you</text><text start="959.579" dur="2.82">yeah</text><text start="960.6" dur="3.12">um so how do we you know like say I&apos;m a</text><text start="962.399" dur="2.461">project maintainer I guess I am a</text><text start="963.72" dur="4.02">project maintainer that&apos;s trying to</text><text start="964.86" dur="5.7">balance uh I love how you use the word</text><text start="967.74" dur="4.68">pre-figuration so presets and</text><text start="970.56" dur="3.839">configuration are two different ways</text><text start="972.42" dur="3.96">presets mean are like don&apos;t let don&apos;t</text><text start="974.399" dur="3.901">make me think and configuration is give</text><text start="976.38" dur="3.42">me all of the options in the world and</text><text start="978.3" dur="2.94">like you know how do I how do I balance</text><text start="979.8" dur="3.779">that as a Founder do I build for</text><text start="981.24" dur="4.38">convention or configuration are there</text><text start="983.579" dur="3.661">any sort of tips that you&apos;ve that you&apos;ve</text><text start="985.62" dur="2.82">learned to know I imagine it&apos;s like</text><text start="987.24" dur="3.3">almost like a rubber band where you can</text><text start="988.44" dur="3.66">stretch it in one way or another like uh</text><text start="990.54" dur="3.719">and then it breaks if you get too far in</text><text start="992.1" dur="4.08">One Direction how do I know exactly</text><text start="994.259" dur="3.061">where I stand if I&apos;m a Founder working</text><text start="996.18" dur="3.719">in the space</text><text start="997.32" dur="5.519">yeah I think this is as I said before</text><text start="999.899" dur="6.421">it&apos;s a dance basically right and one of</text><text start="1002.839" dur="7.74">the most instructive things that</text><text start="1006.32" dur="6.6">can be brought into that dance to me are</text><text start="1010.579" dur="3.481">what are the types of and maybe this is</text><text start="1012.92" dur="3.719">just switching the question what are the</text><text start="1014.06" dur="4.5">types of configurations that can be</text><text start="1016.639" dur="3.661">pre-figurative over time Progressive</text><text start="1018.56" dur="3.839">decentralization for example let&apos;s say</text><text start="1020.3" dur="4.8">quite specifically like that is</text><text start="1022.399" dur="5.221">something where you have the process is</text><text start="1025.1" dur="4.62">as pre-figurative as the outcome</text><text start="1027.62" dur="4.559">um you want to get to a place where</text><text start="1029.72" dur="4.8">you&apos;re building for Community agency and</text><text start="1032.179" dur="4.02">you recognize that structure is required</text><text start="1034.52" dur="3.72">to get there and structure means that</text><text start="1036.199" dur="3.421">you don&apos;t start out in that place and in</text><text start="1038.24" dur="3.599">fact if you did start out in that place</text><text start="1039.62" dur="4.26">you would never get to your outcome and</text><text start="1041.839" dur="3.72">so instead of setting up a prefigurative</text><text start="1043.88" dur="4.14">outcome you set up a pre-figurative</text><text start="1045.559" dur="4.86">process and then you progressively</text><text start="1048.02" dur="4.98">decentralize uh and I think this is</text><text start="1050.419" dur="4.801">something it&apos;s dicey right because you</text><text start="1053.0" dur="5.58">may end up not decentralizing that&apos;s the</text><text start="1055.22" dur="5.4">the problem but I think it is probably</text><text start="1058.58" dur="5.16">better than setting something up that is</text><text start="1060.62" dur="5.64">you know decentralized on its face but</text><text start="1063.74" dur="4.16">in practice is fairly structured it&apos;s</text><text start="1066.26" dur="4.02">the Tyranny structuralist</text><text start="1067.9" dur="4.3">structurelessness problem</text><text start="1070.28" dur="3.6">um and then you can&apos;t progressively</text><text start="1072.2" dur="4.5">decentralize because you haven&apos;t put in</text><text start="1073.88" dur="4.2">place any progress over time you think</text><text start="1076.7" dur="4.14">that you&apos;re starting out exactly where</text><text start="1078.08" dur="5.04">you want to end up so I think that kind</text><text start="1080.84" dur="4.32">of mechanism of process can be as</text><text start="1083.12" dur="3.84">pre-figurative as outcome</text><text start="1085.16" dur="3.18">got it okay kind of reminds me of</text><text start="1086.96" dur="3.42">italics</text><text start="1088.34" dur="3.959">um article about legitimacy which is the</text><text start="1090.38" dur="3.72">higher high order social acceptance of a</text><text start="1092.299" dur="3.481">system and there&apos;s multiple ways to get</text><text

heard in your</text><text start="1100.039" dur="3.421">answer</text><text start="1101.299" dur="5.221">um that the process can be a way of of</text><text start="1103.46" dur="5.579">kind of like walking the line of uh of</text><text start="1106.52" dur="5.22">progressively decentralizing</text><text start="1109.039" dur="5.041">yeah and I think it&apos;s it&apos;s a question of</text><text start="1111.74" dur="5.16">also I mean practically</text><text start="1114.08" dur="4.32">what are you decentralizing to words and</text><text start="1116.9" dur="3.6">who are the people that you&apos;re trying to</text><text start="1118.4" dur="3.48">serve and are they best served by the</text><text start="1120.5" dur="4.5">form of decentralization that you&apos;ve</text><text start="1121.88" dur="4.98">chosen I mean I think that this is take</text><text start="1125.0" dur="4.14">something like labor unions for example</text><text start="1126.86" dur="4.559">they&apos;re not decentralized right I mean</text><text start="1129.14" dur="4.38">in fact the idea is that you take a</text><text start="1131.419" dur="4.441">bunch of autonomous individuals and you</text><text start="1133.52" dur="5.82">create something Collective out of them</text><text start="1135.86" dur="5.819">and in doing that you lose one form of</text><text start="1139.34" dur="4.44">decentralization which is the fact that</text><text start="1141.679" dur="4.261">they are acting autonomously and</text><text start="1143.78" dur="3.66">suddenly you are you&apos;re

we call</text><text start="1321.26" dur="4.74">redundancy distributed Ledger technology</text><text start="1323.36" dur="3.6">can be decentralized via redundancy and</text><text start="1326.0" dur="4.46">that was created for security</text><text start="1326.96" dur="5.4">constraints but in many types of actual</text><text start="1330.46" dur="4.12">Technologies and outcomes that we

dur="3.541">to achieve all of the purported benefits</text><text start="1338.539" dur="3.481">of decentralization so if we take</text><text start="1340.22" dur="4.439">something like data</text><text start="1342.02" dur="4.86">um what is the way that data interacts</text><text start="1344.659" dur="4.38">with global redundancy well we already</text><text start="1346.88" dur="3.299">know it&apos;s incredibly inefficient in a</text><text start="1349.039" dur="3.901">lot of different ways it&apos;s basically</text><text start="1350.179" dur="4.38">operating at the speed of distrust which</text><text start="1352.94" dur="3.18">isn&apos;t the speed at which we normally</text><text start="1354.559" dur="2.821">like to operate and it&apos;s not the most</text><text start="1356.12" dur="3.0">efficient speed at which we operate</text><text start="1357.38" dur="3.179">which is why everything from companies</text><text start="1359.12" dur="3.0">nonprofits they spend so much time</text><text start="1360.559" dur="3.301">building trust so they can work better</text><text start="1362.12" dur="3.78">right and so why are we trying to</text><text start="1363.86" dur="4.02">operate the speed of distrust when</text><text start="1365.9" dur="4.38">instead the type of decentralization we</text><text start="1367.88" dur="5.159">want is something like subsidiarities so</text><text start="1370.28" dur="6.36">to Define subsidiarity it is essentially</text><text start="1373.039" dur="5.401">local autonomy as much as possible and</text><text start="1376.64" dur="4.38">then scale through Federation because</text><text start="1378.44" dur="5.04">you need scale problems we have at scale</text><text start="1381.02" dur="4.92">um you can&apos;t just have localism you also</text><text start="1383.48" dur="4.38">need to get to solving Global challenges</text><text start="1385.94" dur="3.42">through local communities interacting in</text><text start="1387.86" dur="3.78">incredibly strong</text><text start="1389.36" dur="4.14">um and successful ways and so I think</text><text start="1391.64" dur="3.419">when we go back to the example of data</text><text start="1393.5" dur="4.14">well instead of something that is</text><text start="1395.059" dur="4.381">redundant and you know is on one hand</text><text start="1397.64" dur="3.659">highly private private ownership of data</text><text start="1399.44" dur="3.3">and on the other hand highly public in</text><text start="1401.299" dur="4.141">terms of the way that data is stored</text><text start="1402.74" dur="4.559">what if we had subsidiarity where people</text><text start="1405.44" dur="3.66">could pool data it could be much more</text><text start="1407.299" dur="3.24">productive because lots of different</text><text start="1409.1" dur="3.959">types of Technologies could have access</text><text start="1410.539" dur="4.561">to that data through scale but you still</text><text start="1413.059" dur="3.48">have local control over the structure of</text><text start="1415.1" dur="3.059">the right system the network structure</text><text start="1416.539" dur="2.64">that comes to mind for me and this may</text><text start="1418.159" dur="3.481">be</text><text start="1419.179" dur="4.5">not a good one uh I&apos;ll be curious here</text><text start="1421.64" dur="4.44">for your feedback is the the layer two</text><text start="1423.679" dur="4.261">scaling strategy for the ethereum</text><text start="1426.08" dur="3.959">network where instead of just putting</text><text start="1427.94" dur="4.02">more power into the base layer we&apos;ve got</text><text start="1430.039" dur="4.081">these like subsidiary networks layer</text><text start="1431.96" dur="3.9">twos that are actually have localized</text><text start="1434.12" dur="3.48">and then you just roll back up to the</text><text start="1435.86" dur="3.9">Federated structure is that an example</text><text start="1437.6" dur="4.92">of subsidiary I&apos;m not even saying the</text><text start="1439.76" dur="4.799">word right subsidiarity</text><text start="1442.52" dur="4.139">yeah I think it&apos;s actually a really</text><text start="1444.559" dur="3.901">interesting example um that vitalik has</text><text start="1446.659" dur="3.601">even named as</text><text start="1448.46" dur="3.599">um his intention has been you know you</text><text start="1450.26" dur="4.14">keep the base layer extremely neutral</text><text start="1452.059" dur="5.0">and that allows for people to build more</text><text start="1454.4" dur="4.5">experiments on top and do things such as</text><text start="1457.059" dur="4.661">retroactive public goods funding</text><text start="1458.9" dur="5.399">Democratic voting systems and and by</text><text start="1461.72" dur="4.38">Nature like the the base layer remains</text><text start="1464.299" dur="3.601">extremely architecturally decentralized</text><text start="1466.1" dur="2.88">so that it allows these other centers to</text><text start="1467.9" dur="3.48">emerge</text><text start="1468.98" dur="4.799">um which feels like the kind of the same</text><text start="1471.38" dur="5.22">the same thing happening with um right</text><text start="1473.779" dur="5.041">Federation subsidiarity but also there&apos;s</text><text start="1476.6" dur="3.72">a saying that you know you when you</text><text start="1478.82" dur="3.12">decentralize things like power</text><text start="1480.32" dur="3.359">accumulates in a different place and</text><text start="1481.94" dur="3.839">centralization happens somewhere else</text><text start="1483.679" dur="3.961">and so the question is like when you</text><text start="1485.779" dur="3.541">decentralize something does that</text><text start="1487.64" dur="5.12">recentralize all the power in one place</text><text start="1489.32" dur="5.88">or does it allow this like ecosystem of</text><text start="1492.76" dur="4.659">flourishing Alternatives that&apos;s like</text><text start="1495.2" dur="4.68">pluralistic to emerge</text><text start="1497.419" dur="5.041">so L2 is definitely a very</text><text start="1499.88" dur="3.659">um solid kind of example of that yeah</text><text start="1502.46" dur="3.12">totally and that&apos;s such an excellent</text><text start="1503.539" dur="5.101">point about the layer twos because of</text><text start="1505.58" dur="5.52">their local agency have the ability to</text><text start="1508.64" dur="4.56">focus on things that aren&apos;t a fit for</text><text start="1511.1" dur="3.72">the credibly neutral bass layer uh it</text><text start="1513.2" dur="3.479">kind of reminds me of the 50 states in</text><text start="1514.82" dur="4.26">the United States like how they&apos;re kind</text><text start="1516.679" dur="4.86">of little Laboratories of democracy and</text><text start="1519.08" dur="3.66">then if well in theory if things work</text><text start="1521.539" dur="3.541">out at the state level they could be</text><text start="1522.74" dur="4.559">implemented at the federal level so uh</text><text start="1525.08" dur="4.56">once you&apos;ve opened up my ideas to this</text><text start="1527.299" dur="3.781">idea of subsidiarity decentralization</text><text start="1529.64" dur="3.659">I&apos;m starting to kind of see it in a</text><text start="1531.08" dur="4.14">bunch of different places what are the</text><text start="1533.299" dur="4.38">most promising models of subsidiarity</text><text start="1535.22" dur="3.78">that that y&apos;all are excited about I</text><text start="1537.679" dur="2.521">think that there are a bunch of</text><text start="1539.0" dur="3.72">different substrates on which I&apos;m</text><text start="1540.2" dur="4.38">excited about subsidiarity so one when</text><text start="1542.72" dur="3.18">you say you see it everywhere I think</text><text start="1544.58" dur="3.42">that&apos;s an inherent property of</text><text start="1545.9" dur="3.42">decentralization by subsidiary in the</text><text start="1548.0" dur="4.14">sense that</text><text start="1549.32" dur="5.4">look fully decentralized systems where</text><text start="1552.14" dur="4.62">Everyone&apos;s atomized an individual just</text><text start="1554.72" dur="3.839">will not go on I mean that&apos;s not a</text><text start="1556.76" dur="3.659">stable state for an ecosystem right</text><text start="1558.559" dur="3.781">people will come together they&apos;re start</text><text start="1560.419" dur="4.801">to farm collectives like that type of</text><text start="1562.34" dur="4.8">decentralization is just it&apos;s it&apos;s not</text><text start="1565.22" dur="3.9">the way that humans are and it&apos;s not a</text><text start="1567.14" dur="4.139">stable State on the other hand pure</text><text start="1569.12" dur="4.74">centralization is also a highly unstable</text><text start="1571.279" dur="4.5">State because you can&apos;t actually operate</text><text start="1573.86" dur="3.419">a totally top-down organization in</text><text start="1575.779" dur="3.481">reality the world&apos;s too complicated</text><text start="1577.279" dur="3.9">people can&apos;t be instructed perfectly</text><text start="1579.26" dur="3.12">like you&apos;re going to do some sort of</text><text start="1581.179" dur="2.641">federation</text><text start="1582.38" dur="3.96">um you&apos;re going to decentralize in some</text><text start="1583.82" dur="4.38">ways and so I think most of what we</text><text start="1586.34" dur="3.839">actually have in the world is just</text><text start="1588.2" dur="3.9">trying to navigate this tension without</text><text start="1590.179" dur="3.36">being explicit about it and some</text><text start="1592.1" dur="3.84">organizations do better than others I</text><text start="1593.539" dur="5.221">mean let&apos;s take like a very old company</text><text start="1595.94" dur="4.739">for example this a lot of reasons that</text><text start="1598.76" dur="3.779">old companies get disrupted is because</text><text start="1600.679" dur="3.901">they can&apos;t move quickly and I think this</text><text start="1602.539" dur="3.601">is a lack of collective intelligence at</text><text start="1604.58" dur="3.12">the corporation level I mean it&apos;s the</text><text start="1606.14" dur="3.72">fact that they didn&apos;t succeed at</text><text start="1607.7" dur="3.359">subsidiarity small agile team couldn&apos;t</text><text start="1609.86" dur="2.58">move as quickly as they could they</text><text start="1611.059" dur="2.701">couldn&apos;t do new things they couldn&apos;t</text><text start="1612.44" dur="3.119">Federate those new things up to the</text><text start="1613.76" dur="3.72">large level and now suddenly you&apos;re</text><text start="1615.559" dur="3.301">disrupted right and so on the flip side</text><text start="1617.48" dur="4.199">what are exciting examples of</text><text start="1618.86" dur="4.14">subsidiarity I mean to me uh this is one</text><text start="1621.679" dur="4.201">of the reasons that I think does are</text><text start="1623.0" dur="5.4">really cool because instead of trying to</text><text start="1625.88" dur="4.86">be entire entities in and of themselves</text><text start="1628.4" dur="4.92">you see a lot of coordination between</text><text start="1630.74" dur="5.16">Dows to accomplish things together which</text><text start="1633.32" dur="4.2">it&apos;s not yet as structured in some ways</text><text start="1635.9" dur="3.3">as I would like it I think it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="1637.52" dur="4.08">tending more to the decentralization</text><text start="1639.2" dur="4.92">side and less to the subsidiarity side</text><text start="1641.6" dur="3.9">but there is a necessity of subsidiary</text><text start="1644.12" dur="3.24">that is emerging I mean people are</text><text start="1645.5" dur="3.24">already like sub-dials for example well</text><text start="1647.36" dur="2.939">why is that coming up because it&apos;s</text><text start="1648.74" dur="3.659">difficult to run an organization without</text><text start="1650.299" dur="4.801">that and so let&apos;s do that intentionally</text><text start="1652.399" dur="4.081">and on purpose and I think identity is a</text><text start="1655.1" dur="2.819">really interesting place to start</text><text start="1656.48" dur="3.54">thinking about this because identity</text><text start="1657.919" dur="4.38">Solutions you know we sort of started</text><text start="1660.02" dur="4.92">out in the technology technology space</text><text start="1662.299" dur="5.281">on one hand by wanting totally Universal</text><text start="1664.94" dur="4.739">identity Solutions everyone has a public</text><text start="1667.58" dur="3.66">and a private key or everyone has the</text><text start="1669.679" dur="3.72">same biometric solution or whatever</text><text start="1671.24" dur="4.679">right you want something that works for</text><text start="1673.399" dur="4.38">everyone and we&apos;re realizing that&apos;s not</text><text start="1675.919" dur="3.661">how humans have ever done identity</text><text start="1677.779" dur="4.201">that&apos;s not what it means to actually</text><text start="1679.58" dur="4.86">operate with an identity in the world</text><text

dur="3.299">that</text><text start="2011.919" dur="3.48">um you know I&apos;ve been reading Lewis</text><text start="2013.779" dur="3.78">Mumford recently and his work on</text><text start="2015.399" dur="4.921">authoritarian and Democratic techniques</text><text start="2017.559" dur="5.641">and sort of this idea that there is an</text><text start="2020.32" dur="4.68">inherent kind of technology

dur="5.579">democracy as nation-state Concepts right</text><text start="2038.14" dur="4.68">uh for example things that are in the</text><text start="2041.019" dur="3.121">U.S tech ecosystem are

dur="4.14">authoritarian but in reality I think</text><text start="2049.419" dur="6.301">those are the types of Concepts that can</text><text start="2051.28" dur="7.5">be applied to small-scale subunits very</text><text start="2055.72" dur="4.439">productively and therefore the stakes of</text><text start="2058.78" dur="4.139">something like collective intelligence</text><text start="2060.159" dur="4.68">are both normative in the sense that you</text><text start="2062.919" dur="4.081">know we want to build for democracy</text><text start="2064.839" dur="4.74">because we believe that it is just but</text><text start="2067.0" dur="4.44">there also there&apos;s a stake in</text><text start="2069.579" dur="3.661">building good collective intelligence</text><text start="2071.44" dur="3.419">systems to prove the case for a</text><text start="2073.24" dur="3.659">democracy such that that&apos;s the direction</text><text start="2074.859" dur="4.26">in which we build</text><text start="2076.899" dur="5.341">um and I feel that</text><text start="2079.119" dur="5.821">that to me is the core of why we do this</text><text start="2082.24" dur="5.399">work because we not only want to say you</text><text start="2084.94" dur="5.04">know these are good things to do but</text><text start="2087.639" dur="4.321">also let&apos;s make these the most

dur="4.2">and so I think for all of these</text><text start="2095.74" dur="4.44">different parts of it that I&apos;ve been</text><text start="2097.599" dur="4.26">advocating on whether it&apos;s Identity or</text><text start="2100.18" dur="4.38">you know data transfer and data</text><text start="2101.859" dur="5.701">ownership or organizational innovation</text><text start="2104.56" dur="5.4">it&apos;s the idea to constantly be making</text><text start="2107.56" dur="5.519">the collective intelligence work better</text><text start="2109.96" dur="4.92">than other types of solutions and so for</text><text start="2113.079" dur="4.441">identity it&apos;s really important to say</text><text start="2114.88" dur="5.28">we&apos;re not giving something up in terms</text><text start="2117.52" dur="4.92">of ability to use the system ease of use</text><text start="2120.16" dur="4.14">you know scale through Federation growth</text><text start="2122.44" dur="4.32">all of those kinds of things because</text><text start="2124.3" dur="4.62">we&apos;ve chosen a democratic approach</text><text start="2126.76" dur="3.42">instead we are building something that</text><text start="2128.92" dur="3.06">will solve the problems of the world</text><text start="2130.18" dur="3.96">much better</text><text start="2131.98" dur="3.9">um and one of my kind of core examples</text><text start="2134.14" dur="3.12">of this when I was in India I interacted</text><text start="2135.88" dur="3.18">a lot and sort of worked on the fringes</text><text start="2137.26" dur="4.14">of centralized identity system like</text><text start="2139.06" dur="4.44">athod and I think this is an incredibly</text><text start="2141.4" dur="3.719">concerning project to me</text><text start="2143.5" dur="3.359">um and if for folks who aren&apos;t familiar</text><text start="2145.119" dur="3.661">you know it&apos;s biometric identity for</text><text start="2146.859" dur="3.841">every citizen it&apos;s basically required</text><text start="2148.78" dur="4.62">for a lot of interactions most</text><text start="2150.7" dur="4.5">interactions at all with the state and</text><text start="2153.4" dur="3.24">you know a lot of critics of adad will</text><text start="2155.2" dur="4.44">point to the fact that it&apos;s used to</text><text start="2156.64" dur="4.62">track people uh of different religions</text><text start="2159.64" dur="3.12">um it has major privacy issues because</text><text start="2161.26" dur="3.68">it&apos;s stored totally centrally and all of</text><text start="2162.76" dur="5.16">that but to me the real core</text><text start="2164.94" dur="4.72">issue is something that is it&apos;s a</text><text start="2167.92" dur="3.12">concentration of power issue that that</text><text start="2169.66" dur="3.36">results in all of these other things</text><text start="2171.04" dur="4.559">right but critics sometimes miss the</text><text start="2173.02" dur="4.02">fact that adad works in some cases like</text><text start="2175.599" dur="3.48">we have to we have to be able to</text><text start="2177.04" dur="3.78">vocalize that it is useful for people to</text><text start="2179.079" dur="3.421">have identities it&apos;s useful for people</text><text start="2180.82" dur="3.12">to be able to interact directly with the</text><text start="2182.5" dur="3.18">government in certain ways it&apos;s useful</text><text start="2183.94" dur="3.86">for Direct Cash transfers to be possible</text><text start="2185.68" dur="3.72">when they weren&apos;t possible before it has</text><text start="2187.8" dur="4.12">disintermediated some forms of</text><text start="2189.4" dur="4.26">corruption right it&apos;s not all bad and so</text><text start="2191.92" dur="3.3">if we&apos;re going to try to criticize and</text><text start="2193.66" dur="2.939">be better than systems like that and on</text><text start="2195.22" dur="3.72">that I think is just an example of the</text><text start="2196.599" dur="4.26">type of system that exists in many</text><text start="2198.94" dur="4.679">different places across the world then</text><text start="2200.859" dur="4.5">our alternative has to have the pros has</text><text start="2203.619" dur="4.5">to be able to do those kind of things</text><text start="2205.359" dur="6.121">and not have the cons and so I think</text><text start="2208.119" dur="5.281">that is the the task of people who are</text><text start="2211.48" dur="5.04">in the space and and what I see is as my</text><text start="2213.4" dur="5.88">task in our task is to prove that point</text><text start="2216.52" dur="5.339">through efficacy as well as through what</text><text start="2219.28" dur="4.559">we think is just amazing Raymond</text><text start="2221.859" dur="3.901">anything to add</text><text start="2223.839" dur="3.961">um yeah I think Divi and I definitely</text><text start="2225.76" dur="4.14">both come to this space with uh this</text><text start="2227.8" dur="4.5">like spirit and natural interest in</text><text start="2229.9" dur="5.64">democracy and pluralism that like this</text><text start="2232.3" dur="6.36">feels like it has the right Vibes for us</text><text start="2235.54" dur="4.74">um but it&apos;s hard to advocate for any</text><text start="2238.66" dur="4.8">kind of ideology that way even if it is</text><text start="2240.28" dur="5.579">democracy and when we when we are doing</text><text start="2243.46" dur="4.2">what I&apos;ve been involved in projects like</text><text start="2245.859" dur="3.661">designing the governance for a Dao or</text><text start="2247.66" dur="3.0">even just like introducing the concept</text><text start="2249.52" dur="2.819">of governance</text><text start="2250.66" dur="4.04">it&apos;s definitely</text><text start="2252.339" dur="4.74">um very hard to approach these things</text><text start="2254.7" dur="4.0">directly and</text><text start="2257.079" dur="2.881">that&apos;s why we have to think about we</text><text start="2258.7" dur="2.58">have to think of all these mechanisms</text><text start="2259.96" dur="2.94">and even like the concept of</text><text start="2261.28" dur="3.42">generalizing this to collective</text><text start="2262.9" dur="4.199">intelligence to turn into something that</text><text start="2264.7" dur="4.02">is like appealing and useful for people</text><text start="2267.099" dur="2.221">um and I think it&apos;s only going to be you</text><text start="2268.72" dur="2.7">know</text><text start="2269.32" dur="4.38">when we have really evolved tools and</text><text start="2271.42" dur="4.199">prototypes and and pre-figurative</text><text start="2273.7" dur="3.659">artifacts out there that people can</text><text start="2275.619" dur="3.121">experiment with and say like actually</text><text start="2277.359" dur="3.48">this is something that that would be</text><text start="2278.74" dur="4.02">really nice for my organization or the</text><text start="2280.839" dur="3.901">way that I designed my protocol to like</text><text start="2282.76" dur="3.599">use this identity system as opposed to</text><text start="2284.74" dur="3.42">something that that keeps everything on</text><text start="2286.359" dur="3.301">chain and in public</text><text start="2288.16" dur="2.76">um it&apos;s only when we get there and that</text><text start="2289.66" dur="4.02">the solutions are very appealing to</text><text start="2290.92" dur="4.32">people that will know that um this is</text><text start="2293.68" dur="3.659">something that can stick around</text><text start="2295.24" dur="4.619">because we&apos;re definitely we&apos;re in the</text><text start="2297.339" dur="4.981">very early days of um of this</text><text start="2299.859" dur="4.74">decentralization and watching how Tech</text><text start="2302.32" dur="4.259">has evolved over the last 20 years you</text><text start="2304.599" dur="4.821">know there&apos;s a lot of people who see</text><text start="2306.579" dur="5.341">Echoes of early sentiment around</text><text start="2309.42" dur="5.38">crowdsourcing and Wikipedia and all</text><text start="2311.92" dur="3.96">these information systems and they saw</text><text start="2314.8" dur="2.88">that a lot of that ended up quite</text><text start="2315.88" dur="4.32">centralized in the end</text><text start="2317.68" dur="4.38">yeah I think so I guess I&apos;m wondering</text><text start="2320.2" dur="3.48">you know what is maximum collective</text><text start="2322.06" dur="3.48">intelligence look like like what is</text><text start="2323.68" dur="4.74">maximum coordination Play Play It</text><text start="2325.54" dur="6.36">Forward 10 years and tell me what you</text><text start="2328.42" dur="6.48">know what we could see in the year 2032</text><text start="2331.9" dur="4.679">if we if we maximum or maximize our</text><text start="2334.9" dur="3.959">ability to create coordination and</text><text start="2336.579" dur="4.921">collective intelligence at scale like</text><text start="2338.859" dur="4.26">can you take me into that future</text><text start="2341.5" dur="3.9">I think I think it kind of looks like</text><text start="2343.119" dur="4.921">Good Vibes it looks like um</text><text start="2345.4" dur="5.16">people being in you know in in harmony</text><text start="2348.04" dur="5.579">with the the computer systems that are</text><text start="2350.56" dur="6.299">using um and the IT connecting people to</text><text start="2353.619" dur="5.641">other people around them it feels like</text><text start="2356.859" dur="3.48">it&apos;s the opposite of atomization in a</text><text start="2359.26" dur="3.66">lot of ways</text><text start="2360.339" dur="3.481">yeah I think that&apos;s right and I think</text><text start="2362.92" dur="4.14">that</text><text start="2363.82" dur="4.799">I mean let&apos;s take its sort of</text><text start="2367.06" dur="3.539">the interactions that we have day-to-day</text><text start="2368.619" dur="4.681">right like who makes decisions over me</text><text start="2370.599" dur="5.24">well uh my workplace</text><text start="2373.3" dur="5.22">um probably my government uh probably</text><text start="2375.839" dur="5.081">some measure of like the people who are</text><text start="2378.52" dur="5.04">around me in local space have some voice</text><text start="2380.92" dur="4.919">in my life uh my family and friends I</text><text start="2383.56" dur="4.5">mean all of these kinds of places in</text><text start="2385.839" dur="3.601">which decision making happens and then</text><text start="2388.06" dur="3.12">there&apos;s a lot of decision making I have</text><text start="2389.44" dur="3.54">so little control over right like U.S</text><text start="2391.18" dur="3.659">foreign policy what&apos;s going on at the UN</text><text start="2392.98" dur="3.3">I mean these are things that are going</text><text start="2394.839" dur="5.041">to happen in our collective intelligence</text><text start="2396.28" dur="5.04">world still and we don&apos;t want to have</text><text start="2399.88" dur="3.0">maximum coordination in the sense that</text><text start="2401.32" dur="4.019">we get rid of Institutions and replace</text><text start="2402.88" dur="3.959">them with some form of emergence so what</text><text start="2405.339" dur="2.76">are the best ways what are the best</text><text start="2406.839" dur="3.361">institutions that can best funnel</text><text start="2408.099" dur="3.601">collective intelligence is what we will</text><text start="2410.2" dur="3.119">have in the maximum collective</text><text start="2411.7" dur="3.96">intelligence world I think and so that</text><text start="2413.319" dur="5.76">will look like you know doing types of</text><text start="2415.66" dur="5.1">work that are we we know are needed for</text><text start="2419.079" dur="3.601">by the community where the community can</text><text start="2420.76" dur="3.54">be local or Global or distributed or</text><text start="2422.68" dur="3.54">anywhere in between there is a way to</text><text start="2424.3" dur="4.08">figure out what types of work what types</text><text start="2426.22" dur="3.84">of resources are are generally required</text><text start="2428.38" dur="3.84">and a way to plug into that and to</text><text start="2430.06" dur="3.9">provide those resources like that type</text><text start="2432.22" dur="3.42">of end-to-end mechanism which is sort of</text><text start="2433.96" dur="3.48">What markets are supposed to do right I</text><text start="2435.64" dur="3.479">mean at the end of the day that is</text><text start="2437.44" dur="3.48">something that sort of works it&apos;s not</text><text start="2439.119" dur="3.301">the case that the price mechanism hasn&apos;t</text><text start="2440.92" dur="4.32">succeeded at kind of doing that a</text><text start="2442.42" dur="4.32">defining need and filling that need but</text><text start="2445.24" dur="3.359">collective intelligence is better than</text><text start="2446.74" dur="3.48">markets and therefore you know it is</text><text start="2448.599" dur="3.301">markets but we we upgrade those</text><text start="2450.22" dur="3.96">mechanisms to allow for much more</text><text start="2451.9" dur="4.679">granular preference input then we can do</text><text start="2454.18" dur="4.679">a much better job of that that&apos;s also</text><text start="2456.579" dur="5.161">true on a more explicitly political side</text><text start="2458.859" dur="4.561">we can do a much better job of you know</text><text start="2461.74" dur="3.599">right now I should have some control</text><text start="2463.42" dur="3.659">over various types of decisions that are</text><text start="2465.339" dur="3.24">being made around me how do we make that</text><text start="2467.079" dur="4.321">control better and how do we make it</text><text start="2468.579" dur="4.861">such that it is institutionally defined</text><text start="2471.4" dur="4.38">in a way that I have exit in voice over</text><text start="2473.44" dur="3.899">institutions so right now I may have</text><text start="2475.78" dur="4.02">some institutions that I&apos;m familiar with</text><text start="2477.339" dur="4.561">say I&apos;m like a big fan of the ACLU or</text><text start="2479.8" dur="4.559">something well what does that mean for</text><text start="2481.9" dur="4.08">me personally very little they email me</text><text start="2484.359" dur="3.48">once in a while and ask for money and</text><text start="2485.98" dur="4.26">then that&apos;s most of my interaction with</text><text start="2487.839" dur="4.321">the ACLU what if there were much more</text><text start="2490.24" dur="3.78">responsive institutions that I could</text><text start="2492.16" dur="3.06">both have voice over in the sense that I</text><text start="2494.02" dur="3.42">meaningfully change the way that they</text><text start="2495.22" dur="4.02">acted and that I could exit from and</text><text start="2497.44" dur="3.659">move to other institutions so that I</text><text start="2499.24" dur="3.359">could vote with my feet as well like I</text><text start="2501.099" dur="3.781">think that is a part of the maximum</text><text start="2502.599" dur="3.781">collective intelligence world and there</text><text start="2504.88" dur="3.78">are a lot of pieces of this and this is</text><text start="2506.38" dur="5.52">true for political philosophies that are</text><text start="2508.66" dur="4.919">process oriented in nature that do have</text><text start="2511.9" dur="3.3">to come from us setting up good</text><text start="2513.579" dur="3.961">processes at the beginning but for me I</text><text start="2515.2" dur="4.139">think about this almost similar to</text><text start="2517.54" dur="2.88">growth compounding like economic growth</text><text start="2519.339" dur="3.181">compounding you know a one percent</text><text start="2520.42" dur="4.62">annual growth rate over 50 years is like</text><text start="2522.52" dur="5.099">64 growth and a five percent annual</text><text start="2525.04" dur="4.44">growth rate sorry 64 growth in 50 years</text><text start="2527.619" dur="5.101">I think and a five percent annual growth</text><text start="2529.48" dur="5.099">rate is like a thousand percent in in 50</text><text start="2532.72" dur="3.24">years I mean that&apos;s the difference that</text><text start="2534.579" dur="3.721">compounding can make for something like</text><text start="2535.96" dur="3.96">economic growth I think that&apos;s a similar</text><text start="2538.3" dur="2.94">type of difference that compounding can</text><text start="2539.92" dur="2.46">make for something like better decision</text><text start="2541.24" dur="3.24">making better governance better</text><text start="2542.38" dur="3.78">collective intelligence where right now</text><text start="2544.48" dur="3.72">even the types of things I can</text><text start="2546.16" dur="3.659">articulate are constrained we&apos;re nowhere</text><text start="2548.2" dur="4.32">near the best political economies we can</text><text start="2549.819" dur="4.561">have they&apos;re constrained but if I if I</text><text start="2552.52" dur="3.839">can get us to three percent annual</text><text start="2554.38" dur="4.62">growth on collective intelligence then</text><text start="2556.359" dur="4.381">boy in 50 years we&apos;ll have like 500</text><text start="2559.0" dur="3.3">percent better collective intelligence</text><text start="2560.74" dur="3.839">than we have now and I couldn&apos;t even</text><text start="2562.3" dur="4.98">imagine what that looks like and so I</text><text start="2564.579" dur="4.801">think you know while I have a world in</text><text start="2567.28" dur="4.559">mind I really think about that</text><text start="2569.38" dur="4.92">compounding as the layer in which you</text><text start="2571.839" dur="3.961">know differences can be made amazing I</text><text start="2574.3" dur="2.76">want to say back to you a couple of</text><text start="2575.8" dur="3.36">things that I heard and let me know if</text><text start="2577.06" dur="4.259">if I got it and this is also serves to</text><text start="2579.16" dur="4.8">hopefully summarize for the listeners so</text><text start="2581.319" dur="3.601">it sounds like by the way I just want to</text><text start="2583.96" dur="2.82">thank you for taking my question</text><text start="2584.92" dur="3.54">completely seriously I just asked you to</text><text start="2586.78" dur="2.94">reach 10 years into the future and tell</text><text start="2588.46" dur="3.3">me what it was going to be like which is</text><text start="2589.72" dur="3.78">a totally obnoxious question but I think</text><text start="2591.76" dur="3.42">it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s fun</text><text start="2593.5" dur="4.68">um so I think that we&apos;re trying to</text><text start="2595.18" dur="5.1">create coordination mechanisms that take</text><text start="2598.18" dur="4.02">what type of resources are required and</text><text start="2600.28" dur="5.039">get to those outputs of providing those</text><text start="2602.2" dur="6.06">resources and the opportunity with going</text><text start="2605.319" dur="4.26">for me the Industrial Age uh to the</text><text start="2608.26" dur="3.0">information age is that we can now get</text><text start="2609.579" dur="3.54">higher resolution data input into those</text><text start="2611.26" dur="3.66">systems you gave an example of like I</text><text start="2613.119" dur="3.301">think it was the ACLU emailing you once</text><text start="2614.92" dur="3.0">a month and like your only data input is</text><text start="2616.42" dur="3.899">like do they get do they get money from</text><text start="2617.92" dur="3.84">you or not but um the future high</text><text start="2620.319" dur="3.601">resolution data inputs are almost like</text><text start="2621.76" dur="3.66">with quadratic funding where we get 700</text><text start="2623.92" dur="2.88">000 data points about what an ecosystem</text><text start="2625.42" dur="4.02">cares about</text><text start="2626.8" dur="4.62">um in a quarter and a credibly neutral</text><text start="2629.44" dur="4.5">substrate to</text><text start="2631.42" dur="4.56">input those systems and within that</text><text start="2633.94" dur="4.26">credibly neutral substrate you have to</text><text start="2635.98" dur="4.92">have a balance of pre-figuration which</text><text start="2638.2" dur="4.139">is presets and configuration to allow</text><text start="2640.9" dur="4.56">people to still be able to input their</text><text start="2642.339" dur="5.221">preferences conveniently but to the the</text><text start="2645.46" dur="4.26">configuration bit comes in with the</text><text start="2647.56" dur="4.259">ability to express your preferences in</text><text start="2649.72" dur="4.92">all these different directions</text><text start="2651.819" dur="5.101">um and then I think that like the the</text><text start="2654.64" dur="3.959">right to exit is probably important at</text><text start="2656.92" dur="3.899">some point in there like to withdraw</text><text start="2658.599" dur="3.421">your consent from participating in these</text><text start="2660.819" dur="2.641">institutions I always think of</text><text start="2662.02" dur="2.819">Institutions maybe isn&apos;t even the right</text><text start="2663.46" dur="3.84">word like we&apos;re creating a coordination</text><text start="2664.839" dur="4.381">substrate and institutions feels like an</text><text start="2667.3" dur="3.72">industrial age word</text><text start="2669.22" dur="3.84">um and then the last thing I&apos;ll say is</text><text start="2671.02" dur="4.319">compounding coordination over time</text><text start="2673.06" dur="3.96">creates this sort of Event Horizon that</text><text start="2675.339" dur="3.301">we can&apos;t see over and that&apos;s why my</text><text start="2677.02" dur="3.72">question was so obnoxious to even ask</text><text start="2678.64" dur="3.959">you what this all looks like so that&apos;s</text><text start="2680.74" dur="3.599">me repeating back to you what I heard</text><text start="2682.599" dur="3.0">I&apos;m curious where I got that right where</text><text start="2684.339" dur="2.701">I got that wrong just trying to</text><text start="2685.599" dur="3.181">summarize it and put in other words for</text><text start="2687.04" dur="3.96">the for the listeners here</text><text start="2688.78" dur="4.98">yeah I mean I think that&apos;s a fabulous</text><text start="2691.0" dur="4.38">summary uh and possibly more coherent</text><text start="2693.76" dur="4.38">than the input so thank you for that</text><text start="2695.38" dur="4.739">collective intelligence in action</text><text start="2698.14" dur="4.979">um I like the idea of moving beyond</text><text start="2700.119" dur="4.921">institutions I think that you know</text><text start="2703.119" dur="4.021">my definition of institution is</text><text start="2705.04" dur="3.42">something like shared Norms processes</text><text start="2707.14" dur="4.62">and goals</text><text start="2708.46" dur="5.34">in an entity in a wrapper right and you</text><text start="2711.76" dur="4.02">know in an Ideal World we wouldn&apos;t use</text><text start="2713.8" dur="3.36">the word Institution for that because I</text><text start="2715.78" dur="3.96">think when you say the word institution</text><text start="2717.16" dur="6.54">what comes to mind is like old marble</text><text start="2719.74" dur="6.119">edifice maybe a Bank inside and so you</text><text start="2723.7" dur="5.82">know I think that shared Norms processes</text><text start="2725.859" dur="5.821">and goals are the type of structure that</text><text start="2729.52" dur="4.819">we want to keep building to get to this</text><text start="2731.68" dur="4.74">future we need a way through which</text><text start="2734.339" dur="4.901">coordination and collective intelligence</text><text start="2736.42" dur="4.199">can flow and I guess one of the reasons</text><text start="2739.24" dur="3.66">I use the word institutions is is</text><text start="2740.619" dur="3.601">because I sometimes become concerned</text><text start="2742.9" dur="2.58">about the fact that we want to move</text><text start="2744.22" dur="3.119">totally away from institutions and</text><text start="2745.48" dur="3.9">intermediaries and things like this so</text><text start="2747.339" dur="4.081">what we&apos;re building instead is still an</text><text start="2749.38" dur="3.959">institution like we can&apos;t get away from</text><text start="2751.42" dur="3.84">building institutions</text><text start="2753.339" dur="3.541">um and you know perhaps it&apos;s a language</text><text start="2755.26" dur="4.38">question but I think that it&apos;s important</text><text start="2756.88" dur="5.1">to reflect on the fact that we are</text><text start="2759.64" dur="3.9">building institutions whether we like it</text><text start="2761.98" dur="3.66">or not and so let&apos;s build good</text><text start="2763.54" dur="4.38">institutions on purpose</text><text start="2765.64" dur="4.26">um and I think maybe that&apos;s a core part</text><text start="2767.92" dur="4.08">of my sort of Maximum collective</text><text start="2769.9" dur="4.32">intelligence future is that we we</text><text start="2772.0" dur="3.78">recognize that when we are

dur="2.7">substrate of growth I think about</text><text start="2791.44" dur="3.3">actually our friend Jackie and versus</text><text start="2793.0" dur="3.48">introduced me to this concept of

speeds are culture and</text><text start="2807.7" dur="4.56">nature and when we think about you know</text><text start="2810.04" dur="4.319">at what layer institutions operate I</text><text start="2812.26" dur="3.96">would say at all of them and you need</text><text start="2814.359" dur="3.901">very stable institutions in some sense</text><text start="2816.22" dur="4.26">at some of the cultural layers as well</text><text start="2818.26" dur="5.22">as very fast institutions at some of the</text><text start="2820.48" dur="4.619">higher layers right and so maybe maybe</text><text

start="2869.74" dur="3.56">reassuring in all this chaos to be able</text><text start="2871.42" dur="3.72">to like lean on the word institutions</text><text start="2873.3" dur="4.9">that&apos;s the thing that we&apos;re trying to</text><text start="2875.14" dur="4.32">create like but that feels good yeah the</text><text start="2878.2" dur="3.06">meme you know there&apos;s certain memes that</text><text start="2879.46" dur="3.659">have come out of this conversation that</text><text start="2881.26" dur="4.62">are just sticking in my brain and the</text><text start="2883.119" dur="4.021">combination of fluid institutions I know</text><text start="2885.88" dur="2.64">just kind of like tickled my brain a</text><text start="2887.14" dur="3.78">little bit to think about an institution</text><text start="2888.52" dur="4.86">but it&apos;s not archaic and decaying its</text><text start="2890.92" dur="4.139">fluid and it&apos;s does that mean I guess it</text><text start="2893.38" dur="3.9">just takes higher resolution inputs and</text><text start="2895.059" dur="4.321">can respond to more more data how would</text><text start="2897.28" dur="4.76">you define a fluid institution or is</text><text start="2899.38" dur="5.4">that just a word that you just made up</text><text start="2902.04" dur="4.0">it feels right um responsiveness</text><text start="2904.78" dur="2.88">definitely</text><text start="2906.04" dur="4.079">um some larger sense of like more</text><text start="2907.66" dur="4.5">holistic uh it serves a more holistic</text><text start="2910.119" dur="4.7">role and takes into account preferences</text><text start="2912.16" dur="2.659">more holistically</text><text start="2915.94" dur="4.5">um I&apos;d love to pinch and zoom on Divi</text><text start="2918.46" dur="4.26">you said that you were kind of like when</text><text start="2920.44" dur="3.78">I challenged the word institutions I I</text><text start="2922.72" dur="3.06">think that you reacted with a certain</text><text start="2924.22" dur="3.54">amount of um</text><text start="2925.78" dur="3.839">pushback that like we shouldn&apos;t abandon</text><text start="2927.76" dur="3.9">our old institutions I don&apos;t want to put</text><text start="2929.619" dur="4.021">words in your mouth but</text><text start="2931.66" dur="4.199">um I guess I&apos;m just wondering like is</text><text start="2933.64" dur="4.08">there a a spectrum between like our</text><text start="2935.859" dur="4.801">Industrial Age institutions to fluid</text><text start="2937.72" dur="7.02">institutions to web scale coordination</text><text start="2940.66" dur="4.8">substrates and what is a</text><text start="2944.74" dur="4.26">um</text><text start="2945.46" dur="6.42">what is an effective way of taking</text><text start="2949.0" dur="5.16">advantage of of the novel but without</text><text start="2951.88" dur="4.26">moving too far away from the tried and</text><text start="2954.16" dur="4.26">true you know like how do we oscillate</text><text start="2956.14" dur="4.26">between between those two things I guess</text><text start="2958.42" dur="3.0">I just wanted to pinch and zoom on that</text><text start="2960.4" dur="2.459">because it seemed like there was some</text><text start="2961.42" dur="2.639">daylight between us and how we view</text><text start="2962.859" dur="2.341">these things</text><text start="2964.059" dur="3.421">yeah</text><text start="2965.2" dur="4.74">yeah maybe I I mean one is that I have</text><text start="2967.48" dur="5.28">quite an expand</text><text start="2969.94" dur="4.679">also say you know what about like Bronze</text><text start="2972.76" dur="4.26">Age institutions right things like</text><text start="2974.619" dur="6.0">community and family</text><text start="2977.02" dur="6.18">um are much older and are also types of</text><text start="2980.619" dur="5.161">shared norms and processes and goals and</text><text start="2983.2" dur="4.02">you know institutions like there are</text><text start="2985.78" dur="3.66">some institutions that have been with us</text><text start="2987.22" dur="4.44">for you know a while but not that long</text><text start="2989.44" dur="3.96">like nation states</text><text start="2991.66" dur="4.38">um that I think are quite interesting in</text><text start="2993.4" dur="5.1">that interregnum between things that are</text><text start="2996.04" dur="4.079">feel old but are actually somewhat new</text><text start="2998.5" dur="3.18">and I think that something like nation</text><text start="3000.119" dur="3.601">states may be something that we would</text><text start="3001.68" dur="3.6">agree on or not have daylight over need</text><text start="3003.72" dur="3.66">to be massively changed right because</text><text start="3005.28" dur="4.02">the more the more the world becomes</text><text start="3007.38" dur="3.719">complex the more the substrate of</text><text start="3009.3" dur="3.42">coordination that we need either goes</text><text start="3011.099" dur="4.02">down to the local level or up to the</text><text start="3012.72" dur="5.52">global level and so then we have sort of</text><text start="3015.119" dur="5.041">like a a an archaic intermediary perhaps</text><text start="3018.24" dur="4.859">in the form of the nation state but to</text><text start="3020.16" dur="4.919">me that&apos;s not necessarily just a step</text><text start="3023.099" dur="3.96">forward that&apos;s also a real understanding</text><text start="3025.079" dur="3.721">of our the historical contingency of</text><text start="3027.059" dur="3.601">nation states I mean some of the ways</text><text start="3028.8" dur="3.6">that original Nations state AIDS you</text><text start="3030.66" dur="3.54">know emerged out of corporate forms in</text><text start="3032.4" dur="4.08">some senses and and you know out of</text><text start="3034.2" dur="4.32">Empires and those types of Institutions</text><text start="3036.48" dur="3.96">are actually quite recent in the grand</text><text start="3038.52" dur="6.48">scheme of things and so</text><text start="3040.44" dur="6.419">um to me I would say am I wedded to the</text><text start="3045.0" dur="4.02">institutions of the last 100 years not</text><text start="3046.859" dur="4.921">necessarily but what I am wedded to is</text><text start="3049.02" dur="5.339">one the concept of Institutions like the</text><text start="3051.78" dur="4.5">idea that what we are doing when we are</text><text start="3054.359" dur="4.021">taking these types of actions is</text><text start="3056.28" dur="4.38">partially but not only institution</text><text start="3058.38" dur="4.86">building and that that in fact is a good</text><text start="3060.66" dur="4.919">thing because we want institutions to</text><text start="3063.24" dur="4.44">channel ourselves through as well as we</text><text start="3065.579" dur="4.441">want other things and then two to look</text><text start="3067.68" dur="3.6">into the history of institution I mean I</text><text start="3070.02" dur="2.94">love like David graybear and David</text><text start="3071.28" dur="2.76">wenger&apos;s work for this for example where</text><text start="3072.96" dur="2.82">I think when they describe different</text><text start="3074.04" dur="4.079">types of governance processes they&apos;re</text><text start="3075.78" dur="5.64">also describing types of institutional</text><text start="3078.119" dur="5.761">Arrangements over thousands of years</text><text start="3081.42" dur="4.32">um and therefore using an Institutional</text><text start="3083.88" dur="3.12">lens can be very helpful so if we ground</text><text start="3085.74" dur="2.46">ourselves in the present moment and</text><text start="3087.0" dur="3.18">think about well what do we want out of</text><text start="3088.2" dur="4.8">Technology you know in the next 10 years</text><text start="3090.18" dur="3.899">well I think what we want is an</text><text start="3093.0" dur="2.7">understanding of the things that have</text><text start="3094.079" dur="3.801">worked for a really long time which to</text><text start="3095.7" dur="5.58">me are at least sort of like good</text><text start="3097.88" dur="5.86">laterally balanced in institutional</text><text start="3101.28" dur="4.079">interactions and the types of local</text><text start="3103.74" dur="4.44">control that have been a part of human</text><text start="3105.359" dur="4.26">society forever as well as now we need</text><text start="3108.18" dur="3.54">something new right we need to contend</text><text start="3109.619" dur="4.44">with problems at global scale quickly</text><text start="3111.72" dur="4.379">and urgently and that&apos;s different and we</text><text start="3114.059" dur="3.721">can&apos;t always purely Look Backwards for</text><text start="3116.099" dur="3.361">something like that so then we have a</text><text start="3117.78" dur="3.839">new technology that can do those layers</text><text start="3119.46" dur="4.08">in a way that nothing else could now we</text><text start="3121.619" dur="3.901">can gather those types of preferences as</text><text start="3123.54" dur="3.299">you were talking about uh in a way that</text><text start="3125.52" dur="2.94">we couldn&apos;t before as Raymond mentioned</text><text start="3126.839" dur="2.821">right these fluid institutions that&apos;s</text><text start="3128.46" dur="4.5">something that maybe we couldn&apos;t have</text><text start="3129.66" dur="5.04">done that we can&apos;t troll history for but</text><text start="3132.96" dur="3.3">so much of the inputs to those fluid</text><text start="3134.7" dur="3.72">institutions we can and now we have</text><text start="3136.26" dur="4.74">technologies that can Federate and scale</text><text start="3138.42" dur="5.58">what we have often and always wanted to</text><text start="3141.0" dur="6.2">do uh so the question for you is is</text><text start="3144.0" dur="3.2">ethereum an institution</text><text start="3148.74" dur="3.319">yeah</text><text start="3150.18" dur="5.24">okay yeah it is quite amazing</text><text start="3152.059" dur="6.461">institutional vocabulary it has</text><text start="3155.42" dur="5.139">Tech which is definitely</text><text start="3158.52" dur="4.26">got it not all institutions have have</text><text start="3160.559" dur="4.461">you know maybe that much that much Tech</text><text start="3162.78" dur="4.559">mm-hmm</text><text start="3165.02" dur="4.42">elements I mean I would say like</text><text start="3167.339" dur="5.22">language is an institution for example</text><text start="3169.44" dur="6.659">right I mean institutions don&apos;t have to</text><text start="3172.559" dur="4.8">be things that can be approached in a</text><text start="3176.099" dur="3.121">shared way that contains shared</text><text start="3177.359" dur="4.5">knowledge and processes to me are</text><text start="3179.22" dur="4.859">institutions like a piece of art can</text><text start="3181.859" dur="3.96">become an institution</text><text start="3184.079" dur="3.301">um and those are the types of things</text><text start="3185.819" dur="4.141">that we come together over so like yes</text><text start="3187.38" dur="3.9">ethereum is an institution also many of</text><text start="3189.96" dur="3.659">the things that are built on ethereum</text><text start="3191.28" dur="4.02">are institutions then you might ask</text><text start="3193.619" dur="3.301">yourself one might ask oneself what</text><text start="3195.3" dur="4.5">isn&apos;t an institution I mean am I ever</text><text start="3196.92" dur="5.34">safe right I think that you know there</text><text start="3199.8" dur="5.279">are types of things when we move between</text><text start="3202.26" dur="3.72">types of Institutions like versus there</text><text start="3205.079" dur="2.76">were a bunch of people that came</text><text start="3205.98" dur="4.079">together before we wrote the Declaration</text><text start="3207.839" dur="4.02">and it wasn&apos;t an institution at that</text><text start="3210.059" dur="4.26">point and in fact we were in the process</text><text start="3211.859" dur="5.521">of becoming an institution and it&apos;s not</text><text start="3214.319" dur="4.621">easy I mean it takes work and you have</text><text start="3217.38" dur="3.959">to figure out what you are approaching</text><text start="3218.94" dur="4.56">in a shared way and so I think that you</text><text start="3221.339" dur="4.321">know there are things also I will say</text><text start="3223.5" dur="4.559">that are not institutions and that is</text><text start="3225.66" dur="4.439">you know part of the substrate the</text><text start="3228.059" dur="5.221">Ecology of humanity</text><text start="3230.099" dur="5.101">so the the Oxford dictionary definition</text><text start="3233.28" dur="4.62">of institution is an established law</text><text start="3235.2" dur="4.379">practice or custom so to me established</text><text start="3237.9" dur="4.199">means that it&apos;s highly legitimate it has</text><text start="3239.579" dur="5.161">a high amount of social order so you</text><text start="3242.099" dur="5.281">know we&apos;re having this is that how does</text><text start="3244.74" dur="4.319">that land for you as a definition</text><text start="3247.38" dur="2.88">Margaret Levi actually who may be</text><text start="3249.059" dur="3.481">defined</text><text start="3250.26" dur="4.38">slightly more</text><text start="3252.54" dur="5.22">way and perhaps it&apos;s really just the</text><text start="3254.64" dur="4.679">word established and maybe established</text><text start="3257.76" dur="3.66">means different things to different</text><text start="3259.319" dur="3.361">people but I would replace established</text><text start="3261.42" dur="5.34">with something like</text><text start="3262.68" dur="6.5">you know shared and made legitimate or</text><text start="3266.76" dur="6.24">something like that because</text><text start="3269.18" dur="5.98">established kind of in it implies a</text><text start="3273.0" dur="3.839">point of view established who thinks</text><text start="3275.16" dur="4.26">something is established right and I</text><text start="3276.839" dur="3.841">think I don&apos;t that is actually maybe one</text><text start="3279.42" dur="3.3">of the reasons you push on institutions</text><text start="3280.68" dur="3.179">to start with is that it it assumes a</text><text start="3282.72" dur="3.0">third party point of view and it&apos;s</text><text start="3283.859" dur="3.24">legitimated by an outsider and that&apos;s</text><text start="3285.72" dur="2.72">not what we want we want institutions</text><text start="3287.099" dur="3.421">that are inside</text><text start="3288.44" dur="3.82">legitimated we&apos;re saying we are an</text><text start="3290.52" dur="4.26">institution and it makes it an</text><text start="3292.26" dur="3.66">institution and like that really is the</text><text start="3294.78" dur="3.42">difference between me and the Oxford</text><text start="3295.92" dur="4.139">handbook but you know I think that</text><text start="3298.2" dur="3.84">institutions can be legitimated in that</text><text start="3300.059" dur="4.201">emergent way and that expands a</text><text start="3302.04" dur="3.96">definition usefully right yeah and</text><text start="3304.26" dur="4.26">established kind of implies an</text><text start="3306.0" dur="5.22">entrenchedness entrenchment that I think</text><text start="3308.52" dur="4.02">is maybe a feature in some places like</text><text start="3311.22" dur="3.06">you know with Bitcoin you know it&apos;ll</text><text start="3312.54" dur="3.36">always be there</text><text start="3314.28" dur="4.319">um but the entrenchment means that you</text><text start="3315.9" dur="3.659">can&apos;t get away from it also so</text><text start="3318.599" dur="3.801">um I guess that&apos;s where I have an</text><text start="3319.559" dur="2.841">aversion to that definition</text><text start="3322.559" dur="4.321">um okay last question is there anything</text><text start="3324.839" dur="4.081">that I didn&apos;t ask that you want to talk</text><text start="3326.88" dur="3.6">about and I guess Raymond will uh we&apos;ll</text><text start="3328.92" dur="4.62">start with you</text><text start="3330.48" dur="4.5">I think I think we covered a lot um</text><text start="3333.54" dur="3.66">there are definitely many more things we</text><text start="3334.98" dur="5.22">could talk about that way I know and</text><text start="3337.2" dur="4.859">explore I know to have you back</text><text start="3340.2" dur="3.96">um all right David how about you</text><text start="3342.059" dur="6.181">yeah I mean hopefully we will in our</text><text start="3344.16" dur="7.26">lives talk about many more things uh</text><text start="3348.24" dur="5.52">I guess to me and maybe it&apos;s just a</text><text start="3351.42" dur="5.22">concluding thought like it feels like</text><text start="3353.76" dur="4.559">there is something of an open window of</text><text start="3356.64" dur="4.86">space and Technologies often open up</text><text start="3358.319" dur="5.76">such a window where we can reimagine our</text><text start="3361.5" dur="5.46">shared institutions let&apos;s say and</text><text start="3364.079" dur="4.26">ourselves perhaps and you know it&apos;s rare</text><text start="3366.96" dur="3.359">to have such a window that&apos;s what</text><text start="3368.339" dur="3.72">brought me to this space I sort of like</text><text start="3370.319" dur="4.141">was working on other questions of</text><text start="3372.059" dur="4.8">democracy and politics and cooperatives</text><text start="3374.46" dur="5.46">and kind of came in here because it felt</text><text start="3376.859" dur="5.821">like an open window and I I mean I&apos;m</text><text start="3379.92" dur="6.54">really grateful to you and to so many</text><text start="3382.68" dur="5.1">people in this ecosystem and to forcing</text><text start="3386.46" dur="5.76">that window open like keeping it open</text><text start="3387.78" dur="7.62">and so I guess I&apos;m just I I hope that</text><text start="3392.22" dur="5.16">folks kind of recognize the Rarity and</text><text start="3395.4" dur="3.24">also the urgency of something like an</text><text start="3397.38" dur="3.6">open window where you can actually</text><text start="3398.64" dur="4.919">change the way that institutional</text><text start="3400.98" dur="3.66">arrangements are and the gradient for</text><text start="3403.559" dur="3.841">that change</text><text start="3404.64" dur="4.74">is not always great you know like the</text><text start="3407.4" dur="4.02">the default mode of where that change is</text><text start="3409.38" dur="3.78">going is like reconcentrating power and</text><text start="3411.42" dur="4.56">giving us mostly what we already have</text><text start="3413.16" dur="4.38">that&apos;s always true and yet some open</text><text start="3415.98" dur="4.139">windows allow us to redirect that</text><text start="3417.54" dur="4.079">gradient and it&apos;s a tough job and the</text><text start="3420.119" dur="3.901">most you can do is redirect the gradient</text><text start="3421.619" dur="4.68">like that I do believe like you can&apos;t</text><text start="3424.02" dur="5.16">build the world from scratch you can you</text><text start="3426.299" dur="4.081">can divert the river and like I&apos;m I&apos;m</text><text start="3429.18" dur="2.939">excited that so many people are</text><text start="3430.38" dur="3.54">interested in that River diversion and I</text><text start="3432.119" dur="3.781">guess I&apos;m just grateful to be a part of</text><text start="3433.92" dur="4.26">that space and and hope that people feel</text><text start="3435.9" dur="4.439">that and can work towards it totally so</text><text start="3438.18" dur="4.8">if I&apos;m a green pill listener and I kind</text><text start="3440.339" dur="4.381">of want to uh steer us away from the</text><text start="3442.98" dur="4.68">status quo and steer us away from the</text><text start="3444.72" dur="4.44">failure modes what can I do</text><text start="3447.66" dur="3.72">um what what are the the Practical</text><text start="3449.16" dur="4.26">everyday muscles that I can be building</text><text start="3451.38" dur="3.3">or things that I can focus on it&apos;s</text><text start="3453.42" dur="2.52">probably different for everyone like</text><text start="3454.68" dur="3.36">everybody has a different set of things</text><text start="3455.94" dur="3.419">that they bring at the table</text><text start="3458.04" dur="3.18">um</text><text start="3459.359" dur="3.541">and there are a lot of pieces that need</text><text start="3461.22" dur="3.3">to come together for this to happen</text><text start="3462.9" dur="3.78">right there&apos;s the</text><text start="3464.52" dur="4.98">we&apos;ve been talking about a lot of the um</text><text start="3466.68" dur="5.76">political economy and the ideas behind</text><text start="3469.5" dur="6.66">it but as well as like all the work that</text><text start="3472.44" dur="5.639">it will take to operationalize this um</text><text start="3476.16" dur="4.199">from putting people together to to</text><text start="3478.079" dur="3.72">Building

start="3487.14" dur="4.679">yeah control then it&apos;s and this movie is</text><text start="3489.48" dur="4.139">a is a trivial answer but it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="3491.819" dur="4.26">about how do you control your your</text><text start="3493.619" dur="4.321">locality right like that is why it&apos;s</text><text start="3496.079" dur="3.72">context specific it&apos;s it&apos;s because this</text><text start="3497.94" dur="4.619">is an inherently</text><text start="3499.799" dur="4.8">uh grounded way of looking at things but</text><text start="3502.559" dur="3.721">you know what levers do you have to pull</text><text start="3504.599" dur="2.821">are you a technologist well can you work</text><text start="3506.28" dur="2.46">on building these types of
