dur="5.16">thought</text><text start="445.88" dur="6.219">and um ended up being 1500 people from</text><text start="450.12" dur="4.979">something like 40 countries I mean it</text><text start="452.099" dur="4.921">was crazy uh Market timing was good I</text><text start="455.099" dur="4.201">think the geolocation for Denver&apos;s good</text><text start="457.02" dur="4.619">you know you can go here this is</text><text start="459.3" dur="4.799">February 2018. is that right 15 was the</text><text start="461.639" dur="5.701">first installation yeah so</text><text start="464.099" dur="5.16">we grew pretty steadily by about 500</text><text start="467.34" dur="3.84">people a year for the first two two</text><text start="469.259" dur="5.16">installations after that so 2019 and</text><text start="471.18" dur="6.48">2020 were 2 000 and 2500 people each</text><text start="474.419" dur="7.081">and then virtual happened and then we</text><text start="477.66" dur="5.64">had like 31 000 virtual participants in</text><text start="481.5" dur="3.539">various capacities</text><text start="483.3" dur="3.36">but it&apos;s it&apos;s sort of hard to quantify</text><text start="485.039" dur="3.541">that because like it&apos;s not really a good</text><text start="486.66" dur="3.539">way to measure all that but there&apos;s a</text><text start="488.58" dur="4.98">ton of traffic and a ton of people</text><text start="490.199" dur="5.581">around we had a augmented reality space</text><text start="493.56" dur="3.96">and an nft scavenger hunt and all this</text><text start="495.78" dur="5.4">stuff that we were doing online</text><text start="497.52" dur="5.94">and it was very well received and then</text><text start="501.18" dur="3.78">boy you know we were completely and</text><text start="503.46" dur="4.2">totally unprepared for what happened</text><text start="504.96" dur="6.0">this year which was 28 000 applications</text><text start="507.66" dur="5.04">13 000 attendees over a hundred</text><text start="510.96" dur="4.439">countries two million dollars in</text><text start="512.7" dur="6.719">bounties and prizes given out</text><text start="515.399" dur="6.781">and it was crazy I mean it was uh</text><text start="519.419" dur="4.62">fantastic in a lot of ways but you know</text><text start="522.18" dur="4.62">for those of that were here and saw the</text><text start="524.039" dur="4.92">long lines and the bad bathrooms and you</text><text start="526.8" dur="3.599">know some of that it&apos;s pretty clear that</text><text start="528.959" dur="3.361">we outgrew</text><text start="530.399" dur="3.901">kind of what you know where we&apos;ve come</text><text start="532.32" dur="4.32">from so</text><text start="534.3" dur="4.92">um yeah the thesis behind it is really</text><text start="536.64" dur="5.52">three pillars it&apos;s Community</text><text start="539.22" dur="5.4">um biddling and education so we don&apos;t</text><text start="542.16" dur="4.98">have a barrier to entry we prefer to</text><text start="544.62" dur="4.74">give people as much free education as</text><text start="547.14" dur="5.1">possible and remove barriers not looking</text><text start="549.36" dur="4.44">for extractive points and you know money</text><text start="552.24" dur="4.08">making opportunities I mean those</text><text start="553.8" dur="4.2">present themselves in in regen games a</text><text start="556.32" dur="4.62">little differently than they do in Degen</text><text start="558.0" dur="4.459">or extractive games so we we don&apos;t</text><text start="560.94" dur="4.5">charge for entry</text><text start="562.459" dur="5.081">and you know probably 40 of the people</text><text start="565.44" dur="3.66">that show up if you&apos;re noobs they don&apos;t</text><text start="567.54" dur="3.96">you know they&apos;re crypto curious they</text><text start="569.1" dur="4.08">don&apos;t know much about crypto but they&apos;ve</text><text start="571.5" dur="5.64">kind of heard a little bit about it or</text><text start="573.18" dur="6.18">smart contracts or green pilling or D5</text><text start="577.14" dur="5.699">or whatever it is you know they&apos;re</text><text start="579.36" dur="5.64">coming to explore and we like that</text><text start="582.839" dur="4.56">um you know compared to like</text><text start="585.0" dur="4.56">most of the other ticketed events around</text><text start="587.399" dur="4.741">the community even Devcon it&apos;s you know</text><text start="589.56" dur="4.32">pretty steep price you know you gotta</text><text start="592.14" dur="3.12">put up a bunch of money and most people</text><text start="593.88" dur="3.18">that don&apos;t know about the ecosystem</text><text start="595.26" dur="4.56">aren&apos;t going to do that so like we&apos;re</text><text start="597.06" dur="5.279">trying to keep the on-ramp open and</text><text start="599.82" dur="4.199">and wide so people can come and explore</text><text start="602.339" dur="4.021">and learn and</text><text start="604.019" dur="4.641">engage build</text><text start="606.36" dur="4.68">and ultimately be a part of a community</text><text start="608.66" dur="5.679">so it&apos;s it&apos;s been it&apos;s been an</text><text start="611.04" dur="5.06">interesting ride now 2023 for

experiment I was I was very</text><text start="754.26" dur="4.8">happy to be a part of that yeah totally</text><text start="757.38" dur="3.78">um and you know I I think that that&apos;s</text><text

start="771.42" dur="4.56">get coin Kudos which was our nft</text><text start="773.519" dur="4.5">experiment at the time to 10 I think it</text><text start="775.98" dur="3.479">was thousands of people

dur="4.86">hmm nice so I mean I guess like the you</text><text start="831.779" dur="2.161">know those are the experiments that I&apos;m</text><text start="832.86" dur="2.279">aware of but one of the things I&apos;ve</text><text start="833.94" dur="3.78">always liked about East Denver is it&apos;s</text><text start="835.139" dur="4.2">tried to work in crypto stuff into its</text><text start="837.72" dur="3.299">Community Austin Griffith is out here in</text><text start="839.339" dur="3.901">the burner wallet I think it was Genesis</text><text start="841.019" dur="4.32">in Colorado and I just think that that</text><text start="843.24" dur="3.839">is a major point of legitimacy for me</text><text start="845.339" dur="3.721">for East Denver</text><text start="847.079" dur="3.841">yeah one of the things that we&apos;ve always</text><text start="849.06" dur="4.079">sort of been</text><text start="850.92" dur="5.64">it&apos;s been a little curious to me is like</text><text start="853.139" dur="6.601">why we don&apos;t see more Tech at these web</text><text start="856.56" dur="4.98">three conferences and it&apos;s like isn&apos;t</text><text start="859.74" dur="5.279">that the whole point</text><text start="861.54" dur="5.22">uh so we took a very much an</text><text start="865.019" dur="3.901">experiential approach so we&apos;re less</text><text start="866.76" dur="3.54">confidence more experience which is why</text><text start="868.92" dur="4.859">we call it a community Innovation</text><text start="870.3" dur="5.18">Festival where when you come it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="873.779" dur="5.101">have the traditional expo hall</text><text start="875.48" dur="4.599">conferencing top-down sort of like you</text><text start="878.88" dur="2.28">know</text><text start="880.079" dur="4.32">you know</text><text start="881.16" dur="5.039">VC vests and stuff going on like or the</text><text start="884.399" dur="3.661">you know Wall Street suits you know</text><text start="886.199" dur="4.38">we&apos;ve got</text><text start="888.06" dur="5.16">all varieties of people doing really</text><text start="890.579" dur="5.94">incredible creative things artists</text><text start="893.22" dur="5.88">makers hackers Builders Nomads you name</text><text start="896.519" dur="4.921">it people are coming and doing stuff</text><text start="899.1" dur="4.56">but as far as the event goes we try to</text><text start="901.44" dur="4.44">give people a glimpse into the future</text><text start="903.66" dur="4.32">and so having the crypto enabled food</text><text start="905.88" dur="4.44">trucks and being able to pay with a</text><text start="907.98" dur="5.94">native Community currency or you know</text><text start="910.32" dur="5.16">doing a scavenger hunt for nfts and and</text><text start="913.92" dur="3.599">sort of proving your attendance and</text><text start="915.48" dur="4.32">earning deeper engagement into the</text><text start="917.519" dur="4.32">community or it&apos;s you know quadratic</text><text start="919.8" dur="3.839">voting in terms of the community voting</text><text start="921.839" dur="4.021">and signal on the projects that are</text><text start="923.639" dur="4.32">submitted to the hackathon or or</text><text start="925.86" dur="4.979">whatever right I mean there&apos;s a whole</text><text start="927.959" dur="5.101">bunch of stuff that we we&apos;ve done and</text><text start="930.839" dur="4.56">that we&apos;re going to continue to do and</text><text start="933.06" dur="5.04">and look for new opportunities</text><text start="935.399" dur="4.8">to give really that again Glimpse to the</text><text start="938.1" dur="4.2">Future because you know we can sit</text><text start="940.199" dur="4.14">around and talk about stuff all day but</text><text start="942.3" dur="4.14">talking about something</text><text start="944.339" dur="3.12">and experiencing something are two</text><text start="946.44" dur="3.0">different things</text><text start="947.459" dur="4.081">right</text><text start="949.44" dur="4.019">yeah I mean I think it&apos;s it&apos;s really</text><text start="951.54" dur="5.22">kind of neat how the frontier has been</text><text start="953.459" dur="5.761">pushed out here in in the um in the web</text><text start="956.76" dur="3.84">3 space and and I think that&apos;s one neat</text><text start="959.22" dur="4.58">thing but also just the breadth of what</text><text start="960.6" dur="7.08">you&apos;re up to uh I&apos;d love to talk about</text><text start="963.8" dur="6.039">sporked out and Innovation jam and all</text><text start="967.68" dur="4.62">the things that have kind of spun out of</text><text start="969.839" dur="4.62">East Denver or you the different</text><text start="972.3" dur="4.32">different different points of the spork</text><text start="974.459" dur="4.68">so so can you pull that thread and tell</text><text start="976.62" dur="4.86">us about those yeah so one of the things</text><text start="979.139" dur="5.161">that I mean we we created a Dao out of</text><text start="981.48" dur="7.44">E10 versus like I said this back</text><text start="984.3" dur="6.06">on Main stage probably 2019 I think is</text><text start="988.92" dur="3.24">when I said it we&apos;re going to turn eight</text><text start="990.36" dur="3.539">Denver into a dow and everyone&apos;s like</text><text start="992.16" dur="3.78">what how are you gonna do that now the</text><text start="993.899" dur="5.221">downers are like yeah man that&apos;s gonna</text><text start="995.94" dur="5.04">be awesome like but nobody had any idea</text><text start="999.12" dur="4.38">exactly how we would do that I mean</text><text start="1000.98" dur="4.919">we&apos;re a geo-located event you can&apos;t just</text><text start="1003.5" dur="3.779">YOLO an event with liability concerns</text><text start="1005.899" dur="3.06">and</text><text start="1007.279" dur="4.141">you know there&apos;s a lot of things that</text><text start="1008.959" dur="4.981">could go wrong with you know just</text><text start="1011.42" dur="4.8">jumping in the pool into dawifying an</text><text start="1013.94" dur="4.519">event Community event and then figuring</text><text start="1016.22" dur="5.76">out how to tokenize it not you know</text><text start="1018.459" dur="6.1">violate any big laws or rules or</text><text start="1021.98" dur="6.719">anything like how do you do this so it</text><text start="1024.559" dur="6.421">took us a while but in May 2021 we moved</text><text start="1028.699" dur="3.24">everything to sportdow so sportdow is</text><text start="1030.98" dur="3.24">the</text><text start="1031.939" dur="5.701">the master Dao and then the meta Dows</text><text start="1034.22" dur="6.0">are eat Denver Colorado Jam</text><text start="1037.64" dur="5.34">and buffacorn Ventures</text><text start="1040.22" dur="5.16">so it&apos;s kind of the and then the the</text><text start="1042.98" dur="4.56">fourth sprawl the the fourth prong is</text><text start="1045.38" dur="4.08">the community right so there&apos;s these</text><text start="1047.54" dur="4.62">three sort of orgs inside the community</text><text start="1049.46" dur="4.44">and then the community itself is the</text><text start="1052.16" dur="3.84">fourth prong in terms of the value</text><text start="1053.9" dur="5.279">points for sporked out</text><text start="1056.0" dur="5.64">so the spork meme came from</text><text start="1059.179" dur="4.86">um we were messing around with like when</text><text start="1061.64" dur="5.52">they were talking about hard forks and</text><text start="1064.039" dur="4.801">soft Forks back in 2017 2018 and how</text><text start="1067.16" dur="3.66">people were making comparisons to the</text><text start="1068.84" dur="3.48">Bitcoin community and how they were hard</text><text start="1070.82" dur="4.68">forking all the time and it was not</text><text start="1072.32" dur="5.64">collaborative but all the the forks in</text><text start="1075.5" dur="4.02">ethereum were always very uh</text><text start="1077.96" dur="4.68">non-contentious right they&apos;re very</text><text start="1079.52" dur="5.1">friendly and so there was somebody I</text><text start="1082.64" dur="3.36">originally said you know it&apos;s like a</text><text start="1084.62" dur="3.059">soft fork and then I said I don&apos;t know</text><text start="1086.0" dur="4.559">kind of like a spork and they&apos;re like</text><text start="1087.679" dur="3.901">yeah so then we started we brought uh we</text><text start="1090.559" dur="3.601">actually bought a whole bunch of</text><text start="1091.58" dur="4.38">biodegradable sporks in 2019 and how to</text><text start="1094.16" dur="4.019">model all the food trucks so like the</text><text start="1095.96" dur="4.86">utensils they gave you instead of a fork</text><text start="1098.179" dur="4.62">was a spork so we started doing that and</text><text start="1100.82" dur="3.12">then like people really liked the meme</text><text start="1102.799" dur="3.601">and</text><text start="1103.94" dur="5.82">and then we just turned it into kind of</text><text start="1106.4" dur="5.279">the you know it&apos;s the preferred tool of</text><text start="1109.76" dur="3.36">choice for biddlers at East Denver is</text><text start="1111.679" dur="2.88">the sport I mean you could battle with</text><text start="1113.12" dur="3.179">it you could dig with it you could</text><text start="1114.559" dur="3.141">fiddle with it you can do all sorts of</text><text start="1116.299" dur="4.861">stuff so it&apos;s kind of it&apos;s this</text><text start="1117.7" dur="6.099">representation of this massively you</text><text start="1121.16" dur="4.8">know versatile tool and we just kind of</text><text start="1123.799" dur="4.62">ran with it so now it&apos;s like a thing so</text><text start="1125.96" dur="5.16">the community token is Spork and</text><text start="1128.419" dur="5.041">sporked out is the name and you know the</text><text start="1131.12" dur="6.059">game is about biddling which is sort of</text><text start="1133.46" dur="6.18">representative of the spork in itself so</text><text start="1137.179" dur="5.761">um the different activities in terms of</text><text start="1139.64" dur="5.34">creating uh regen games so like</text><text start="1142.94" dur="3.72">uh if they&apos;ve ever run an event and</text><text start="1144.98" dur="4.02">Kevin you have</text><text start="1146.66" dur="3.48">um they&apos;re expensive</text><text start="1149.0" dur="4.14">yeah</text><text start="1150.14" dur="5.58">like brutally expensive and you know</text><text start="1153.14" dur="4.86">when you&apos;re trying to keep things free</text><text start="1155.72" dur="6.18">you know the temptation to charge for</text><text start="1158.0" dur="5.22">tickets is really big because</text><text start="1161.9" dur="2.82">you know how else are you going to</text><text start="1163.22" dur="3.24">create sustainability it&apos;s not even</text><text start="1164.72" dur="4.199">necessarily about making profits it&apos;s</text><text start="1166.46" dur="4.62">just like how do you keep the lights on</text><text start="1168.919" dur="3.541">so we&apos;ve been very fortunate um that</text><text start="1171.08" dur="2.76">we&apos;ve had enough sponsorship support</text><text start="1172.46" dur="2.88">from the community but then we thought</text><text start="1173.84" dur="3.78">like okay well how do we take this to</text><text start="1175.34" dur="4.14">the next level</text><text start="1177.62" dur="4.02">all these really cool projects come out</text><text start="1179.48" dur="4.38">of you Denver like poapp like pool</text><text start="1181.64" dur="4.5">together like one inch was on our stage</text><text start="1183.86" dur="4.98">in 2019.</text><text start="1186.14" dur="4.56">um winning a finalist prize like what if</text><text start="1188.84" dur="3.78">we had put a small investment as a</text><text start="1190.7" dur="3.06">community into these projects when they</text><text start="1192.62" dur="3.059">were small</text><text start="1193.76" dur="4.68">what would that have meant in terms of</text><text start="1195.679" dur="5.281">you know reciprocating value back so we</text><text start="1198.44" dur="4.14">create the stage in a place for them to</text><text start="1200.96" dur="4.68">kind of launch but then</text><text start="1202.58" dur="4.2">you know how do they give back well you</text><text start="1205.64" dur="2.94">know you&apos;re not going to go to one of</text><text start="1206.78" dur="4.139">these projects and say hey we helped you</text><text start="1208.58" dur="4.86">guys like back then do we get any Equity</text><text start="1210.919" dur="5.281">because they&apos;re gonna go like no</text><text start="1213.44" dur="5.16">but like how do we actually give them</text><text start="1216.2" dur="4.26">value in in a more sustainable way where</text><text start="1218.6" dur="3.24">then the reciprocation comes back so</text><text start="1220.46" dur="3.06">again about creating positive some</text><text start="1221.84" dur="5.16">regenerative games</text><text start="1223.52" dur="5.94">so we uh created buff corn Ventures to</text><text start="1227.0" dur="4.32">do just that so the community funds it</text><text

dur="3.719">know one how do we democratize</text><text start="1501.5" dur="3.659">employment how do we actually give the</text><text start="1503.419" dur="4.26">keys to employment</text><text start="1505.159" dur="3.781">to the individual you and I years and</text><text start="1507.679" dur="2.941">years and years ago we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="1508.94" dur="4.2">the

start="1514.94" dur="4.68">separate</text><text start="1516.799" dur="4.62">and so you know I started working on</text><text start="1519.62" dur="5.22">this</text><text start="1521.419" dur="5.941">um in 2016 I mean I first said the words</text><text start="1524.84" dur="5.64">democratized employment in 2005 so I&apos;ve</text><text start="1527.36" dur="4.98">been at this for 17 years but like and</text><text start="1530.48" dur="3.84">all of it was a culmination to really</text><text start="1532.34" dur="4.56">find this product Market fit which is</text><text start="1534.32" dur="5.459">really a public utility infrastructure</text><text start="1536.9" dur="5.879">and platform for employment that serves</text><text start="1539.779" dur="6.841">independent workers it&apos;s not about you</text><text start="1542.779" dur="7.38">know get coin or you know coinbase being</text><text start="1546.62" dur="6.78">the customer that are in crypto even a</text><text start="1550.159" dur="6.0">doubt like even a maker Dow like maker</text><text start="1553.4" dur="6.0">Dow is a coalition member of the of the</text><text start="1556.159" dur="5.341">employment

game</text><text start="1570.74" dur="5.52">so what we do is</text><text start="1573.679" dur="5.661">we&apos;re a giant bridge for people working</text><text start="1576.26" dur="5.399">ethereally to to gain legitimacy</text><text start="1579.34" dur="5.079">to get things like</text><text start="1581.659" dur="6.841">health care and compliance and payroll</text><text start="1584.419" dur="5.581">taxes being paid and W-2s and pay stubs</text><text start="1588.5" dur="3.72">to actually look like a normal person</text><text start="1590.0" dur="3.48">you can actually plug into opolis and</text><text start="1592.22" dur="3.66">get access to all of those things</text><text start="1593.48" dur="4.799">without giving up your Independence</text><text start="1595.88" dur="4.86">and then for those looking to get into</text><text start="1598.279" dur="3.78">web3 It&apos;s the Great Bridge you know it&apos;s</text><text start="1600.74" dur="3.78">it&apos;s</text><text start="1602.059" dur="4.261">wait I&apos;m supposed to quit my job join a</text><text start="1604.52" dur="3.659">dow not have health care not have a</text><text start="1606.32" dur="3.3">retirement plan and get paid in crypto</text><text start="1608.179" dur="3.961">like how the hell am I supposed to pay</text><text start="1609.62" dur="5.34">for my rent like what do I even do so</text><text start="1612.14" dur="5.58">opolis is the tool and the community and</text><text start="1614.96" dur="5.339">the platform that basically does all</text><text start="1617.72" dur="4.92">that stuff for you so your experience of</text><text start="1620.299" dur="4.62">work is pretty much just like it is</text><text start="1622.64" dur="4.74">right now where you get a paycheck every</text><text start="1624.919" dur="3.661">two weeks and you get a W-2 at the end</text><text start="1627.38" dur="3.0">of the year and you got your group</text><text start="1628.58" dur="3.42">health care plan that&apos;s like really high</text><text start="1630.38" dur="4.2">quality and</text><text start="1632.0" dur="4.32">all of it works really well right so</text><text start="1634.58" dur="4.26">yeah</text><text start="1636.32" dur="5.219">but I would just interject that uh we</text><text start="1638.84" dur="4.74">have object level experience within the</text><text start="1641.539" dur="3.661">get coin dial community of this and that</text><text start="1643.58" dur="4.199">a lot of people are working for tokens</text><text start="1645.2" dur="6.479">in or around get coin Dao and they need</text><text start="1647.779" dur="6.241">a way to show their employment to a bank</text><text start="1651.679" dur="4.141">to I mean whoever would want to look at</text><text start="1654.02" dur="5.159">a pay stub and so you guys are kind of</text><text start="1655.82" dur="4.979">that bridge legitimacy around this right</text><text start="1659.179" dur="3.841">yeah</text><text start="1660.799" dur="4.141">um and so the bridge between the future</text><text start="1663.02" dur="3.539">world in which we&apos;re all working for</text><text start="1664.94" dur="4.38">Global decentralized ledgers</text><text start="1666.559" dur="4.5">decentralized organizations but the rest</text><text start="1669.32" dur="3.3">of the world hasn&apos;t caught up for that</text><text start="1671.059" dur="4.021">opolis seems like it&apos;s public</text><text start="1672.62" dur="4.559">infrastructure for that but I think</text><text start="1675.08" dur="3.9">what&apos;s really cool is that you&apos;re kind</text><text start="1677.179" dur="5.041">of Designing opolis around this work</text><text start="1678.98" dur="5.1">token thing and daoizing it yourself so</text><text start="1682.22" dur="4.559">there&apos;s like that second level of really</text><text start="1684.08" dur="4.56">eating your own dog food uh and I think</text><text start="1686.779" dur="5.101">that&apos;s neat also we don&apos;t think that</text><text start="1688.64" dur="5.519">having a centralized organization</text><text start="1691.88" dur="4.2">um even if you know there&apos;s some other</text><text start="1694.159" dur="3.721">players in the in the the space who are</text><text start="1696.08" dur="3.479">playing well we&apos;re not a doubt yet it&apos;s</text><text start="1697.88" dur="3.899">like okay good luck getting there like</text><text start="1699.559" dur="4.261">if you don&apos;t start it&apos;s like</text><text start="1701.779" dur="3.661">if you don&apos;t actually start with how do</text><text start="1703.82" dur="3.42">you actually build the framework to be</text><text start="1705.44" dur="5.219">able to maintain this benevolence and</text><text start="1707.24" dur="4.86">like give Community ownership of it</text><text start="1710.659" dur="3.661">then you&apos;re just building the old game</text><text start="1712.1" dur="5.04">it&apos;s an US versus them or a service</text><text start="1714.32" dur="4.859">provider in the consumer this is built</text><text start="1717.14" dur="3.84">by Independence for Independence and the</text><text start="1719.179" dur="3.541">work token is the unit of account of</text><text start="1720.98" dur="5.939">ownership in the community the patronage</text><text start="1722.72" dur="7.5">token we have a legal uh rapper of a</text><text start="1726.919" dur="5.101">Cooperative it&apos;s an LCA</text><text start="1730.22" dur="4.68">that</text><text start="1732.02" dur="4.92">gives when you become a member</text><text start="1734.9" dur="4.139">you become an owner it&apos;s like REI for</text><text start="1736.94" dur="4.56">employment</text><text start="1739.039" dur="4.441">so when there&apos;s profits the work token</text><text start="1741.5" dur="3.36">let&apos;s say I own one percent of the work</text><text start="1743.48" dur="3.72">tokens</text><text start="1744.86" dur="4.559">and we got a 10 million dollar</text><text start="1747.2" dur="3.66">dividend you know futuristically because</text><text start="1749.419" dur="2.76">we&apos;re not there yet but let&apos;s say we got</text><text start="1750.86" dur="2.46">a 10 million dollar distribution that</text><text start="1752.179" dur="3.421">we&apos;re going to put out for patronage</text><text start="1753.32" dur="4.08">profits to the community I get one</text><text start="1755.6" dur="3.66">percent of those profits as a member as</text><text start="1757.4" dur="3.659">a consumer</text><text start="1759.26" dur="3.12">right so I&apos;ve earned these tokens</text><text start="1761.059" dur="3.6">through my consumption through my</text><text start="1762.38" dur="4.32">referrals through staking and so we&apos;re</text><text start="1764.659" dur="4.38">we&apos;re rewarding people for activities</text><text start="1766.7" dur="4.44">that are valuable to the community as</text><text start="1769.039" dur="3.961">patronage and then we&apos;re giving them the</text><text start="1771.14" dur="3.96">tokens so when the time comes that&apos;s</text><text start="1773.0" dur="4.08">their right to those distributions and</text><text start="1775.1" dur="4.799">they don&apos;t have to cash in their tokens</text><text start="1777.08" dur="4.68">to get it it&apos;s a perpetuity thing it&apos;s</text><text start="1779.899" dur="4.26">it&apos;s their</text><text start="1781.76" dur="4.74">um ability now and this goes on and on</text><text start="1784.159" dur="3.841">and on and on and so we have an</text><text start="1786.5" dur="4.559">inflation model</text><text start="1788.0" dur="5.159">that&apos;s about a nine to one ratio so like</text><text start="1791.059" dur="5.161">for every 10 percent in value accrual</text><text start="1793.159" dur="6.721">which we measure by payroll growth</text><text start="1796.22" dur="6.8">or if we grow by 10 we inflate the token</text><text start="1799.88" dur="6.06">Supply by about 1.2 percent</text><text start="1803.02" dur="5.08">so there&apos;s a nine to one accrual ratio</text><text start="1805.94" dur="4.619">there in terms of value to to inflation</text><text start="1808.1" dur="4.86">which actually creates continued</text><text start="1810.559" dur="5.881">scarcity and also drives the value of</text><text start="1812.96" dur="5.28">the the token potentially up so</text><text start="1816.44" dur="3.119">um not we&apos;re not involved in secondary</text><text start="1818.24" dur="2.7">markets right now if you go ahead and</text><text start="1819.559" dur="3.36">look at the work token it&apos;s like two</text><text start="1820.94" dur="3.359">cents we don&apos;t care and people are like</text><text start="1822.919" dur="3.541">well how do you get how do you get more</text><text start="1824.299" dur="3.061">demand for the token it&apos;s like I don&apos;t</text><text

dur="3.96">you know so when we first launched our</text><text start="2160.48" dur="5.34">research project on legal Frameworks</text><text start="2162.46" dur="4.98">that could sustain something like this</text><text start="2165.82" dur="3.539">we didn&apos;t even really know what we were</text><text start="2167.44" dur="4.26">looking for yet entirely we just knew</text><text start="2169.359" dur="3.961">that we had to Define it and we had to</text><text start="2171.7" dur="3.3">then kind of compare against different</text><text start="2173.32" dur="3.66">legal Frameworks so then we stumbled on</text><text start="2175.0" dur="3.48">co-ops</text><text start="2176.98" dur="3.72">and one of the things that really stood</text><text start="2178.48" dur="4.08">out to me was cooperative

dur="3.36">well</text><text start="2193.0" dur="4.02">a lot of Cooperative Frameworks</text><text start="2194.74" dur="4.5">nationally don&apos;t have an investor class</text><text start="2197.02" dur="5.04">then you find out that there&apos;s no</text><text start="2199.24" dur="4.56">industry limitations so lots of Co-op</text><text start="2202.06" dur="5.279">Frameworks in different states are</text><text start="2203.8" dur="6.779">limited to like agriculture or you know</text><text start="2207.339" dur="4.74">you know public like uh electricity or</text><text start="2210.579" dur="2.941">something like that like they have very</text><text start="2212.079" dur="4.081">limited scope on what you can use</text><text start="2213.52" dur="5.7">Colorado has no limits</text><text

designing</text><text start="2253.48" dur="5.16">like you know like how would this look</text><text start="2256.359" dur="4.561">and so we basically came up with a</text><text start="2258.64" dur="4.38">framework that you know like I said</text><text start="2260.92" dur="4.8">we&apos;re an employment Dow with the legal</text><text start="2263.02" dur="4.62">rapper of an LCA limited Cooperative</text><text start="2265.72" dur="3.54">Association</text><text start="2267.64" dur="3.24">um we invented the concept of the</text><text start="2269.26" dur="4.579">patronage token which is really just</text><text start="2270.88" dur="6.78">digitizing the already existing</text><text start="2273.839" dur="5.801">patronage mechanism which is the you</text><text start="2277.66"

start="2283.119" dur="3.72">and then we had to Define some</text><text start="2284.74" dur="4.14">governance and some definitions around a</text><text start="2286.839" dur="3.121">bunch of things but then we we settled</text><text start="2288.88" dur="5.459">on a framework that we thought was</text><text start="2289.96" dur="4.98">really cool so now what&apos;s happened is</text><text start="2294.339" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="2294.94" dur="5.639">a whole bunch more people are using this</text><text start="2297.339" dur="4.381">framework as a means to legitimize</text><text start="2300.579" dur="3.0">doubts</text><text start="2301.72" dur="3.899">so there was a lot of talk about the</text><text start="2303.579" dur="4.5">Wyoming Dow framework but it&apos;s really</text><text start="2305.619" dur="3.96">sort of just the Next Generation LLC in</text><text start="2308.079" dur="2.701">some ways it&apos;s very good for an</text><text start="2309.579" dur="3.901">investment Club</text><text start="2310.78" dur="6.12">so if you want to like</text><text start="2313.48" dur="5.52">set up it like an investment vehicle for</text><text start="2316.9" dur="4.679">that that sort of operates like a dow I</text><text start="2319.0" dur="4.44">think it works well for that but it&apos;s</text><text start="2321.579" dur="3.78">not</text><text start="2323.44" dur="3.24">um very good for like a community-based</text><text start="2325.359" dur="2.701">out where you have like some other</text><text start="2326.68" dur="3.899">purpose</text><text start="2328.06" dur="4.559">Again The Cooperative framework seems to</text><text start="2330.579" dur="4.381">fit that really well so</text><text start="2332.619"
