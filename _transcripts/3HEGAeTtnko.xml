dur="4.72">for us um it&apos;s it&apos;s a nice team involved</text><text start="231.84" dur="4.16">with some folks coming from the cleros</text><text start="233.599" dur="4.401">team which is an

dur="3.28">it&apos;s been</text><text start="246.72" dur="4.0">you know quite uh quite a thrill to</text><text start="248.799" dur="4.401">launch something like this and</text><text start="250.72" dur="4.159">so far the the registry keeps growing</text><text start="253.2" dur="3.2">you know more people keep joining from</text><text start="254.879" dur="3.441">all over the world and especially a lot</text><text start="256.4" dur="4.16">of people also from latin america</text><text start="258.32" dur="4.879">especially because many of us founders</text><text start="260.56" dur="4.32">come from from from there</text><text start="263.199" dur="3.521">got it so it seems like</text><text start="264.88" dur="3.2">uh for me being familiar with your your</text><text start="266.72" dur="2.88">work i originally knew you through</text><text start="268.08" dur="2.88">democracy earth where you were</text><text start="269.6" dur="3.28">researching democracy for the</text><text start="270.96" dur="3.6">information age and i guess it would it</text><text start="272.88" dur="3.92">be fair to say that you discovered the</text><text start="274.56" dur="3.68">opportunity for proof of humanity</text><text start="276.8" dur="3.28">through that work</text><text start="278.24" dur="4.72">yeah pretty much like</text><text start="280.08" dur="4.64">when we started democracy earth was</text><text start="282.96" dur="4.32">after the experience of doing a</text><text start="284.72" dur="4.88">political party in argentina departido</text><text start="287.28" dur="5.04">de la red or the net party</text><text start="289.6" dur="4.319">and we started building technology</text><text start="292.32" dur="3.599">trying to figure out what it takes to</text><text start="293.919" dur="4.241">build a democracy over the internet what</text><text start="295.919" dur="3.361">are the big hurdles and we kept doing</text><text start="298.16" dur="3.68">pilots</text><text start="299.28" dur="5.44">of democracy all over the world we we</text><text start="301.84" dur="6.24">have that pilot in hong kong in tunisia</text><text start="304.72" dur="4.56">in spain in mexico you name it</text><text start="308.08" dur="3.679">and</text><text start="309.28" dur="6.08">quite clearly one of the</text><text start="311.759" dur="6.401">you know killer aspects of this or choke</text><text start="315.36" dur="4.96">points uh aspects of these pilots was</text><text start="318.16" dur="3.92">whoever runs the registry of voters</text><text start="320.32" dur="4.159">whoever gets to decide who gets the</text><text start="322.08" dur="6.24">rights to vote pretty much can tumble</text><text start="324.479" dur="5.921">the election uh so pretty pretty</text><text start="328.32" dur="5.36">quickly we realized in some of the</text><text start="330.4" dur="5.92">pilots we got you know civil attacked by</text><text start="333.68" dur="4.4">uh you know a single ip coming from</text><text start="336.32" dur="4.8">china in hong kong sending like</text><text start="338.08" dur="6.48">apparently hundreds of thousands of fake</text><text start="341.12" dur="6.079">users hijacking or shadow referendum to</text><text start="344.56" dur="4.32">elect a a major for hong kong which was</text><text start="347.199" dur="2.881">done in telegram</text><text start="348.88" dur="3.599">or</text><text start="350.08" dur="3.119">in argentina we&apos;ve done a pilot and also</text><text start="352.479" dur="3.201">like</text><text start="353.199" dur="5.361">the workers party suddenly injected a</text><text start="355.68" dur="5.6">lot of fake accounts into the system</text><text start="358.56" dur="5.04">so the problem of identity</text><text start="361.28" dur="4.32">clearly became very relevant</text><text start="363.6" dur="4.08">and like edwards know that once said you</text><text start="365.6" dur="4.879">know identity is the one vulnerability</text><text start="367.68" dur="4.079">being exploited across all systems</text><text start="370.479" dur="2.961">so</text><text start="371.759" dur="3.361">it was really interesting to converge</text><text start="373.44" dur="4.319">into this conversation around proof of</text><text start="375.12" dur="4.639">humanity uh a lot of folks are were</text><text start="377.759" dur="4.16">interested into researching that</text><text start="379.759" dur="3.28">particular problem including vitalik</text><text start="381.919" dur="3.041">himself</text><text start="383.039" dur="4.16">and that led to the creation of the</text><text start="384.96" dur="4.16">proof of humanity protocol</text><text start="387.199" dur="4.081">which we launched in march last year and</text><text start="389.12" dur="3.04">it&apos;s you know a very simple way to try</text><text start="391.28" dur="3.28">to</text><text start="392.16" dur="4.879">figure out how to create human identity</text><text start="394.56" dur="4.72">without relying on a big brother or a</text><text start="397.039" dur="4.801">centralized authority that could</text><text start="399.28" dur="4.32">really influence or or or</text><text start="401.84" dur="3.28">change the registry</text><text start="403.6" dur="3.2">so</text><text start="405.12" dur="4.079">it&apos;s interesting because now since we</text><text start="406.8" dur="4.64">launched we have been able to actually</text><text start="409.199" dur="5.761">run a democratic now the proof of</text><text start="411.44" dur="5.759">humanity now is one person one vote</text><text start="414.96" dur="4.799">it uses liquid democracy so you can</text><text start="417.199" dur="4.961">delegate your vote to someone else and</text><text start="419.759" dur="4.88">it&apos;s one of the first democratic</text><text start="422.16" dur="3.28">experiments running on ethereum</text><text start="424.639" dur="2.4">yeah</text><text start="425.44" dur="4.159">i i think just think that there&apos;s a huge</text><text start="427.039" dur="5.121">opportunity santi to move a whole</text><text start="429.599" dur="5.04">ecosystem from one token one vote or one</text><text start="432.16" dur="5.039">cpu one vote schemes to one human one</text><text start="434.639" dur="4.321">vote and what i just like have a ton of</text><text start="437.199" dur="3.28">respect for with proof of humanity is</text><text start="438.96" dur="4.72">that you&apos;ve solved that foundational</text><text start="440.479" dur="5.44">building block um and and that enables</text><text start="443.68" dur="5.44">not only ubi which is the natively</text><text start="445.919" dur="5.68">integrated uh crypto economic mechanism</text><text start="449.12" dur="4.0">in in the proof of humanity dao but also</text><text start="451.599" dur="3.361">for what i&apos;m working on with quadratic</text><text start="453.12" dur="3.84">funding at get coin grants it&apos;s a it&apos;s a</text><text start="454.96" dur="3.76">building block of of what we&apos;re doing</text><text start="456.96" dur="3.28">with quadratic funding because quadratic</text><text start="458.72" dur="3.28">funding falls apart if you can make up</text><text start="460.24" dur="4.639">new identities and vote with the</text><text start="462.0" dur="4.479">mechanism so um first off i just want to</text><text start="464.879" dur="3.921">make sure that we pinch and zoom on that</text><text start="466.479" dur="3.921">and and that the audience can recognize</text><text start="468.8" dur="4.959">how much of a foundational building</text><text start="470.4" dur="6.32">block uh for upgrading digital democracy</text><text start="473.759" dur="4.241">civil resistance and and identity is um</text><text start="476.72" dur="3.36">but i&apos;m wondering if you could tell me a</text><text start="478.0" dur="5.52">little bit about the ubi side of the</text><text start="480.08" dur="4.88">coin with proof of humanity uh you know</text><text start="483.52" dur="3.2">how how does that work i think that i</text><text start="484.96" dur="4.239">think that it streams to my wallet every</text><text start="486.72" dur="4.0">block uh if i&apos;m not mistaken</text><text start="489.199" dur="2.321">that&apos;s correct uh</text><text start="490.72" dur="3.28">so</text><text start="491.52" dur="3.359">the smart contract of the uvi token is</text><text start="494.0" dur="3.039">actually</text><text start="494.879" dur="4.081">very simple it&apos;s once you get verified</text><text start="497.039" dur="3.6">on proof of humanity that means that</text><text start="498.96" dur="3.6">your address the address that you have</text><text start="500.639" dur="4.641">used for proof of humanity</text><text start="502.56" dur="6.4">is able to start accruing</text><text start="505.28" dur="5.28">uvi tokens at a rate of 1 uvi per hour</text><text start="508.96" dur="3.28">so you start accumulating actually in</text><text start="510.56" dur="3.52">real time it gets the token gets</text><text start="512.24" dur="4.4">streamed into your wallet so you it&apos;s</text><text start="514.08" dur="4.48">like a fraction of uvi per second or</text><text start="516.64" dur="4.959">every actually you will see it on</text><text start="518.56" dur="5.599">metamask updating every 15 seconds or so</text><text start="521.599" dur="4.401">when every new block is changed to the</text><text start="524.159" dur="4.561">blockchain</text><text start="526.0" dur="4.88">and the the challenge with the uei token</text><text start="528.72" dur="4.0">of course is to generate</text><text start="530.88" dur="4.16">different use cases to</text><text start="532.72" dur="4.64">generate utility and to generate an</text><text start="535.04" dur="4.32">ecosystem around it that helps</text><text start="537.36" dur="4.0">reduce the supply in order to help</text><text start="539.36" dur="5.12">everyone that is accruing uei through</text><text start="541.36" dur="5.12">proof of humanity so now we have you</text><text start="544.48" dur="3.84">know different nft projects that are</text><text start="546.48" dur="3.2">doing different kinds of games that are</text><text start="548.32" dur="2.56">burning ubi</text><text start="549.68" dur="2.56">we have</text><text start="550.88" dur="4.32">a couple of</text><text start="552.24" dur="5.599">iron bolts that accumulate ether and</text><text start="555.2" dur="6.0">generate some yield with that ether and</text><text start="557.839" dur="6.081">we use the yield to burn uvi tokens</text><text start="561.2" dur="3.759">um you know a wide range of projects</text><text start="563.92" dur="3.919">that are</text><text start="564.959" dur="5.041">coming up and being developed</text><text start="567.839" dur="4.881">that are trying to you know burn ubi</text><text start="570.0" dur="4.32">tokens and i think that as we</text><text start="572.72" dur="3.92">become much more</text><text start="574.32" dur="3.84">you know connected to the ecosystem of</text><text start="576.64" dur="2.639">ethereum as a whole</text><text start="578.16" dur="3.04">um</text><text start="579.279" dur="2.801">the the whole narrative around the ui</text><text start="581.2" dur="3.759">will get</text><text start="582.08" dur="5.759">very very interesting uh vitalik himself</text><text start="584.959" dur="6.081">he actually bought a huge chunk of uvi</text><text start="587.839" dur="5.601">tokens with his shiva inu tokens and</text><text start="591.04" dur="5.68">burned them uh he actually burned almost</text><text start="593.44" dur="5.519">the entire supply of ubi available</text><text start="596.72" dur="4.08">which was pretty cool and then he</text><text start="598.959" dur="5.201">started actually accumulating now he&apos;s</text><text start="600.8" dur="6.56">one of the ubi whales himself</text><text start="604.16" dur="5.28">so it&apos;s exciting to see that ethereum</text><text start="607.36" dur="4.32">can start addressing you know this this</text><text start="609.44" dur="4.16">social challenge of you know the thing</text><text start="611.68" dur="4.08">about ubi that excites me the most is</text><text start="613.6" dur="3.76">that it can really hold the promise of</text><text start="615.76" dur="3.759">you know addressing poverty or</text><text start="617.36" dur="5.039">addressing people that are really you</text><text start="619.519" dur="5.361">know say trying to to meet the</text><text start="622.399" dur="4.56">you know their their daily needs and</text><text start="624.88" dur="4.0">this is a way that ethereum can become</text><text start="626.959" dur="3.201">very helpful in society</text><text start="628.88" dur="2.88">right and that&apos;s one of the things as</text><text start="630.16" dur="4.08">you know i&apos;m interested in exploring on</text><text start="631.76" dur="4.079">this podcast is ways that ethereum can</text><text start="634.24" dur="2.8">create positive externalities for the</text><text start="635.839" dur="3.361">world and not just for the world but</text><text start="637.04" dur="4.0">like the everyday people in it and ubi</text><text start="639.2" dur="4.16">is this exciting mechanism because once</text><text start="641.04" dur="4.08">you get people able to pay their rent</text><text start="643.36" dur="3.96">pay their electricity bills pay their</text><text start="645.12" dur="5.36">groceries they can focus more on the</text><text start="647.32" dur="6.12">self-actualization layer of of their</text><text start="650.48" dur="5.359">human needs and less on just making ends</text><text start="653.44" dur="3.76">meet um and and i think that that&apos;s a</text><text start="655.839" dur="4.481">really interesting mechanism for</text><text start="657.2" dur="5.92">creating more human flourishing is is</text><text start="660.32" dur="4.72">ubi of the proof of humanity variety the</text><text start="663.12" dur="3.44">largest ubi experiment in the world i</text><text start="665.04" dur="4.0">just think it&apos;s so crazy that</text><text start="666.56" dur="4.48">bureaucrats uh in governments for so</text><text start="669.04" dur="3.68">long have been talking about ubi</text><text start="671.04" dur="4.32">and it seems like you&apos;ve created one of</text><text start="672.72" dur="4.32">the most successful experiments without</text><text start="675.36" dur="3.84">the backing of a nation state or funding</text><text start="677.04" dur="4.88">it with taxes</text><text start="679.2" dur="4.48">yeah that&apos;s a i&apos;m a bit shy of making a</text><text start="681.92" dur="4.159">statement like that but if you look into</text><text start="683.68" dur="6.08">the academic literature of experiments</text><text start="686.079" dur="6.401">of ubi being done since the 70s onwards</text><text start="689.76" dur="5.12">there&apos;s not a uvi experiment as large as</text><text start="692.48" dur="4.64">this one we had over 50 million dollars</text><text start="694.88" dur="4.639">worth of ubi being transacted with the</text><text start="697.12" dur="4.64">token uh almost</text><text start="699.519" dur="4.32">it&apos;s going to be 15 000 people very soon</text><text start="701.76" dur="3.84">joining the proof of humanity registry</text><text start="703.839" dur="4.481">is not a lot if you compare it with</text><text start="705.6" dur="4.72">traditional web 2 systems but with other</text><text start="708.32" dur="4.079">decentralized identity systems i think</text><text start="710.32" dur="5.36">it&apos;s growing in a very nice way</text><text start="712.399" dur="6.081">and yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s you know it&apos;s a it&apos;s</text><text start="715.68" dur="4.719">been going on for almost a year now uh</text><text start="718.48" dur="3.919">and it&apos;s uh exciting to see where this</text><text start="720.399" dur="4.88">move forwards because of the incredible</text><text start="722.399" dur="5.041">support of the entire ethereum community</text><text start="725.279" dur="4.161">amazing so can you paint me a picture of</text><text start="727.44" dur="4.24">uh where this is all going five or ten</text><text start="729.44" dur="4.56">years out what do you think that ubi</text><text start="731.68" dur="5.279">proof of humanity ecosystem will have</text><text start="734.0" dur="4.72">evolved into well definitely i hope that</text><text start="736.959" dur="3.68">we are able to</text><text start="738.72" dur="3.919">reduce some of the hurdles of what it</text><text start="740.639" dur="3.76">takes to</text><text start="742.639" dur="3.76">what it takes to do a proof of humanity</text><text start="744.399" dur="4.401">profile like right now the deposit</text><text start="746.399" dur="4.641">requirement is prohibited to a lot of</text><text start="748.8" dur="4.159">people we have a crowdfunding mechanism</text><text start="751.04" dur="4.56">but of course we want to make that way</text><text start="752.959" dur="3.361">more efficient uh hopefully you know</text><text start="755.6" dur="3.84">with</text><text start="756.32" dur="4.72">scalability layer twos will be able to</text><text start="759.44" dur="3.36">make the whole system also work with</text><text start="761.04" dur="4.56">much more friendly fees</text><text start="762.8" dur="4.719">um and trying to really start talking in</text><text start="765.6" dur="4.4">the range of millions of users and not</text><text start="767.519" dur="4.56">just thousands of users</text><text start="770.0" dur="4.88">and then there&apos;s the whole ecosystem</text><text start="772.079" dur="5.601">around ubi i&apos;m i&apos;m very supportive of</text><text start="774.88" dur="6.32">projects out there and you know either</text><text start="777.68" dur="5.92">metavirus projects or nft projects or uh</text><text start="781.2" dur="5.199">d5 projects that are looking into ways</text><text start="783.6" dur="5.76">of using their fees to burn ubi</text><text start="786.399" dur="4.721">so any project that you start the</text><text start="789.36" dur="4.24">burning ubi with</text><text start="791.12" dur="4.88">automatically becomes a project that has</text><text start="793.6" dur="5.6">solidarity with everyone receiving uvi</text><text start="796.0" dur="5.92">in the first place so it&apos;s very easy to</text><text start="799.2" dur="4.72">turn a video game or you know any kind</text><text start="801.92" dur="4.64">of entertainment or any kind of defy</text><text start="803.92" dur="4.64">system into something that has you know</text><text start="806.56" dur="4.64">solidarity with the people</text><text start="808.56" dur="4.56">the second you know it uses fees to burn</text><text start="811.2" dur="3.84">this token so</text><text start="813.12" dur="3.519">i hope to see an ecosystem of you know</text><text start="815.04" dur="4.239">applications and</text><text start="816.639" dur="4.801">and cool [ __ ] built uh around the idea</text><text start="819.279" dur="3.92">of burning uvi because</text><text start="821.44" dur="4.0">the effect that you it will have on the</text><text start="823.199" dur="4.481">users the embracement that you know it</text><text start="825.44" dur="5.04">will automatically receive the love of</text><text start="827.68" dur="5.599">the entire proof of humanity community</text><text start="830.48" dur="5.359">and uh i think that you know it&apos;s a it&apos;s</text><text start="833.279" dur="6.0">a great way of making our entertainment</text><text start="835.839" dur="5.68">hours a little bit more purposeful than</text><text start="839.279" dur="4.401">you know just you know playing a game</text><text start="841.519" dur="4.961">and that&apos;s it</text><text start="843.68" dur="4.719">amazing i um i i want to like pinch and</text><text start="846.48" dur="3.68">zoom on the ubi bit because i know that</text><text start="848.399" dur="3.921">there&apos;s people whose lives have been</text><text start="850.16" dur="4.16">changed by ubi today i asked you the</text><text start="852.32" dur="3.92">question of</text><text start="854.32" dur="4.16">what&apos;s where is it gonna be in five or</text><text start="856.24" dur="3.279">ten years and and i think that it&apos;s you</text><text start="858.48" dur="4.0">know it&apos;s interesting to think about</text><text start="859.519" dur="4.56">millions of users using using ubi but</text><text start="862.48" dur="3.359">the seed of that legitimacy for the</text><text start="864.079" dur="3.921">millions of users stories the thousands</text><text start="865.839" dur="4.161">of users who are who are using it right</text><text start="868.0" dur="3.44">now and and receiving i think in some</text><text start="870.0" dur="3.04">cases on the order of twelve hundred</text><text start="871.44" dur="3.28">dollars per month like enough to pay</text><text start="873.04" dur="3.68">their their rent and really accomplish</text><text start="874.72" dur="3.679">the goals of ubi is that more or less</text><text start="876.72" dur="4.559">accurate</text><text start="878.399" dur="4.721">yeah i mean in argentina uh where i come</text><text start="881.279" dur="3.92">from i you know of course there&apos;s a nice</text><text start="883.12" dur="4.719">community over there and a lot of people</text><text start="885.199" dur="4.721">are suddenly actually using web3 for the</text><text start="887.839" dur="4.24">first time in their lives through proof</text><text start="889.92" dur="4.4">of humanity and through researching and</text><text start="892.079" dur="4.401">wanting to learn about ubi so it&apos;s an</text><text start="894.32" dur="5.04">exciting you know onboarding mechanism</text><text start="896.48" dur="4.479">for crypto as a whole uh where you know</text><text start="899.36" dur="3.36">you don&apos;t need to have a bank account</text><text start="900.959" dur="3.761">you don&apos;t need to go through an exchange</text><text start="902.72" dur="4.239">in order to get on board into something</text><text start="904.72" dur="4.559">like proof of humanity proof of humanity</text><text start="906.959" dur="4.24">gives you like a little bit of crypto</text><text start="909.279" dur="4.641">and a little bit you know an account and</text><text start="911.199" dur="5.521">a website account and you&apos;re ready to go</text><text start="913.92" dur="5.44">and um that&apos;s a nice way of you know</text><text start="916.72" dur="5.6">starting onboarding mechanisms that are</text><text start="919.36" dur="5.76">not relying on traditional exchanges or</text><text start="922.32" dur="5.519">traditional fintech or or you know</text><text start="925.12" dur="4.399">you traffic traditional finance uh which</text><text start="927.839" dur="3.521">at the end of the day a lot of the</text><text start="929.519" dur="3.44">onboarding of crypto today is still</text><text start="931.36" dur="2.56">reliant on the traditional banking</text><text start="932.959" dur="3.361">system</text><text start="933.92" dur="4.64">so it&apos;s been a great way to onboard new</text><text start="936.32" dur="4.24">people to crypto for the first time they</text><text start="938.56" dur="4.079">are not coming you know maybe are not</text><text start="940.56" dur="3.44">even bankerized but</text><text start="942.639" dur="3.281">through this mechanism they have a</text><text start="944.0" dur="3.519">little crypto to start spending or to</text><text start="945.92" dur="3.44">start experimenting with the different</text><text start="947.519" dur="2.961">systems that they will discover in</text><text start="949.36" dur="3.68">ethereum</text><text start="950.48" dur="4.96">and the the one incredible thing about</text><text start="953.04" dur="4.159">ubi you know even though you know the</text><text start="955.44" dur="3.519">founding team we are all people that</text><text start="957.199" dur="3.601">have been living you know in a nomadic</text><text start="958.959" dur="4.24">life internationally</text><text start="960.8" dur="5.2">but actually our largest community right</text><text start="963.199" dur="5.121">now is spanish-speaking it&apos;s mostly has</text><text start="966.0" dur="4.56">been most impactful in latin america of</text><text start="968.32" dur="4.56">course we have users all over the world</text><text start="970.56" dur="4.8">but the fact that it&apos;s able to reach a</text><text start="972.88" dur="4.639">region that desperately needs crypto</text><text start="975.36" dur="3.68">desperately needs an alternative to the</text><text start="977.519" dur="4.161">to the financial system or to the</text><text start="979.04" dur="4.799">corrupt institutions in in our countries</text><text start="981.68" dur="4.399">i think it&apos;s a a great statement that</text><text start="983.839" dur="5.201">you know uvi is impacting where where it</text><text start="986.079" dur="5.041">need it&apos;s needed the most and uh i&apos;m</text><text start="989.04" dur="4.719">hopeful to see this you know growing</text><text start="991.12" dur="5.279">over the years um you know if you ask me</text><text start="993.759" dur="4.801">on a 10 year 20-year time frame</text><text start="996.399" dur="4.481">or maybe 30-year time frame a couple of</text><text start="998.56" dur="4.959">decades from now i think crypto has the</text><text start="1000.88" dur="4.8">potential to help everyone</text><text start="1003.519" dur="3.601">anywhere in the planet to be able to</text><text start="1005.68" dur="2.719">meet</text><text start="1007.12" dur="3.68">their needs</text><text start="1008.399" dur="4.8">on on everyday life like we can see</text><text start="1010.8" dur="4.56">crypto delivering global ubi for</text><text start="1013.199" dur="4.56">everyone and and to</text><text start="1015.36" dur="3.919">to me you know the the exciting thing</text><text start="1017.759" dur="3.681">about this project is that that it&apos;s</text><text start="1019.279" dur="5.201">also a level playing field technology</text><text start="1021.44" dur="5.68">the person in madagascar or mozambique</text><text start="1024.48" dur="5.599">or or in india receives the same amount</text><text start="1027.12" dur="6.24">of ubi than someone in connecticut or</text><text start="1030.079" dur="5.201">london or l.a and this level playing</text><text start="1033.36" dur="3.92">field technology is a miracle of what we</text><text start="1035.28" dur="3.519">can do with these crypto networks and</text><text start="1037.28" dur="4.0">that&apos;s the challenge you know how we can</text><text start="1038.799" dur="5.04">grow and make sure this is yeah like</text><text start="1041.28" dur="4.799">everyone is is welcome here absolutely</text><text start="1043.839" dur="3.041">everyone and that&apos;s that&apos;s the biggest</text><text start="1046.079" dur="2.24">phase</text><text start="1046.88" dur="3.28">yeah i mean i think the possible scale</text><text start="1048.319" dur="3.36">of this is just incredible given that</text><text start="1050.16" dur="4.0">anyone can participate from anywhere</text><text start="1051.679" dur="5.521">across the world so i want to drill in</text><text start="1054.16" dur="5.44">and really put a um a visceral note on</text><text start="1057.2" dur="3.599">this because i i think that you know you</text><text start="1059.6" dur="2.8">can talk about the system and you can</text><text start="1060.799" dur="2.961">talk about the numbers until the cows</text><text start="1062.4" dur="4.08">come home but until you really talk</text><text start="1063.76" dur="4.72">about the examples then i think that</text><text start="1066.48" dur="3.84">sometimes it&apos;s not completely visceral</text><text start="1068.48" dur="4.8">for everyone but like you were recently</text><text start="1070.32" dur="5.12">in uh buenos aires with vitalik</text><text start="1073.28" dur="5.04">walking around and and i know that</text><text start="1075.44" dur="6.0">there&apos;s been inflation in our uh in</text><text start="1078.32" dur="4.8">buenos aires and the pandemic and uh can</text><text start="1081.44" dur="3.52">you tell me what it was like to meet the</text><text start="1083.12" dur="3.84">users that you&apos;re affecting with this</text><text start="1084.96" dur="3.52">system and to be walking around with</text><text start="1086.96" dur="2.959">with vitalik i bet he&apos;s quite the</text><text start="1088.48" dur="3.68">celebrity down there</text><text start="1089.919" dur="4.481">it was wild you know um</text><text start="1092.16" dur="3.68">it&apos;s it&apos;s i haven&apos;t been in argentina</text><text start="1094.4" dur="3.68">since uh</text><text start="1095.84" dur="4.64">two years ago since the pandemic started</text><text start="1098.08" dur="4.56">so suddenly i go back to my country two</text><text start="1100.48" dur="3.68">years later after the pandemic</text><text start="1102.64" dur="3.039">and</text><text start="1104.16" dur="4.16">it turns out that the perfect</text><text start="1105.679" dur="5.921">combination of high inflation capital</text><text start="1108.32" dur="5.04">controls subsidized energy combined with</text><text start="1111.6" dur="3.76">the pandemic that apparently gave a lot</text><text start="1113.36" dur="4.319">of people time to learn about this stuff</text><text start="1115.36" dur="3.6">on youtube combined with a bull market</text><text start="1117.679" dur="3.841">of 21</text><text start="1118.96" dur="4.4">suddenly i arrived to buenos aires</text><text start="1121.52" dur="3.92">you know i&apos;m flying there to help</text><text start="1123.36" dur="3.12">vitalik to you know</text><text start="1125.44" dur="2.96">have an</text><text start="1126.48" dur="4.4">to have the best possible experience as</text><text start="1128.4" dur="4.88">he learns about my country and hopefully</text><text start="1130.88" dur="5.6">my country to discover this amazing</text><text start="1133.28" dur="5.44">human being vitalik buterinis and</text><text start="1136.48" dur="5.199">the first thing i realized very quickly</text><text start="1138.72" dur="6.0">is that vitalik has mick jagger status</text><text start="1141.679" dur="4.081">in argentina like crypto became really</text><text start="1144.72" dur="2.72">really</text><text start="1145.76" dur="4.64">the adoption of crypto really</text><text start="1147.44" dur="5.04">accelerated accelerated significantly</text><text start="1150.4" dur="3.6">i&apos;m used to seeing in the developer</text><text start="1152.48" dur="3.52">community you know in the hacker</text><text start="1154.0" dur="4.0">community of buenos aires i knew that we</text><text start="1156.0" dur="4.24">already had a lot of developers and a</text><text start="1158.0" dur="4.64">lot of hackers building on ethereum but</text><text start="1160.24" dur="5.36">suddenly i discovered that everyone you</text><text start="1162.64" dur="5.36">know under 30 years old in buenos aires</text><text start="1165.6" dur="4.24">is using crypto and they&apos;re using it</text><text start="1168.0" dur="4.48">because they need it not because it&apos;s a</text><text start="1169.84" dur="4.48">theoretical quirk or an opportunity to</text><text start="1172.48" dur="4.16">you know make more money they use it</text><text start="1174.32" dur="5.04">because we don&apos;t have a currency we</text><text start="1176.64" dur="5.68">don&apos;t have a legal ability to buy us</text><text start="1179.36" dur="4.64">dollars we use it because we need it we</text><text start="1182.32" dur="3.28">desperately need to use ethereum we</text><text start="1184.0" dur="3.2">desperately need to use stable coins we</text><text start="1185.6" dur="4.079">desperately need to use this technology</text><text start="1187.2" dur="5.68">for survival and the adoption of crypto</text><text start="1189.679" dur="5.761">in argentina is insane and vitalik for</text><text start="1192.88" dur="4.96">the first time i i talked about this</text><text start="1195.44" dur="4.64">with him a lot like for it&apos;s the first</text><text start="1197.84" dur="4.48">country he visits where he cannot walk</text><text start="1200.08" dur="4.16">one or two blocks without being</text><text start="1202.32" dur="4.479">recognized as someone asking him for a</text><text start="1204.24" dur="5.2">selfie like suddenly he discovered a</text><text start="1206.799" dur="5.201">kind of celebrity status or he unlocked</text><text start="1209.44" dur="3.92">a level of celebrity that is worthy of a</text><text start="1212.0" dur="2.64">hollywood star</text><text start="1213.36" dur="4.08">and</text><text start="1214.64" dur="5.12">it was very wild to see that he was</text><text

dur="4.48">more people embracing this idea building</text><text start="2019.679" dur="3.84">stuff with it and</text><text start="2021.519" dur="4.801">in a smaller way smaller scale with</text><text start="2023.519" dur="4.801">proof of humanity that the most</text><text start="2026.32" dur="3.839">satisfactory thing for me has been that</text><text start="2028.32" dur="3.68">and i&apos;m sure that you have lived through</text><text start="2030.159" dur="3.841">very similar things with you know the</text><text start="2032.0" dur="4.799">incredible growth that bitcoin had over</text><text start="2034.0" dur="4.72">over the last years supporting uh you</text><text start="2036.799" dur="4.48">know the development of these public</text><text start="2038.72" dur="5.04">goods and these incredible resources</text><text start="2041.279" dur="5.041">that we all all of us then find</text><text start="2043.76" dur="5.2">ourselves using this to build the next</text><text start="2046.32" dur="3.92">interesting experiment yeah and there&apos;s</text><text start="2048.96" dur="2.639">one thing that i want to say about that</text><text start="2050.24" dur="2.8">is that i know that there are many</text><text start="2051.599" dur="4.401">founders that kind of grinded through</text><text start="2053.04" dur="4.559">the bear market and toiled in obscurity</text><text start="2056.0" dur="3.44">through the the</text><text start="2057.599" dur="4.641">just basically years without extrinsic</text><text start="2059.44" dur="4.56">motivation and i feel a special type of</text><text start="2062.24" dur="3.119">a kinship with with those people who</text><text start="2064.0" dur="2.96">have just kind of systematically tried</text><text start="2065.359" dur="3.841">to solve this problem and one of the</text><text start="2066.96" dur="4.639">things that i really love about web3 is</text><text start="2069.2" dur="4.639">that bitcoin and proof of humanity are</text><text start="2071.599" dur="4.48">so complimentary and then i think about</text><text start="2073.839" dur="4.721">giveth and then retroactive public goods</text><text start="2076.079" dur="3.921">funding and doing good and radical drips</text><text start="2078.56" dur="4.0">and it just feels like we&apos;re building</text><text start="2080.0" dur="5.04">this pluralistic infrastructure for the</text><text start="2082.56" dur="4.72">public good where this the each of the</text><text start="2085.04" dur="4.639">our projects can can slingshot each</text><text start="2087.28" dur="4.72">other and we can all be successful and</text><text start="2089.679" dur="4.801">and to me it&apos;s just such a beautiful</text><text start="2092.0" dur="5.04">uh thing to think about how deeply this</text><text start="2094.48" dur="4.8">could scale to help humans all across</text><text start="2097.04" dur="4.48">the world but also how pluralistic it is</text><text start="2099.28" dur="3.28">it doesn&apos;t rely on any specific project</text><text start="2101.52" dur="4.559">for all</text><text start="2102.56" dur="6.0">of the success that can happen and so um</text><text start="2106.079" dur="4.481">yeah i i guess i&apos;m wondering if if your</text><text start="2108.56" dur="3.279">vision differs from mine at all like</text><text start="2110.56" dur="2.88">what does the space of regenerative</text><text start="2111.839" dur="3.76">crypto economics look like and how can</text><text start="2113.44" dur="4.88">we all help each other in order to in</text><text start="2115.599" dur="2.721">order to build it</text><text start="2118.72" dur="3.76">yeah it&apos;s when you know with web3 i</text><text start="2120.64" dur="3.76">think it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="2122.48" dur="4.4">i think i tweeted this recently like if</text><text start="2124.4" dur="5.84">you want to go fast go alone if you want</text><text start="2126.88" dur="4.64">to go far go together you know and</text><text start="2130.24" dur="3.04">in web 3</text><text start="2131.52" dur="4.64">what i found that has been incredibly</text><text start="2133.28" dur="4.799">critical for a project to succeed is you</text><text start="2136.16" dur="4.56">know where you fit in in the greater</text><text start="2138.079" dur="4.801">puzzle of everything that&apos;s going on and</text><text start="2140.72" dur="4.32">where you can make a contribution that</text><text start="2142.88" dur="4.56">is either able to compose with other</text><text start="2145.04" dur="4.64">projects or to leverage you know</text><text start="2147.44" dur="4.8">another project and contribute in a</text><text start="2149.68" dur="4.48">specific way that you know empowers not</text><text start="2152.24" dur="4.56">only your project but also the community</text><text start="2154.16" dur="4.56">as a whole and that&apos;s that&apos;s the ethos</text><text start="2156.8" dur="3.2">of open source development that&apos;s the</text><text start="2158.72" dur="3.68">ethos of</text><text start="2160.0" dur="4.96">building with a community you know not</text><text start="2162.4" dur="4.8">caring about your code or your</text><text start="2164.96" dur="4.879">intellectual property or stuff like that</text><text start="2167.2" dur="5.04">i think a lot of that logic is rendered</text><text start="2169.839" dur="4.081">obsolete when you think about you know</text><text start="2172.24" dur="4.96">how we build these networks and these</text><text start="2173.92" dur="5.679">systems and and that&apos;s an incredible way</text><text start="2177.2" dur="4.24">of building things i like at the end of</text><text start="2179.599" dur="3.921">the day you know ethereum is still a</text><text start="2181.44" dur="4.48">subset in the greater movement of open</text><text start="2183.52" dur="4.64">source and free software and</text><text start="2185.92" dur="4.8">this has been going on since you know a</text><text start="2188.16" dur="4.56">couple of decades now and it&apos;s just the</text><text start="2190.72" dur="3.28">fact that now we are you know when we</text><text start="2192.72" dur="3.359">build with crypto we&apos;re actually</text><text start="2194.0" dur="4.32">building institutions we&apos;re building the</text><text start="2196.079" dur="4.321">institutions of the future the way of</text><text start="2198.32" dur="4.72">coordination and organization</text><text start="2200.4" dur="5.12">that

it</text><text start="2207.599" dur="5.281">under a philosophy that is really not</text><text start="2210.4" dur="5.6">exactly not the philosophy of you know</text><text start="2212.88" dur="5.92">american capitalism of the 20th or 19th</text><text start="2216.0" dur="5.28">century it&apos;s a complete new way of</text><text start="2218.8" dur="4.48">understanding how we can create

dur="3.521">regard you know i&apos;m very optimistic</text><text start="2239.52" dur="3.04">about</text><text start="2240.64" dur="3.84">what when we have it you know looking at</text><text
