they&apos;re doing</text><text start="19.859" dur="5.101">community currencies on the order of 200</text><text start="21.96" dur="4.559">members in the Zurich pilot and there&apos;s</text><text start="24.96" dur="4.02">a lot of interesting things happening</text><text start="26.519" dur="5.821">here a actual data about how this stuff</text><text start="28.98" dur="7.38">is being used uh on civil resistance on</text><text start="32.34" dur="6.66">the economics on user experience and uh</text><text start="36.36" dur="5.4">we dive in and pull all of those threads</text><text start="39.0" dur="4.559">on this episode so I think that I&apos;m</text><text start="41.76" dur="3.36">really bullish on community currencies I</text><text start="43.559" dur="4.201">think there&apos;s a really a beautiful</text><text start="45.12" dur="4.56">opportunity for Community currencies to</text><text start="47.76" dur="4.619">create little pockets of value that are</text><text start="49.68" dur="5.039">oriented around local values instead of</text><text start="52.379" dur="4.261">global values that come from Global</text><text start="54.719" dur="4.02">commodified currencies like the USD or</text><text start="56.64" dur="3.48">the Euro or Bitcoin</text><text start="58.739" dur="2.64">um I think that with global currencies</text><text start="60.12" dur="2.579">you kind of get this race to the bottom</text><text start="61.379" dur="3.301">of the brain stem of things that</text><text start="62.699" dur="4.261">everyone in the world likes things like</text><text start="64.68" dur="3.54">pizza and beer and not everyone in the</text><text start="66.96" dur="2.4">world likes these things but you they&apos;re</text><text start="68.22" dur="2.88">an example of like a globally</text><text start="69.36" dur="3.299">commodified thing and so what if we</text><text start="71.1" dur="4.08">could create local community currencies</text><text start="72.659" dur="4.5">around local values whatever your local</text><text start="75.18" dur="3.9">Town values or maybe whatever your local</text><text start="77.159" dur="5.221">internet Community Values if you index</text><text start="79.08" dur="4.8">on locality of the meme space instead of</text><text start="82.38" dur="2.879">physical space so local community</text><text start="83.88" dur="2.94">currencies I think is a theme that</text><text start="85.259" dur="3.961">you&apos;ll see on the green pill podcast</text><text start="86.82" dur="4.619">over the next couple quarters

dur="5.94">Alan let&apos;s dive into uh in cointer so</text><text start="214.92" dur="5.819">tell us about uh though the why what how</text><text start="217.62" dur="9.479">of of how it works</text><text start="220.739" dur="6.36">yeah so I&apos;m going to is about</text><text start="227.159" dur="6.66">lowering inequality in the world so big</text><text start="231.18" dur="3.32">big vision of it</text><text start="233.819" dur="6.06">um</text><text start="234.5" dur="7.84">and the way it does this is by issuing a</text><text start="239.879" dur="5.181">basic income in local community</text><text start="242.34" dur="6.899">currencies</text><text start="245.06" dur="7.36">so it&apos;s in a way it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="249.239" dur="6.0">a culmination of what I observed in in</text><text start="252.42" dur="3.9">crypto what was happening that made me</text><text start="255.239" dur="4.441">think about</text><text start="256.32" dur="8.4">oh money works and</text><text start="259.68" dur="7.5">why it tends to accumulate capital on</text><text start="264.72" dur="6.68">very few people</text><text start="267.18" dur="4.22">um and how we could do it differently</text><text start="272.82" dur="2.76">all right so let&apos;s dig a little bit</text><text start="274.199" dur="3.78">deeper um</text><text start="275.58" dur="5.1">how how does it how does it work and and</text><text start="277.979" dur="4.081">how does that it change that problem</text><text start="280.68" dur="3.78">so</text><text start="282.06" dur="5.579">um if we if we wanna</text><text start="284.46" dur="6.36">issue a basic income we we want to make</text><text start="287.639" dur="5.821">sure that two things the the basic</text><text start="290.82" dur="4.62">income needs to have value real value</text><text start="293.46" dur="4.019">that people can use</text><text start="295.44" dur="4.8">um but also we we need to be</text><text start="297.479" dur="6.0">um sure that each person only gets that</text><text start="300.24" dur="8.179">income once so that&apos;s decible resistance</text><text start="303.479" dur="9.181">that we that we need and I think the key</text><text start="308.419" dur="6.821">the key contribution of of encounter is</text><text start="312.66" dur="7.08">how it solves disciple</text><text start="315.24" dur="7.2">back and that&apos;s by physical concurrent</text><text start="319.74" dur="7.44">uh key signing meetups</text><text start="322.44" dur="7.319">so if you if you want that basic income</text><text start="327.18" dur="5.579">um you need to join a community and it&apos;s</text><text start="329.759" dur="5.041">a local community so I will maybe we can</text><text start="332.759" dur="5.641">talk later about why it is important</text><text start="334.8" dur="7.679">that these are local so</text><text start="338.4" dur="5.4">you need to be at a certain place at a</text><text start="342.479" dur="4.321">certain time</text><text start="343.8" dur="5.22">every 10 days currently</text><text start="346.8" dur="4.26">um in your neighborhood so you never</text><text start="349.02" dur="5.64">have to go really far</text><text start="351.06" dur="4.56">but you need to meet a random bunch of</text><text start="354.66" dur="3.36">people</text><text start="355.62" dur="4.68">and then you just attest each other&apos;s</text><text start="358.02" dur="5.7">personhood you attest each other&apos;s</text><text start="360.3" dur="5.52">attendance of that key signing Meetup</text><text start="363.72" dur="4.5">and because all the meetups happen at</text><text start="365.82" dur="5.159">the same time you cannot attend two</text><text start="368.22" dur="6.36">meetups so that&apos;s that&apos;s really</text><text start="370.979" dur="5.821">leveraging the the physics of each</text><text start="374.58" dur="4.44">person can only be in one per in one</text><text start="376.8" dur="4.92">place at one time</text><text start="379.02" dur="5.28">and that&apos;s how we solve disable it</text><text start="381.72" dur="4.68">got it yeah I know that uh civil attacks</text><text start="384.3" dur="3.78">are a big topic on this podcast just</text><text start="386.4" dur="3.6">because one human one vote systems are</text><text start="388.08" dur="3.6">way more democratic than when Coke and</text><text start="390.0" dur="3.18">one vote systems and I think that we</text><text start="391.68" dur="3.299">learned in our Brian Ford episode that</text><text start="393.18" dur="4.62">there&apos;s four ways of creating civil</text><text start="394.979" dur="5.401">resistance there&apos;s uh kyc nation state</text><text start="397.8" dur="3.899">government uh IDs there&apos;s biometric</text><text start="400.38" dur="3.18">there&apos;s web of trust and there&apos;s</text><text start="401.699" dur="3.241">presence based so it seems like you at</text><text start="403.56" dur="5.419">least have some element of presence</text><text start="404.94" dur="9.479">based in baby web of trust in there uh</text><text start="408.979" dur="7.901">web of trust does play a minor role but</text><text start="414.419" dur="7.801">really it is it is a presence-based</text><text start="416.88" dur="8.159">protocol why why is it uh also why does</text><text start="422.22" dur="5.88">it have to do with web of trust as well</text><text start="425.039" dur="6.061">um so if if you want to join</text><text start="428.1" dur="6.599">the the community</text><text start="431.1" dur="5.939">um we always need to make sure that the</text><text start="434.699" dur="4.861">majority is honest that&apos;s just the basic</text><text start="437.039" dur="4.741">Assumption of our of our protocol the</text><text start="439.56" dur="5.82">majority can always</text><text start="441.78" dur="6.78">um bend the rules so we rely on majority</text><text start="445.38" dur="6.96">is honest and that means</text><text start="448.56" dur="7.4">we we somehow need to limit how many</text><text start="452.34" dur="6.72">people can join a new community</text><text start="455.96" dur="3.7">per cycle of</text><text start="459.06" dur="4.4">um</text><text start="459.66" dur="6.96">proof of personhood so per ceremony</text><text start="463.46" dur="5.5">and that&apos;s where we use web of trust or</text><text start="466.62" dur="4.88">kind of the social graph because we let</text><text start="468.96" dur="6.359">people invite other people</text><text start="471.5" dur="5.38">to to join the protocol</text><text start="475.319" dur="6.78">right</text><text start="476.88" dur="8.46">it&apos;s kind of three step of of a proof of</text><text start="482.099" dur="7.561">personhood or of cyber resistance</text><text start="485.34" dur="6.359">yeah other others need that as well</text><text start="489.66" dur="4.259">yeah so I mean about how many people</text><text start="491.699" dur="3.72">have been onboarded so far</text><text start="493.919" dur="4.801">so</text><text start="495.419" dur="6.96">um so far we have two communities uh one</text><text start="498.72" dur="7.819">in Zurich one in Kigali Rwanda</text><text start="502.379" dur="5.76">and in Zurich we have</text><text start="506.539" dur="5.5">a</text><text start="508.139" dur="7.7">well right now we have 200 reputables</text><text start="512.039" dur="7.981">that means 200 people who have attended</text><text start="515.839" dur="6.06">at least once during the last five</text><text start="520.02" dur="4.379">Cycles</text><text start="521.899" dur="6.361">and that&apos;s that&apos;s kind of the the the</text><text start="524.399" dur="7.201">constant population that we have now</text><text start="528.26" dur="5.56">that may seem little</text><text start="531.6" dur="6.98">um but it&apos;s it&apos;s just one</text><text start="533.82" dur="10.079">City and we started in May</text><text start="538.58" dur="8.86">and as as it can only grow by by one</text><text start="543.899" dur="5.821">third per per cycle it&apos;s just it can</text><text start="547.44" dur="4.7">really only grow organically because of</text><text start="549.72" dur="7.94">our trust assumptions</text><text start="552.14" dur="7.06">exponential over time but yeah well</text><text start="557.66" dur="3.34">days</text><text start="559.2" dur="4.8">yeah I mean I think you want to prove it</text><text start="561.0" dur="5.88">out on a small scale first and only then</text><text start="564.0" dur="4.68">kind of blow it up to web scale so I&apos;m</text><text start="566.88" dur="3.24">curious if you could if you could talk</text><text start="568.68" dur="3.599">about the proof points that you have so</text><text start="570.12" dur="5.3">far and how are the first ex how&apos;s the</text><text start="572.279" dur="3.141">first population doing</text><text start="575.519" dur="7.26">um so the the population in Zurich is</text><text start="578.519" dur="8.581">our Pioneer community and I think it has</text><text start="582.779" dur="6.981">evolved pretty decently so we had</text><text start="587.1" dur="6.06">it&apos;s especially also in terms of</text><text start="589.76" dur="5.86">who we could onboard and how people are</text><text start="593.16" dur="6.119">using it so</text><text start="595.62" dur="10.2">um we I I would say our our population</text><text start="599.279" dur="8.401">is not dominated by uh crypto fans so a</text><text start="605.82" dur="4.5">lot a lot of the people that that</text><text start="607.68" dur="4.02">participate don&apos;t care about crypto at</text><text start="610.32" dur="4.32">all</text><text start="611.7" dur="6.9">um but they care about the local</text><text start="614.64" dur="7.379">identity they care about basic income</text><text start="618.6" dur="6.179">um and and about the whole story so</text><text start="622.019" dur="5.161">as I said we started in March and we had</text><text start="624.779" dur="4.921">a First Acceptance point so what what we</text><text start="627.18" dur="4.74">issue the basic income we haven&apos;t talked</text><text start="629.7" dur="3.9">about this so far is a currency called</text><text start="631.92" dur="4.859">Loy</text><text start="633.6" dur="5.22">um which in Zurich is at par with the</text><text start="636.779" dur="4.201">Swiss franc but that&apos;s just kind of a</text><text start="638.82" dur="3.3">social agreement with the acceptance</text><text start="640.98" dur="3.12">points</text><text start="642.12" dur="7.88">so we started with one acceptance Point</text><text start="644.1" dur="8.7">that&apos;s a popular Cafe close to my office</text><text start="650.0" dur="4.36">and they they were really fond of the of</text><text start="652.8" dur="4.8">the vision and they said hey you know</text><text start="654.36" dur="5.94">what we will accept Lloyd from day one</text><text start="657.6" dur="4.739">and that&apos;s how we started so people got</text><text start="660.3" dur="4.56">a basic income and then they could go</text><text start="662.339" dur="6.0">over to the coffee and spend it on</text><text start="664.86" dur="5.88">coffee so we started with 22 Loi which</text><text start="668.339" dur="5.041">is 22 Swiss Francs in in buying power</text><text start="670.74" dur="6.12">this would buy you</text><text start="673.38" dur="4.98">five coffees or something like that</text><text start="676.86" dur="4.979">um</text><text start="678.36" dur="6.0">and then we went on from there so we we</text><text start="681.839" dur="4.74">had we started with 10 people we called</text><text start="684.36" dur="3.719">them the bootstrappers doing kind of a</text><text start="686.579" dur="4.38">uh</text><text start="688.079" dur="3.901">secure setup a trusted setup of the</text><text start="690.959" dur="4.741">community</text><text start="691.98" dur="5.72">and then we onboarded more people uh</text><text start="695.7" dur="5.16">more and more like one one-third</text><text start="697.7" dur="4.54">additional uh participants each each</text><text start="700.86" dur="4.62">time</text><text start="702.24" dur="5.279">and we had a few technical hiccups in</text><text start="705.48" dur="4.979">the in the beginning of course</text><text start="707.519" dur="6.241">um but overall it worked really smoothly</text><text start="710.459" dur="7.081">paying process was was nice at the cafe</text><text start="713.76" dur="7.5">pretty soon we had a little uh grocery</text><text start="717.54" dur="6.18">store with local products that accepted</text><text start="721.26" dur="6.3">Glory as well now we also have a little</text><text start="723.72" dur="7.98">pop-up store we have a</text><text

stuff</text><text start="738.12" dur="5.459">and I I think one one of the bigger</text><text start="740.94" dur="8.399">events was was an open air happening in</text><text start="743.579" dur="8.041">uh Zurich where you could buy drinks boy</text><text start="749.339" dur="6.18">and where we also distributed vouchers</text><text start="751.62" dur="7.159">kind of Welcome vouchers to start to</text><text start="755.519" dur="3.26">start using</text><text start="759.72" dur="3.9">got it</text><text start="761.279" dur="5.281">and I mean yeah talking about</text><text start="763.62" dur="6.6">communities I&apos;m I&apos;m really proud to say</text><text start="766.56" dur="6.54">we have now a second</text><text start="770.22" dur="5.1">um Community which started in Kigali</text><text start="773.1" dur="5.4">they started with a slightly different</text><text start="775.32" dur="5.88">concept a little bit less formal so they</text><text start="778.5" dur="4.56">they start with person to person</text><text start="781.2" dur="4.62">um trades first</text><text start="783.06" dur="6.66">it only had half kind of constant uh</text><text start="785.82" dur="6.3">acceptance points but this it is an</text><text start="789.72" dur="4.98">important milestone for me because</text><text start="792.12" dur="4.86">I mean bringing more money to Zurich is</text><text start="794.7" dur="4.68">is kind of not the point of encounter</text><text start="796.98" dur="5.58">right so it&apos;s it&apos;s not our vision</text><text start="799.38" dur="5.16">I mean if if we can you know uh further</text><text start="802.56" dur="3.2">local</text><text start="804.54" dur="3.479">um</text><text start="805.76" dur="3.519">consumption of local Goods in Zurich</text><text start="808.019" dur="3.481">that&apos;s a good thing it&apos;s a good thing</text><text start="809.279" dur="6.0">for the environment as well</text><text start="811.5" dur="6.54">um but our vision is really to to kind</text><text start="815.279" dur="5.401">of bring equal opportunity</text><text start="818.04" dur="5.7">in terms of like yeah Financial</text><text start="820.68" dur="7.2">inclusion in terms of</text><text start="823.74" dur="7.14">yeah pure buying power in in the in the</text><text start="827.88" dur="5.639">communities so having having now a pilot</text><text start="830.88" dur="4.98">in Kigali is really</text><text start="833.519" dur="5.041">it&apos;s really uh rewarding for us and</text><text start="835.86" dur="4.32">we&apos;re really curious</text><text start="838.56" dur="5.54">we&apos;ll use it</text><text start="840.18" dur="3.92">there yeah what the impact will be</text><text start="845.82" dur="4.019">yeah I wonder if you can say more about</text><text start="847.74" dur="3.42">the pilot like any just any anecdotes</text><text start="849.839" dur="2.821">that you&apos;ve heard from the people who</text><text start="851.16" dur="3.119">are in the pilot you know what are the</text><text start="852.66" dur="3.54">conditions on the ground and how have</text><text start="854.279" dur="3.481">they changed just uh just really</text><text start="856.2" dur="3.96">pinching and zooming on that pilot is</text><text start="857.76" dur="4.199">really interesting to me because if you</text><text start="860.16" dur="4.26">do bring this to web scale that&apos;s what</text><text start="861.959" dur="4.921">more people are going to experience yeah</text><text start="864.42" dur="4.02">yeah absolutely absolutely so yeah I</text><text start="866.88" dur="4.62">mean we have</text><text start="868.44" dur="6.0">I I think the interesting insights I</text><text start="871.5" dur="5.76">mean of course the technical bumps uh</text><text start="874.44" dur="4.26">can can be fun to tell as well but I</text><text start="877.26" dur="4.68">think it&apos;s it&apos;s more interesting to talk</text><text start="878.7" dur="3.84">about how people perceive it and</text><text start="881.94" dur="3.54">um</text><text start="882.54" dur="4.919">you know the first people who got a</text><text start="885.48" dur="3.719">basic income and went to the coffee and</text><text start="887.459" dur="5.281">drank their coffee</text><text start="889.199" dur="5.82">they told me you know somehow I feel bad</text><text start="892.74" dur="5.76">about drinking this coffee because I</text><text start="895.019" dur="5.88">feel like that this this Cafe uh just</text><text start="898.5" dur="6.12">gave me this coffee for free</text><text start="900.899" dur="7.44">and I told him well it&apos;s not for free at</text><text start="904.62" dur="6.54">all you know they they get money for it</text><text start="908.339" dur="4.261">and if if we establish a circular</text><text start="911.16" dur="3.06">economy</text><text start="912.6" dur="5.46">um that&apos;s that&apos;s just how they make</text><text start="914.22" dur="5.28">their turnover and you just have a right</text><text start="918.06" dur="4.139">in our</text><text start="919.5" dur="4.92">Community for a basic income that&apos;s</text><text start="922.199" dur="4.801">that&apos;s your right as part of that</text><text start="924.42" dur="4.68">community and but but it&apos;s really it&apos;s</text><text start="927.0" dur="4.139">bending people&apos;s minds</text><text start="929.1" dur="5.039">the idea of basic income and that&apos;s</text><text start="931.139" dur="5.521">that&apos;s what I really like here uh that</text><text start="934.139" dur="5.101">we can experiment with basic income</text><text start="936.66" dur="5.1">without a political process because</text><text start="939.24" dur="5.399">political processes are so slow</text><text start="941.76" dur="4.319">I I just don&apos;t have the patience for</text><text start="944.639" dur="2.88">that</text><text start="946.079" dur="2.521">um</text><text start="947.519" dur="3.12">right</text><text start="948.6" dur="4.739">so I I mean it seems like it sort of</text><text start="950.639" dur="4.081">gives a replicable model that kind of</text><text start="953.339" dur="4.981">goes around bureaucracy in these local</text><text start="954.72" dur="5.88">jurisdictions to these communities</text><text start="958.32" dur="4.5">yes well it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="960.6" dur="4.44">I mean you know there there are a lot of</text><text start="962.82" dur="5.28">challenges but it&apos;s challenges of</text><text start="965.04" dur="4.739">community building Community growth how</text><text start="968.1" dur="3.479">can you motivate people to attend</text><text start="969.779" dur="4.321">regularly</text><text start="971.579" dur="5.101">um how can you convince</text><text start="974.1" dur="5.039">store acceptance Point stores to to</text><text start="976.68" dur="6.12">accept that currency that&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="979.139" dur="5.82">work and that&apos;s what doesn&apos;t scale just</text><text start="982.8" dur="4.38">like you know if if we want to take this</text><text start="984.959" dur="4.32">to global scale</text><text start="987.18" dur="4.86">um I think the pilot can do a lot of</text><text start="989.279" dur="5.161">good in just showing that it works and</text><text start="992.04" dur="4.62">that&apos;s why we invest a lot of money and</text><text start="994.44" dur="5.759">effort now in into this pilot to just</text><text start="996.66" dur="6.359">show that it basically can work</text><text start="1000.199" dur="6.421">um but then</text><text start="1003.019" dur="7.281">we we really need just more communities</text><text start="1006.62" dur="8.279">and and and we need people on the ground</text><text start="1010.3" dur="7.479">that take the initiative and that&apos;s why</text><text start="1014.899" dur="5.701">it it might not be kind of the the</text><text start="1017.779" dur="6.18">protocol which has the the steepest</text><text start="1020.6" dur="3.959">curve of of growth</text><text start="1023.959" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="1024.559" dur="5.101">but I if if I may compare it to other</text><text start="1027.679" dur="4.14">proof of personhood approaches I just</text><text start="1029.66" dur="4.62">think it&apos;s the</text><text start="1031.819" dur="5.461">it&apos;s a very secure</text><text start="1034.28" dur="6.24">approach to cyber resistance because</text><text start="1037.28" dur="8.279">physical presence is just a lot stronger</text><text start="1040.52" dur="9.3">than an uh web of trust or then kind of</text><text start="1045.559" dur="6.561">AI hard hard challenges to solve and and</text><text start="1049.82" dur="2.3">like</text><text start="1053.799" dur="7.061">Biometrics has its other</text><text start="1057.02" dur="7.62">drawbacks with respect to privacy and</text><text start="1060.86" dur="6.059">Yeah well yeah we don&apos;t need to yeah but</text><text start="1064.64" dur="4.02">I I hear you and that&apos;s that&apos;s a whole</text><text start="1066.919" dur="3.12">other episode which should be taken</text><text start="1068.66" dur="3.24">seriously but given that you&apos;re not</text><text start="1070.039" dur="4.321">doing much biometrics</text><text start="1071.9" dur="4.62">not at all I&apos;m not going to go into it</text><text start="1074.36" dur="3.12">so I guess like</text><text start="1076.52" dur="2.94">I&apos;m</text><text start="1077.48" dur="3.72">I&apos;m a big believer in in local</text><text start="1079.46" dur="3.42">currencies because I like the idea that</text><text start="1081.2" dur="3.479">we can create local pockets of values</text><text start="1082.88" dur="4.08">around local</text><text start="1084.679" dur="4.081">um local values and I&apos;m not just talking</text><text start="1086.96" dur="3.66">about like Geographic local but like</text><text start="1088.76" dur="3.779">interest based like you know I could</text><text start="1090.62" dur="4.32">have like a keto dowel that just like</text><text start="1092.539" dur="3.601">really values uh that type of diet we</text><text start="1094.94" dur="2.7">could have a public goods Dow that</text><text start="1096.14" dur="2.64">really values public goods and this</text><text start="1097.64" dur="4.02">allows us to create these little safe</text><text start="1098.78" dur="4.38">havens away from US Dollars and Bitcoin</text><text start="1101.66" dur="4.019">which are like just race to the bottom</text><text start="1103.16" dur="4.86">of the brain stem kind of global</text><text start="1105.679" dur="5.521">commodified currencies you know beer</text><text start="1108.02" dur="4.68">insects and and like pizza are like you</text><text start="1111.2" dur="3.66">know the I think like the ultimate</text><text start="1112.7" dur="4.08">embodiment of capitalism values and and</text><text start="1114.86" dur="3.6">so I guess like I&apos;m really a believer in</text><text start="1116.78" dur="3.24">local currencies because I like the idea</text><text start="1118.46" dur="3.42">that we can have these little local</text><text start="1120.02" dur="3.779">currencies with our own GDP that have</text><text start="1121.88" dur="3.06">real value but I guess like one of the</text><text start="1123.799" dur="2.821">things that when I explain local</text><text start="1124.94" dur="2.82">currencies to people they have a</text><text start="1126.62" dur="2.64">question of is like how can a community</text><text start="1127.76" dur="4.44">currency be issued out of nothing</text><text start="1129.26" dur="3.84">quote-unquote and have real value so I</text><text start="1132.2" dur="2.28">don&apos;t know I&apos;m wondering if we could</text><text start="1133.1" dur="4.14">talk a little bit about the local</text><text start="1134.48" dur="4.8">currency design space there</text><text start="1137.24" dur="3.24">yeah very interesting</text><text start="1139.28" dur="3.18">um</text><text start="1140.48" dur="5.28">so</text><text start="1142.46" dur="6.42">I mean there have been a lot of local</text><text start="1145.76" dur="5.52">currency uh initiatives before us of</text><text start="1148.88" dur="6.539">course and um</text><text start="1151.28" dur="7.139">they usually are initiatives from a</text><text start="1155.419" dur="6.12">community uh that issues their own money</text><text start="1158.419" dur="4.5">but packs it to the to the National</text><text start="1161.539" dur="5.52">currency</text><text start="1162.919" dur="6.541">so that&apos;s really the most common way how</text><text start="1167.059" dur="4.801">people do it</text><text start="1169.46" dur="4.98">um but that also means that the local</text><text start="1171.86" dur="4.14">currencies do nothing to lower</text><text start="1174.44" dur="3.599">inequality</text><text start="1176.0" dur="4.08">because you need you need National</text><text start="1178.039" dur="4.081">currency to buy the local currency and</text><text start="1180.08" dur="5.58">then you can kind of show</text><text start="1182.12" dur="4.5">uh local identity by spending the local</text><text start="1185.66" dur="3.96">um</text><text start="1186.62" dur="6.299">uh currency and that gives yeah gives</text><text start="1189.62" dur="5.88">identity gifts kind of a status in your</text><text start="1192.919" dur="5.401">in your community</text><text start="1195.5" dur="4.44">um and that that that does fine so so</text><text start="1198.32" dur="4.68">the experience from others is really</text><text start="1199.94" dur="5.099">that it can further uh locally economy</text><text start="1203.0" dur="2.7">it can further</text><text start="1205.039" dur="3.961">um</text><text start="1205.7" dur="4.92">uh social capital in in the in in the</text><text start="1209.0" dur="4.2">community</text><text start="1210.62" dur="5.46">um but I think it&apos;s really the the basic</text><text start="1213.2" dur="5.16">income aspect of it</text><text start="1216.08" dur="5.58">um which which goes into the direction</text><text start="1218.36" dur="5.939">of really lowering equal inequality but</text><text start="1221.66" dur="6.48">your your your point is absolutely uh</text><text start="1224.299" dur="6.301">crucial if we issue a basic income who</text><text start="1228.14" dur="5.52">pays for that for it or or why does it</text><text start="1230.6" dur="5.459">have value because there is no there is</text><text start="1233.66" dur="3.72">no Central Bank that issues Deloitte</text><text start="1236.059" dur="2.301">here in Zurich</text><text start="1237.38" dur="2.52">um</text><text start="1238.36" dur="6.52">so</text><text start="1239.9" dur="8.22">no one backs this currency with uh with</text><text start="1244.88" dur="9.0">gold or with Swiss Francs</text><text start="1248.12" dur="9.299">um but we do back it by social contracts</text><text start="1253.88" dur="6.48">so the acceptance point that we have</text><text start="1257.419" dur="6.061">so it&apos;s it&apos;s more like a a you well</text><text start="1260.36" dur="5.64">basically in theory there are I guess</text><text start="1263.48" dur="5.22">two approaches you can you can pack your</text><text start="1266.0" dur="5.88">your uh your um</text><text start="1268.7" dur="4.92">currency to a basket of goods for</text><text start="1271.88" dur="3.48">example the baker could say you can</text><text start="1273.62" dur="5.34">always have a loaf of bread for that</text><text start="1275.36" dur="5.64">amount of that currency and then the I</text><text start="1278.96" dur="4.38">don&apos;t know the butcher says you you will</text><text start="1281.0" dur="3.66">always get that amount of meat and and</text><text start="1283.34" dur="2.579">so on</text><text start="1284.66" dur="4.56">um</text><text start="1285.919" dur="5.041">and that would give real value to that</text><text start="1289.22" dur="4.079">local currency because you can go to</text><text start="1290.96" dur="4.079">those stores who make a commitment and</text><text start="1293.299" dur="3.141">get something for it so it does have</text><text start="1295.039" dur="7.02">real value</text><text start="1296.44" dur="9.46">this is a rather complicated approach so</text><text start="1302.059" dur="7.921">we first wanted to try to kind of have</text><text start="1305.9" dur="5.639">the Loy at par with uh with with the</text><text start="1309.98" dur="6.12">national currency because we need to</text><text start="1311.539" dur="7.02">explain less Concepts to the community</text><text start="1316.1" dur="5.1">uh and therefore it is really the</text><text start="1318.559" dur="6.6">acceptance points that</text><text start="1321.2" dur="6.599">that maintain this Peg as long as they</text><text start="1325.159" dur="5.281">accept the peg of one lawyers one Swiss</text><text start="1327.799" dur="4.62">franc when they accept the currency</text><text start="1330.44" dur="4.46">that&apos;s the real value that the currency</text><text start="1332.419" dur="2.481">will have</text><text start="1335.419" dur="4.26">got it so it seems like there&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1337.88" dur="4.14">this virtuous cycle between the social</text><text start="1339.679" dur="4.081">contract and people actually using the</text><text start="1342.02" dur="3.539">currency it almost feels like Network</text><text start="1343.76" dur="3.24">effects to me where the more people use</text><text start="1345.559" dur="3.421">the currency the more people accept it</text><text start="1347.0" dur="3.72">as legitimate then the more people use</text><text start="1348.98" dur="3.179">the currency and it kind of spins from</text><text start="1350.72" dur="3.24">there I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m saying back to</text><text start="1352.159" dur="2.941">you exactly in the words what what you</text><text start="1353.96" dur="3.12">said to me but that&apos;s kind of how I</text><text start="1355.1" dur="4.62">interpret it is absolutely absolutely</text><text start="1357.08" dur="6.42">absolutely yeah but I mean we should</text><text start="1359.72" dur="6.72">keep in mind that this only works if we</text><text start="1363.5" dur="6.179">if we can establish a circular economy</text><text start="1366.44" dur="5.099">because if our acceptance Point accepts</text><text start="1369.679" dur="5.101">the currency but the currency will</text><text start="1371.539" dur="6.421">always stay there it will just Stack Up</text><text start="1374.78" dur="5.7">and that that is not in the interest uh</text><text start="1377.96" dur="6.18">of of of of the acceptance point because</text><text start="1380.48" dur="7.559">what what we should mention here is</text><text start="1384.14" dur="5.94">um like other local currencies do uh and</text><text start="1388.039" dur="5.161">pointer has</text><text start="1390.08" dur="6.18">built into its money design a concept</text><text start="1393.2" dur="7.26">called The Mirage so the the local</text><text start="1396.26" dur="7.68">currency loses its face value over time</text><text start="1400.46" dur="5.219">and that is an important concept to</text><text start="1403.94" dur="5.219">understand because</text><text start="1405.679" dur="5.761">if so the example and and the the</text><text start="1409.159" dur="5.88">devaluation also continues when the</text><text start="1411.44" dur="6.119">money is at the acceptance point so if</text><text start="1415.039" dur="5.101">you have money in your pocket that loses</text><text start="1417.559" dur="4.74">value over time you want to spend it as</text><text start="1420.14" dur="4.62">quickly as possible because today you</text><text start="1422.299" dur="4.981">can get more for it than tomorrow and</text><text start="1424.76" dur="6.12">that&apos;s exactly why local community</text><text start="1427.28" dur="6.42">currencies work it&apos;s because they have a</text><text start="1430.88" dur="5.82">yield a higher money velocity</text><text start="1433.7" dur="5.16">so you can do more turn around with the</text><text start="1436.7" dur="4.56">same amount of money</text><text start="1438.86" dur="5.88">but that also means that the acceptance</text><text start="1441.26" dur="5.76">point doesn&apos;t want to keep the the Hot</text><text start="1444.74" dur="4.5">Potato in his hands for very long so</text><text start="1447.02" dur="3.24">they want to get rid of it so they</text><text start="1449.24" dur="4.679">should</text><text start="1450.26" dur="7.32">be able to give to pay their suppliers</text><text start="1453.919" dur="6.12">or or maybe their staff uh in in that</text><text start="1457.58" dur="5.36">currency such that the Cur the currency</text><text start="1460.039" dur="6.901">can circulate the hold</text><text start="1462.94" dur="5.619">and just well if I if I may put that</text><text start="1466.94" dur="4.859">side note</text><text start="1468.559" dur="5.161">um we talked about the the the basic</text><text start="1471.799" dur="5.341">income and why</text><text start="1473.72" dur="6.3">um and and who pays for it actually it</text><text start="1477.14" dur="6.0">is this the Mirage which basically pays</text><text start="1480.02" dur="5.519">for the basic income so because we we</text><text start="1483.14" dur="6.36">burn money exponentially in your wallet</text><text start="1485.539" dur="6.481">we burn the money where it is not used</text><text start="1489.5" dur="7.08">and we distribute it</text><text start="1492.02" dur="7.62">to all the humans in this um community</text><text start="1496.58" dur="8.099">so it&apos;s in a way it is the demorage that</text><text start="1499.64" dur="7.38">pays for the basic income and by doing</text><text start="1504.679" dur="5.161">so it also makes sure that the money</text><text start="1507.02" dur="5.34">supply will be in proportion to the to</text><text start="1509.84" dur="5.52">the population so it&apos;s not kind of an</text><text start="1512.36" dur="5.1">inflationary design that with each basic</text><text start="1515.36" dur="4.98">income that is issued the money supply</text><text start="1517.46" dur="4.74">Will Will just raise forever but because</text><text start="1520.34" dur="4.319">we have the Mirage there will be an</text><text start="1522.2" dur="5.219">equilibrium which is</text><text start="1524.659" dur="4.441">um proportional to the to the to the</text><text start="1527.419" dur="3.601">population</text><text start="1529.1" dur="3.54">and just for listeners who aren&apos;t super</text><text start="1531.02" dur="4.44">familiar with demorage what&apos;s the</text><text start="1532.64" dur="4.68">simplest way of explaining that</text><text start="1535.46" dur="3.24">it&apos;s</text><text start="1537.32" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="1538.7" dur="6.479">so</text><text start="1540.44" dur="6.66">you if today you have 10 Loy in your</text><text start="1545.179" dur="5.461">wallet</text><text start="1547.1" dur="6.3">um deloy has a halfing time of a year so</text><text start="1550.64" dur="4.8">that means if you just do nothing</text><text start="1553.4" dur="4.5">today in your wallet you see a balance</text><text start="1555.44" dur="4.859">of 10 if you wait for a year you will</text><text start="1557.9" dur="6.54">see a balance of five</text><text start="1560.299" dur="7.26">and it will still be five Swiss Francs</text><text start="1564.44" dur="6.06">buying power most likely where it was 10</text><text start="1567.559" dur="5.881">Swiss Francs buying power a year ago</text><text start="1570.5" dur="5.299">So that&apos;s its exponential decay in your</text><text start="1573.44" dur="2.359">wallet</text><text start="1576.76" dur="4.659">got it okay</text><text start="1579.74" dur="4.14">um yeah I think the analogy that I think</text><text start="1581.419" dur="5.041">that I I learned about demaraj with was</text><text start="1583.88" dur="4.02">like rice or basically like where if you</text><text start="1586.46" dur="2.76">have 100 units of rice and you expect</text><text start="1587.9" dur="4.56">that a certain amount of them are going</text><text start="1589.22" dur="4.459">to spoil uh on a weekly basis then you</text><text start="1592.46" dur="3.9">have 99</text><text start="1593.679" dur="5.201">uh after if one percent spoil on a</text><text start="1596.36" dur="4.26">weekly basis so that&apos;s like my analogy</text><text start="1598.88" dur="3.48">in my head for demaresh that that&apos;s</text><text start="1600.62" dur="5.039">that&apos;s actually where the word comes</text><text start="1602.36" dur="6.12">from because if if you if you if you are</text><text start="1605.659" dur="6.0">a Trader of fresh goods you need to</text><text start="1608.48" dur="6.48">account for for yeah for all the rotten</text><text start="1611.659" dur="6.841">uh produce that you that you have over</text><text start="1614.96" dur="7.02">time and and I I really like this</text><text start="1618.5" dur="6.179">analogy because money is well one one of</text><text start="1621.98" dur="4.98">the of the only things in in the world</text><text start="1624.679" dur="4.5">that we have in our lives that that</text><text start="1626.96" dur="4.68">doesn&apos;t that is not perishable</text><text start="1629.179" dur="6.62">everything else is perishable</text><text start="1631.64" dur="4.159">and and yeah why not money</text><text start="1636.02" dur="3.96">I guess I&apos;m curious</text><text start="1637.76" dur="3.84">um I have in my notes here that you know</text><text start="1639.98" dur="4.079">y&apos;all have launched a Pioneer Community</text><text start="1641.6" dur="4.62">with 200 members in Zurich and there&apos;s a</text><text start="1644.059" dur="4.081">launch that just happened in Rwanda in</text><text start="1646.22" dur="4.02">November 10th it&apos;s obviously very early</text><text start="1648.14" dur="4.019">we&apos;re recording this November 29th it&apos;s</text><text start="1650.24" dur="3.539">very early to ask this question but do</text><text start="1652.159" dur="5.661">you see any similarities or differences</text><text start="1653.779" dur="4.041">in these two very different geographies</text><text start="1659.779" dur="5.76">um well it is really early to ask I mean</text><text start="1664.159" dur="5.281">um yeah</text><text start="1665.539" dur="8.581">we well we have talked to the to the to</text><text start="1669.44" dur="7.38">the leader in um Kigali about about how</text><text start="1674.12" dur="6.38">how we approach how how we tell the</text><text start="1676.82" dur="3.68">story and the stories</text><text start="1681.559" dur="3.72">just to know for the listeners Kigali is</text><text start="1683.539" dur="4.561">in Rwanda that&apos;s the second pilot there</text><text start="1685.279" dur="4.02">good continue yeah</text><text start="1688.1" dur="3.059">um</text><text start="1689.299" dur="4.86">so</text><text start="1691.159" dur="3.0">well</text><text start="1694.46" dur="5.819">I I think it&apos;s it&apos;s harder there also</text><text start="1697.58" dur="4.74">because of uh legislation so we</text><text start="1700.279" dur="4.561">shouldn&apos;t forget that well if you&apos;re in</text><text start="1702.32" dur="5.339">in different jurisdictions</text><text start="1704.84" dur="7.079">um it will be very different how how</text><text start="1707.659" dur="6.421">governments will will receive such uh</text><text start="1711.919" dur="5.64">local community currencies</text><text start="1714.08" dur="8.52">um although I I mean I have to say</text><text start="1717.559" dur="8.281">a crypto ban usually is is um motivated</text><text start="1722.6" dur="5.34">by governments who who don&apos;t want</text><text start="1725.84" dur="3.719">Capital to flee the country and you</text><text start="1727.94" dur="4.38">cannot do that with a local currency so</text><text start="1729.559" dur="5.461">I don&apos;t really think we yeah we need to</text><text start="1732.32" dur="5.219">be careful in how we compare there</text><text start="1735.02" dur="5.519">um but definitely jurisdiction and and</text><text start="1737.539" dur="5.701">kind of uh talking to the government is</text><text start="1740.539" dur="6.24">really really important for our leader</text><text start="1743.24" dur="5.22">in in Rwanda because I mean</text><text start="1746.779" dur="3.841">he is</text><text start="1748.46" dur="4.44">um he&apos;s taking risks</text><text start="1750.62" dur="4.799">uh because because of this legal</text><text start="1752.9" dur="5.82">uncertainty there and that that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="1755.419" dur="7.201">why the the that Community starts I</text><text start="1758.72" dur="7.62">would say really as a low-key experiment</text><text start="1762.62" dur="5.58">um not not kind of not with waving flags</text><text start="1766.34" dur="5.52">and calling the revolution you know yeah</text><text start="1768.2" dur="5.459">it&apos;s not it&apos;s not how things will be</text><text start="1771.86" dur="3.72">approached there</text><text start="1773.659" dur="4.561">um in in Zurich we can act differently</text><text start="1775.58" dur="6.78">you know we can we can be more bold on</text><text start="1778.22" dur="9.78">our on our Ambitions and our greatest</text><text start="1782.36" dur="9.36">fear is how how the the the tax uh</text><text start="1788.0" dur="5.64">officials will will act on it and</text><text start="1791.72" dur="3.179">so that&apos;s that&apos;s just a different level</text><text start="1793.64" dur="3.659">of</text><text start="1794.899" dur="4.38">we we don&apos;t need to fear to go to prison</text><text start="1797.299" dur="3.061">you know</text><text start="1799.279" dur="4.38">right</text><text start="1800.36" dur="6.84">um but yeah apart from that really I I</text><text start="1803.659" dur="7.5">cannot tell how how different people</text><text start="1807.2" dur="7.32">will use their local currencies and we</text><text start="1811.159" dur="5.64">want to give as much Freedom as</text><text start="1814.52" dur="6.0">possible</text><text start="1816.799" dur="7.26">um so we support the community as so as</text><text start="1820.52" dur="5.639">the encounter Association uh we have a</text><text start="1824.059" dur="5.641">little bit of means to support</text><text start="1826.159" dur="6.0">um the new communities and we do so as</text><text start="1829.7" dur="5.16">unconditionally as possible because we</text><text start="1832.159" dur="4.861">we think they know best how how they</text><text start="1834.86" dur="4.14">need to allocate the funds and we don&apos;t</text><text start="1837.02" dur="5.34">want to</text><text start="1839.0" dur="6.539">um mess too much with how they do it and</text><text start="1842.36" dur="5.76">how the money has to work for them so I</text><text start="1845.539" dur="6.181">think we just Supply the protocol we</text><text start="1848.12" dur="6.84">Supply technical support and and kind of</text><text start="1851.72" dur="5.22">a minimum minimum starting funds and</text><text start="1854.96" dur="4.68">then and then we hope that people just</text><text start="1856.94" dur="6.239">are motivated enough take the initiative</text><text start="1859.64" dur="5.1">and do something which works for them</text><text start="1863.179" dur="3.841">hmm</text><text start="1864.74" dur="4.14">beautiful well I can&apos;t wait to have you</text><text start="1867.02" dur="3.84">back in a couple years and just see how</text><text start="1868.88" dur="3.299">the experiments have grown and you&apos;ll</text><text start="1870.86" dur="3.179">probably have a lot more data points at</text><text start="1872.179" dur="4.38">that point so</text><text start="1874.039" dur="5.221">um the the tracking is interesting so</text><text start="1876.559" dur="4.5">far and uh is there anything that I</text><text start="1879.26" dur="7.08">didn&apos;t ask you that you want to say</text><text start="1881.059" dur="8.821">yeah well I mean maybe maybe I can just</text><text start="1886.34" dur="6.24">tell about our next next steps towards</text><text start="1889.88" dur="5.88">um our our vision so</text><text start="1892.58" dur="6.839">I think we have two two more big topics</text><text start="1895.76" dur="7.2">apart from adoption and one is democracy</text><text start="1899.419" dur="6.36">so as as we have a a cyber resistance in</text><text start="1902.96" dur="4.4">place uh we want to establish one person</text><text start="1905.779" dur="4.681">one vote</text><text start="1907.36" dur="6.1">subsidiary democracy which means that</text><text start="1910.46" dur="5.459">every decision should be taken at the</text><text start="1913.46" dur="5.219">lowest possible level so</text><text start="1915.919" dur="4.801">our first vote as an example will</text><text start="1918.679" dur="4.74">probably be how high should the basic</text><text start="1920.72" dur="4.38">income be in our community and then we</text><text start="1923.419" dur="3.48">let people vote on that</text><text start="1925.1" dur="3.78">which I think is a pretty interesting</text><text start="1926.899" dur="5.421">question to ask and it&apos;s kind of the</text><text start="1928.88" dur="6.36">fear of every Central Banker to to</text><text start="1932.32" dur="4.359">submit this to a democratic process but</text><text start="1935.24" dur="5.76">I think it will be an interesting</text><text start="1936.679" dur="6.24">experiment and we we are concluding the</text><text start="1941.0" dur="5.279">minimum viable product to to really have</text><text start="1942.919" dur="6.961">kind of Unchained democracy doing that</text><text start="1946.279" dur="7.201">um so that&apos;s one thing and the other is</text><text start="1949.88" dur="6.12">um privacy so right now we are a</text><text start="1953.48" dur="6.179">substrate based protocol running on</text><text start="1956.0" dur="7.74">polka dot well kusama to be precise</text><text start="1959.659" dur="6.421">um and everything is transparent and um</text><text start="1963.74" dur="6.179">so</text><text start="1966.08" dur="5.64">this is an issue uh because local</text><text start="1969.919" dur="3.541">currencies are used for everyday</text><text start="1971.72" dur="3.179">purchases</text><text start="1973.46" dur="4.62">and</text><text start="1974.899" dur="4.861">you have to register for these Cycles to</text><text start="1978.08" dur="3.479">prove your personhood that means you</text><text start="1979.76" dur="3.659">commit to be in a certain place at a</text><text start="1981.559" dur="6.541">certain time in advance</text><text start="1983.419" dur="7.201">and that&apos;s kind of an added risk it&apos;s a</text><text start="1988.1" dur="6.419">security risk but also it&apos;s kind of it</text><text start="1990.62" dur="6.6">really leaks uh even future Behavior Uh</text><text start="1994.519" dur="4.741">about yourself and that&apos;s why we take</text><text start="1997.22" dur="6.179">privacy seriously</text><text start="1999.26" dur="6.539">and we are now working on a</text><text start="2003.399" dur="4.561">on a second layer solution which not</text><text start="2005.799" dur="5.041">only helps us with with</text><text start="2007.96" dur="5.579">um scalability so that kind of each</text><text start="2010.84" dur="6.3">Community can can scale independently of</text><text start="2013.539" dur="6.061">others but also helps with privacy</text><text start="2017.14" dur="5.34">um because these second layers will</text><text start="2019.6" dur="4.74">run with trusted execution environments</text><text start="2022.48" dur="4.919">I don&apos;t want to go too deep into into</text><text start="2024.34" dur="5.76">Tech uh here but it&apos;s it&apos;s just one of</text><text start="2027.399" dur="5.701">the options to provide privacy to</text><text start="2030.1" dur="3.0">transactions</text><text start="2034.179" dur="5.161">got it so that&apos;s what&apos;s on the roadmap</text><text start="2035.679" dur="4.86">next uh more focuses on democracy and</text><text start="2039.34" dur="3.42">privacy</text><text start="2040.539" dur="5.101">yeah Tech that&apos;s especially the the</text><text start="2042.76" dur="4.86">technical roadmap here but I think more</text><text start="2045.64" dur="4.739">more important than Tech is really is</text><text start="2047.62" dur="4.92">really Community work uh and adoption</text><text start="2050.379" dur="5.881">because in the end this will</text><text start="2052.54" dur="5.04">this will decide uh if we get to fly or</text><text start="2056.26" dur="3.119">not</text><text start="2057.58" dur="3.66">yeah</text><text start="2059.379" dur="4.201">well thanks so much for coming on the</text><text start="2061.24" dur="3.139">Pod how can people
