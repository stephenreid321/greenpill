start="68.64" dur="5.339">and this paper for me was like the light</text><text start="70.979" dur="4.861">it showed me that civil resistance in a</text><text start="73.979" dur="3.901">democratic and decentralized way was</text><text start="75.84" dur="3.959">possible and it was kind of like a light</text><text start="77.88" dur="3.599">in the darkness that served as the</text><text start="79.799" dur="3.601">foundation of the Civil resistant</text><text start="81.479" dur="4.081">architecture that that I built into</text><text start="83.4" dur="4.02">early get coin and now with

start with from</text><text start="280.56" dur="4.579">the top and let&apos;s dive in on the deep</text><text start="281.759" dur="3.38">end how did you get into crypto</text><text start="285.84" dur="6.78">um so I&apos;m I&apos;m from Brazil and I&apos;ve been</text><text start="290.22" dur="5.46">working with Civic technology uh since</text><text start="292.62" dur="5.88">2015 so for the past seven years</text><text start="295.68" dur="5.64">and I learned about crypto in 2017 and</text><text start="298.5" dur="5.04">it was exactly at a point in which I was</text><text start="301.32" dur="4.98">pretty disappointed with the Civic tax</text><text start="303.54" dur="6.3">base for many reasons</text><text start="306.3" dur="5.22">um one I was sort of had been on this</text><text start="309.84" dur="5.52">project to work on a participatory</text><text start="311.52" dur="6.0">budgeting process uh with my hometown uh</text><text start="315.36" dur="3.839">in multiple neighborhoods and it was</text><text start="317.52" dur="3.959">very frustrating the process the project</text><text start="319.199" dur="4.34">ended up not happening because of sort</text><text start="321.479" dur="4.141">of micropolitical</text><text start="323.539" dur="5.5">competitions between different offices</text><text start="325.62" dur="4.799">in the city and so I was very</text><text start="329.039" dur="5.401">um</text><text start="330.419" dur="6.78">just hopeless in my ability to exert a</text><text start="334.44" dur="5.16">positive impact within the governmental</text><text start="337.199" dur="4.321">institutions that were around me so in</text><text start="339.6" dur="4.68">that sense you know it was a bit of like</text><text start="341.52" dur="5.7">an exitocracy</text><text start="344.28" dur="5.1">um there was an exotocracy flavor to it</text><text start="347.22" dur="5.22">in that I was you know frustrated with</text><text start="349.38" dur="5.099">my government of Institutions and saw in</text><text start="352.44" dur="3.9">crypto an opportunity to do some</text><text start="354.479" dur="2.541">interesting things</text><text start="356.34" dur="3.299">um</text><text start="357.02" dur="3.519">although I say that you know it was not</text><text start="359.639" dur="3.06">sort of</text><text start="360.539" dur="4.5">thinking about how is it that we can</text><text start="362.699" dur="4.381">create entirely new</text><text start="365.039" dur="3.481">um institutions on crypto land and</text><text start="367.08" dur="2.88">forget about the institutions of the</text><text start="368.52" dur="3.42">past it was more like</text><text start="369.96" dur="4.98">how is it that</text><text start="371.94" dur="5.94">um we can use this space where the</text><text start="374.94" dur="4.92">stakes are lower to do experiments that</text><text start="377.88" dur="4.68">then and learn things and then later</text><text start="379.86" dur="4.74">these things can be implemented by by</text><text start="382.56" dur="3.66">governments one of the things I think is</text><text start="384.6" dur="3.24">kind of interesting is that a lot of</text><text start="386.22" dur="3.0">people have on this podcast I talked to</text><text start="387.84" dur="3.18">in general we talk about what got you</text><text start="389.22" dur="3.18">into crypto and then we talk about what</text><text start="391.02" dur="2.94">got you into like public goods and what</text><text start="392.4" dur="3.9">got you into regen and green pill after</text><text start="393.96" dur="3.72">that but when I hear your story I hear</text><text start="396.3" dur="3.72">that you&apos;re interested in doing</text><text start="397.68" dur="3.66">something from a Civic engagement public</text><text start="400.02" dur="3.299">goods perspective in your local</text><text start="401.34" dur="3.479">community and you got frustrated by the</text><text start="403.319" dur="4.621">bureaucracy and that&apos;s what brought you</text><text start="404.819" dur="5.22">into crypto so I guess like you know I</text><text start="407.94" dur="4.92">guess what is what is the the sort of</text><text start="410.039" dur="5.16">heart of your Insight or interest in</text><text start="412.86" dur="5.279">Civic Tech in in in local community</text><text start="415.199" dur="4.981">engagement and uh you know I guess I&apos;d</text><text start="418.139" dur="4.021">love to pull that thread in and ask how</text><text start="420.18" dur="5.1">you even got started doing that I think</text><text start="422.16" dur="5.46">that I I always thought about power and</text><text start="425.28" dur="4.199">information instead of how</text><text start="427.62" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="429.479" dur="2.901">hiding information manipulating</text><text start="431.46" dur="3.78">information</text><text start="432.38" dur="5.92">exploiting information asymmetries are</text><text start="435.24" dur="5.399">all very Central to how power operates</text><text start="438.3" dur="4.799">and I think that at the time I was</text><text start="440.639" dur="6.0">looking at the protests in 2013 2014</text><text start="443.099" dur="6.6">2015 I was thinking about how</text><text start="446.639" dur="4.141">social media played a key role in all of</text><text start="449.699" dur="3.421">them it was sort of the common</text><text start="450.78" dur="3.78">denominator across of this protests</text><text start="453.12" dur="3.56">which were in different countries and</text><text start="454.56" dur="5.22">sort of triggered for different reasons</text><text start="456.68" dur="4.959">but in some ways what was common to them</text><text start="459.78" dur="2.46">was that</text><text start="461.639" dur="2.881">um</text><text start="462.24" dur="3.66">we had this new</text><text start="464.52" dur="4.86">um</text><text start="465.9" dur="6.84">this we have this new</text><text start="469.38" dur="5.46">um channels to reach information uh</text><text start="472.74" dur="4.26">started to flow much more abundantly</text><text start="474.84" dur="5.28">around society and people could connect</text><text start="477.0" dur="5.819">much more with each other and that had</text><text start="480.12" dur="6.419">very clear political repercussions not</text><text start="482.819" dur="7.261">to oversimplify things but uh technology</text><text start="486.539" dur="6.6">was a factor a key factor in all of</text><text start="490.08" dur="4.98">these protests and so when I was looking</text><text start="493.139" dur="5.041">at them what</text><text start="495.06" dur="4.859">you know there are many ways in which I</text><text start="498.18" dur="3.12">don&apos;t mean to say that more technology</text><text start="499.919" dur="4.381">and more transparency and more</text><text start="501.3" dur="5.16">connection equals more democracy</text><text start="504.3" dur="4.679">um but</text><text start="506.46" dur="4.919">um and in many ways more technology</text><text start="508.979" dur="4.5">makes it so that power is even more</text><text start="511.379" dur="4.501">concentrated and there are many other</text><text start="513.479" dur="4.261">challenges uh one thing that is very</text><text start="515.88" dur="4.44">Vivid to me right now is this question</text><text start="517.74" dur="6.599">of how when a new information technology</text><text start="520.32" dur="6.0">is created or is adopted widely you have</text><text start="524.339" dur="4.381">this phenomenon called epistemic</text><text start="526.32" dur="3.42">fragmentation where</text><text start="528.72" dur="3.799">um</text><text start="529.74" dur="7.26">you just have multiple sort of almost</text><text start="532.519" dur="7.121">unreconcilable World Views and uh</text><text start="537.0" dur="4.98">emerging and and this sense of epistemic</text><text start="539.64" dur="3.36">fragmentation is very Vivid to me right</text><text start="541.98" dur="3.0">now because we&apos;re going through</text><text start="543.0" dur="4.32">elections here in Brazil and it&apos;s just</text><text start="544.98" dur="5.82">very clear how the gap between World</text><text start="547.32" dur="6.42">Views is so so wide that there is it&apos;s</text><text start="550.8" dur="4.86">just almost impossible for uh people</text><text start="553.74" dur="3.48">with different World Views to even be</text><text start="555.66" dur="4.5">able to talk to each other</text><text start="557.22" dur="5.46">so there are many</text><text start="560.16" dur="6.48">um challenges that new technologies uh</text><text start="562.68" dur="6.18">pose but I was what I was interested in</text><text start="566.64" dur="4.319">was trying to understand how is it that</text><text start="568.86" dur="4.74">we could use the affordances of</text><text start="570.959" dur="6.421">technology to try to to put them to use</text><text start="573.6" dur="6.72">for democracy for better</text><text start="577.38" dur="5.28">um Collective organizing better</text><text start="580.32" dur="6.06">um governance of</text><text start="582.66" dur="4.98">shared goods and better deliberation I</text><text start="586.38" dur="3.3">mean there&apos;s so many things that you</text><text start="587.64" dur="4.52">that you could can do with new</text><text start="589.68" dur="5.94">technology so I I was interested in</text><text start="592.16" dur="6.22">exploring that and building uh towards</text><text start="595.62" dur="7.02">that uh and I think that that&apos;s even</text><text start="598.38" dur="6.959">a way of trying to mitigate a rise to to</text><text start="602.64" dur="5.04">the challenges that technology itself is</text><text start="605.339" dur="3.961">also now posing</text><text start="607.68" dur="3.12">um I want to talk about this paper who</text><text start="609.3" dur="4.38">watches the Watchman which is a review</text><text start="610.8" dur="5.4">of uh proof of personhood protocols in</text><text start="613.68" dur="4.02">web3 but before I do I guess I had one</text><text start="616.2" dur="2.88">more question about the the sort of</text><text start="617.7" dur="3.12">prehistory of your work here and and</text><text start="619.08" dur="4.02">that&apos;s it why do you think that thesis</text><text start="620.82" dur="4.139">of web 2 being good for democracy didn&apos;t</text><text start="623.1" dur="3.72">play out uh you know we have more</text><text start="624.959" dur="3.361">information spread across the world that</text><text start="626.82" dur="3.48">should increase the knowledge spread</text><text start="628.32" dur="3.24">that should increase the the trust</text><text start="630.3" dur="3.539">spread and that should increase</text><text start="631.56" dur="3.54">democracy everywhere but instead we kind</text><text start="633.839" dur="2.881">of it feels like we got this like</text><text start="635.1" dur="2.82">poisoning the well effect where</text><text start="636.72" dur="3.0">everyone&apos;s in their own little</text><text start="637.92" dur="2.94">Collective filter Bubbles and they only</text><text start="639.72" dur="4.02">see anything that hits their</text><text start="640.86"

not</text><text start="656.7" dur="3.72">worked out and what is there to learn</text><text start="657.899" dur="4.141">for from that when it comes to working</text><text start="660.42" dur="4.979">on it in web 3.</text><text start="662.04" dur="5.16">well there are many things and I of</text><text start="665.399" dur="4.141">course don&apos;t have the definitive answer</text><text start="667.2" dur="4.86">but one of the one of the questions is</text><text start="669.54" dur="3.359">what we what I was mentioning</text><text start="672.06" dur="3.6">um</text><text start="672.899" dur="4.62">the epistemic fragmentation</text><text start="675.66" dur="3.78">um but I think that what&apos;s that really</text><text start="677.519" dur="6.0">indicative of is that there is a</text><text start="679.44" dur="7.92">misalignment between uh what we want out</text><text start="683.519" dur="6.481">of technology and the private incentives</text><text start="687.36" dur="5.4">that the technologies that we use are</text><text start="690.0" dur="6.72">built to cater to</text><text start="692.76" dur="4.92">um the private interests so</text><text start="696.72" dur="2.94">um</text><text start="697.68" dur="4.74">what we need is</text><text start="699.66" dur="5.82">digital public infrastructure digital</text><text start="702.42" dur="5.52">public goods that are</text><text start="705.48" dur="5.76">um that serve the purpose of helping us</text><text start="707.94" dur="5.639">talk to each other and make important</text><text start="711.24" dur="4.74">decisions together and we we don&apos;t</text><text start="713.579" dur="5.041">really have those and I think that we&apos;re</text><text start="715.98" dur="4.74">at the very uh a radical exchange what</text><text start="718.62" dur="4.8">we&apos;re doing is we&apos;re trying to</text><text start="720.72" dur="4.98">understand how is it that the this</text><text start="723.42" dur="3.78">digital public infrastructure can be</text><text start="725.7" dur="4.02">built along with many other</text><text start="727.2" dur="5.16">organizations but I think that all of us</text><text start="729.72" dur="6.6">are at the very beginning we&apos;re barely</text><text start="732.36" dur="6.44">scratching the surface of what uh what</text><text start="736.32" dur="7.699">those tools can and should look like</text><text start="738.8" dur="8.62">this is a deeply sort of neglected area</text><text start="744.019" dur="4.841">of investment there&apos;s no investment in</text><text start="747.42" dur="3.539">building out those tools and there&apos;s</text><text start="748.86" dur="4.38">also very little</text><text start="750.959" dur="4.62">um creativity and Imagination when it</text><text start="753.24" dur="5.3">comes to trying to understand how is it</text><text start="755.579" dur="7.021">that digital tools can</text><text start="758.54" dur="6.06">magnify our ability to see each other to</text><text start="762.6" dur="6.299">understand each other to</text><text start="764.6" dur="8.08">find compromises to build Bridges

of</text><text start="778.16" dur="4.72">auditing uh said it wonderfully once she</text><text start="781.32" dur="2.519">said that</text><text start="782.88" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="783.839" dur="4.921">social media is great but you don&apos;t want</text><text start="785.76" dur="6.72">to have uh social medias kind of like a</text><text start="788.76" dur="5.699">club where there are many uh bad</text><text start="792.48" dur="5.22">incentives and things that you can get</text><text start="794.459" dur="4.921">addicted to and then clubs are fine and</text><text start="797.7" dur="4.68">social media is fine but you don&apos;t want</text><text start="799.38" dur="5.22">to be voting for a president inside of a</text><text start="802.38" dur="3.78">club that&apos;s not uh or or having</text><text start="804.6" dur="4.08">discussions about the future of the</text><text start="806.16" dur="4.979">nation instead of a club we need better</text><text start="808.68" dur="4.5">environments for these things to take</text><text start="811.139" dur="4.2">place and better mechanisms and all of</text><text start="813.18" dur="4.08">that so we need to improve our social</text><text start="815.339" dur="3.901">Technologies and we need digital public</text><text start="817.26" dur="4.56">infrastructure for that</text><text start="819.24" dur="4.44">um perfect segue into the web 3 portion</text><text start="821.82" dur="4.199">of the conversation</text><text start="823.68" dur="4.32">um so who watches the Watchmen is a</text><text start="826.019" dur="3.541">paper that you wrote along with a couple</text><text start="828.0" dur="3.899">co-authors</text><text start="829.56" dur="3.839">and uh basically it&apos;s a review of</text><text start="831.899" dur="3.361">subjective approaches for civil</text><text start="833.399" dur="4.38">resistance in proof-of-personhood</text><text start="835.26" dur="4.86">protocols and I want to introduce this</text><text start="837.779" dur="3.841">paper to this audience</text><text start="840.12" dur="3.719">um I mean it&apos;s a special introduction</text><text start="841.62" dur="4.5">for me because as I was telling you in</text><text start="843.839" dur="3.361">the pre-recording Bitcoin depends on</text><text start="846.12" dur="2.58">bitcoin grants which depends on</text><text start="847.2" dur="4.02">quadratic funding which depends on civil</text><text start="848.7" dur="4.98">resistance and around like round six I</text><text start="851.22" dur="5.04">was in like a dark dark hole of like the</text><text start="853.68" dur="6.3">bear market and there&apos;s a ton of civil</text><text start="856.26" dur="6.42">attacks on bitcoin and in this paper was</text><text start="859.98" dur="4.26">just like a light it was like huh it was</text><text start="862.68" dur="3.06">just like a light light from the heavens</text><text start="864.24" dur="3.0">it&apos;s like someone else understands my</text><text start="865.74" dur="3.42">problem and is showing me how to solve</text><text start="867.24" dur="4.56">it and so the early trust bonus system</text><text start="869.16" dur="4.38">on bitcoin is informed by this paper</text><text start="871.8" dur="3.3">um so in introducing this paper I just</text><text start="873.54" dur="4.2">want to hold it in high regard and say</text><text start="875.1" dur="4.14">how much it impacted me but um yeah so</text><text start="877.74" dur="2.64">who watches the Watchmen proof of</text><text start="879.24" dur="3.06">personhood how did you come to think</text><text start="880.38" dur="4.56">about this problem what was the goal</text><text start="882.3" dur="5.099">with the paper uh would love to know how</text><text start="884.94" dur="4.56">it came to be uh thank you for sharing</text><text start="887.399" dur="3.841">that Kevin it&apos;s really really nice to to</text><text start="889.5" dur="3.24">this into this</text><text start="891.24" dur="4.56">um</text><text start="892.74" dur="5.159">and yeah I as I was saying I came into</text><text start="895.8" dur="3.899">this space into crypto because I was</text><text start="897.899" dur="4.021">thinking about how blockchain networks</text><text start="899.699" dur="4.5">could be used as an infrastructure for</text><text start="901.92" dur="4.44">self-organizing</text><text start="904.199" dur="5.58">um emerging democracies</text><text start="906.36" dur="5.46">and I think that&apos;s very much sort of in</text><text start="909.779" dur="4.62">the mythology of blockchain networks but</text><text start="911.82" dur="4.44">I wasn&apos;t seeing that very concretely in</text><text start="914.399" dur="4.8">the space and right as I started</text><text start="916.26" dur="3.66">learning about blockchains I</text><text start="919.199" dur="3.121">um</text><text start="919.92" dur="3.96">in investigating this question I came up</text><text start="922.32" dur="4.74">on this paper called the Civil attack</text><text start="923.88" dur="5.28">which essentially talks about how for</text><text start="927.06" dur="4.26">any decentralized network where you</text><text start="929.16" dur="3.96">don&apos;t have a central entity authorizing</text><text start="931.32" dur="3.48">people to join it or not</text><text start="933.12" dur="3.959">uh this network is going to be</text><text start="934.8" dur="5.339">vulnerable to a civil attack which is</text><text start="937.079" dur="5.601">essentially people uh creating hundreds</text><text start="940.139" dur="6.481">of fake ideas to join it and then</text><text start="942.68" dur="8.44">control more than 51 of the network and</text><text start="946.62" dur="5.04">taking it over uh by majority so</text><text start="951.12" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="951.66" dur="4.859">proof of four can proof of stake are</text><text start="954.12" dur="5.76">civil resistance mechanisms they are</text><text start="956.519" dur="5.161">ways to uh sort of Route Around The</text><text start="959.88" dur="3.84">Challenge because what they do is they</text><text start="961.68" dur="4.8">make it so that you can only join</text><text start="963.72" dur="5.4">blockchain networks uh through in</text><text start="966.48" dur="4.74">through scarce resources so in the case</text><text start="969.12" dur="3.48">of proof of work that&apos;s uh computing</text><text start="971.22" dur="3.84">power in the case of proof of stake</text><text start="972.6" dur="5.94">that&apos;s uh Financial power</text><text start="975.06" dur="6.66">and then that makes it so that a 51</text><text start="978.54" dur="4.5">attack would be very very expensive to</text><text start="981.72" dur="2.94">execute</text><text start="983.04" dur="3.599">so</text><text start="984.66" dur="4.5">um</text><text start="986.639" dur="4.681">the implication for governance is that</text><text start="989.16" dur="4.44">what you have mostly on ethereum is</text><text start="991.32" dur="4.92">plutocratic governance and when you want</text><text start="993.6" dur="7.26">to do Democratic governance that becomes</text><text start="996.24" dur="7.5">very very challenging uh as you know so</text><text start="1000.86" dur="5.159">um I I just started to</text><text start="1003.74" dur="7.14">um understand that if you wanted to have</text><text start="1006.019" dur="8.401">a a network that is both democratic and</text><text start="1010.88" dur="7.62">decentralized uh that you needed to come</text><text start="1014.42" dur="7.68">up with a different way of doing</text><text start="1018.5" dur="5.579">membership because otherwise if a</text><text start="1022.1" dur="4.44">network is is decentralized and</text><text start="1024.079" dur="6.12">permissionless then</text><text start="1026.54" dur="7.32">um then people you have to devise a way</text><text start="1030.199" dur="6.841">to to prevent civil attacks and then if</text><text start="1033.86" dur="5.16">that way is by anchoring membership on</text><text start="1037.04" dur="3.779">scars resources then the more scarce</text><text start="1039.02" dur="4.62">resources you have the more you&apos;re going</text><text start="1040.819" dur="5.221">to be able to accumulate them so</text><text start="1043.64" dur="4.5">um you will end up having power uh</text><text start="1046.04" dur="3.54">becoming very concentrated in this</text><text start="1048.14" dur="3.48">network which is what we&apos;re seeing today</text><text start="1049.58" dur="5.52">so there is this</text><text start="1051.62" dur="4.88">um sort of challenge in in how is it</text><text start="1055.1" dur="3.78">that you can do a</text><text start="1056.5" dur="5.02">decentralized in in Democratic Network</text><text start="1058.88" dur="4.2">it feels familiar to me um I don&apos;t know</text><text start="1061.52" dur="3.18">if you&apos;re familiar with Zuko&apos;s triangle</text><text start="1063.08" dur="4.26">but this idea that decentralization</text><text start="1064.7" dur="5.28">scalability insecurity in blockchain</text><text start="1067.34" dur="4.62">networks you pick two out of three and</text><text start="1069.98" dur="4.5">the holy two thing is that is sharding</text><text start="1071.96" dur="4.2">the network so that you can get a happy</text><text start="1074.48" dur="2.939">medium you just have multiple blockchain</text><text start="1076.16" dur="3.18">networks and that&apos;s how you scale you</text><text start="1077.419" dur="3.301">scale outwards instead of up and it</text><text start="1079.34" dur="4.02">almost feels like is there a civil</text><text start="1080.72" dur="5.339">resistance triangle where decentralized</text><text start="1083.36" dur="5.76">Democratic insecure are the axes and you</text><text start="1086.059" dur="4.381">can only pick two two of three uh it</text><text start="1089.12" dur="2.939">just feels like there&apos;s a symmetry there</text><text start="1090.44" dur="3.599">in decentralization just makes the</text><text start="1092.059" dur="4.441">problem that much harder but it&apos;s also</text><text start="1094.039" dur="3.421">very important of course</text><text start="1096.5" dur="3.059">foreign</text><text start="1097.46" dur="4.14">yeah I think that one of the ways to</text><text start="1099.559" dur="4.081">think about it that I&apos;ve come to think</text><text start="1101.6" dur="5.699">about it is that debris of difficulty</text><text start="1103.64" dur="7.26">there is to to have something that is uh</text><text start="1107.299" dur="4.681">decentralized Democratic and</text><text start="1110.9" dur="4.2">um</text><text start="1111.98" dur="5.04">and sort of universal scalable because</text><text start="1115.1" dur="4.319">it&apos;s it&apos;s very hard to have sort of one</text><text start="1117.02" dur="3.96">protocol for so it&apos;s similar to the</text><text start="1119.419" dur="4.201">sharding thinking so it&apos;s very hard to</text><text start="1120.98" dur="4.92">have one protocol uh that will serve</text><text start="1123.62" dur="4.46">everyone but you can have sort of</text><text start="1125.9" dur="4.56">multiple little</text><text start="1128.08" dur="4.18">decentralized democracies that are</text><text start="1130.46" dur="3.78">devising different ways to authenticate</text><text start="1132.26" dur="4.98">people and let them join their networks</text><text start="1134.24" dur="6.48">and that can be sort of more</text><text start="1137.24" dur="5.46">sort of replicable and you can have many</text><text start="1140.72" dur="4.56">of those I I I&apos;ve come to think about</text><text start="1142.7" dur="5.64">this as sort of the a better</text><text start="1145.28" dur="4.019">sort of more realistic path</text><text start="1148.34" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="1149.299" dur="3.541">but yeah just getting back to</text><text start="1151.22" dur="3.24">I was gonna say what were the three axes</text><text start="1152.84" dur="3.66">again decentralized Universal and what</text><text start="1154.46" dur="3.599">was the third one</text><text start="1156.5" dur="3.66">um democratic</text><text start="1158.059" dur="2.721">Democratic okay</text><text start="1160.16" dur="4.56">um</text><text start="1160.78" dur="9.519">I was going to say not sort of not</text><text start="1164.72" dur="7.74">not uh scarce resource based so proof of</text><text start="1170.299" dur="4.861">personhood based I guess</text><text start="1172.46" dur="4.92">right yeah so I mean</text><text start="1175.16" dur="3.66">it just feels very foundational to me I</text><text start="1177.38" dur="2.58">mean Zuko&apos;s triangle is foundational in</text><text start="1178.82" dur="2.4">blockchain networks this feels like a</text><text start="1179.96" dur="3.3">foundational thing in the identity space</text><text start="1181.22" dur="3.3">so I just wanted to camp on it for a sec</text><text start="1183.26" dur="3.48">but</text><text start="1184.52" dur="4.2">um but you were telling us about how you</text><text start="1186.74" dur="3.72">got into this into this problem in in</text><text start="1188.72" dur="3.24">the writing of who watches the Watchmen</text><text start="1190.46" dur="2.579">so I would love to continue pulling that</text><text start="1191.96" dur="4.26">thread</text><text start="1193.039" dur="5.041">yeah uh and I&apos;m happy to uh continue</text><text start="1196.22" dur="3.959">brainstorming what would be sort of the</text><text start="1198.08" dur="3.12">the triangle there</text><text start="1200.179" dur="4.441">um</text><text start="1201.2" dur="6.12">but yeah so so I was as I was thinking</text><text start="1204.62" dur="5.1">about how is it that uh that we could</text><text start="1207.32" dur="5.46">have Democratic Taos on the blockchain</text><text start="1209.72" dur="4.98">which seemed like an extraordinary thing</text><text start="1212.78" dur="4.86">to think about because if you have that</text><text start="1214.7" dur="5.219">then you can also have a Ubi or sort of</text><text start="1217.64" dur="5.34">currency that you sort of create and is</text><text start="1219.919" dur="6.0">shared by this community so it&apos;s it sort</text><text start="1222.98" dur="5.22">of like gives you if you can do this if</text><text start="1225.919" dur="4.981">you can have civil resistance in a</text><text start="1228.2" dur="5.28">decentralized network you can create so</text><text start="1230.9" dur="3.24">many interesting things</text><text start="1233.48" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="1234.14" dur="5.46">so I decided it was interesting enough</text><text start="1236.72" dur="5.22">to sort of be focused on on this uh</text><text start="1239.6" dur="6.48">problem try to learn a lot about it and</text><text start="1241.94" dur="6.54">I started writing out like designs for</text><text start="1246.08" dur="6.78">how to approach this and this was in</text><text start="1248.48" dur="5.1">2017. and later on</text><text start="1252.86" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="1253.58" dur="5.219">in 2018 there were a few projects that</text><text start="1256.7" dur="4.62">had come up who are doing this I</text><text start="1258.799" dur="5.701">remember bright ID and Idina came around</text><text start="1261.32" dur="6.18">that and in 2019 I saw more projects and</text><text start="1264.5" dur="5.46">then more projects and by the time that</text><text start="1267.5" dur="5.58">I that so when when I started writing</text><text start="1269.96" dur="5.04">the article it was in 2020 and it was</text><text start="1273.08" dur="4.86">because I saw that there was an</text><text start="1275.0" dur="5.88">ecosystem already around this you know</text><text start="1277.94" dur="5.82">it was such a critical problem and</text><text start="1280.88" dur="5.52">nobody was happy with you know proof of</text><text start="1283.76" dur="4.919">stake governance and how that just</text><text start="1286.4" dur="3.96">obviously leads to plutocracies that</text><text start="1288.679" dur="4.261">people were creating solutions for this</text><text start="1290.36" dur="4.98">and I thought that it was sort of a</text><text start="1292.94" dur="4.5">legitimate community enough a small</text><text start="1295.34" dur="3.9">little ecosystem that you know you could</text><text start="1297.44" dur="4.08">write about it so the idea of the paper</text><text start="1299.24" dur="5.16">was just to</text><text start="1301.52" dur="6.84">um first to give it a name because proof</text><text start="1304.4" dur="7.08">of personhood the term was used to to</text><text start="1308.36" dur="4.559">um was how a specific methodology for</text><text start="1311.48" dur="4.62">This was</text><text start="1312.919" dur="5.341">um achieved and I wanted to take that</text><text start="1316.1" dur="4.079">term and say no proof of personhood is a</text><text start="1318.26" dur="3.539">category of approaches and there are</text><text start="1320.179" dur="4.141">multiple approaches not just this one</text><text start="1321.799" dur="4.441">and say you know this is this is a space</text><text start="1324.32" dur="3.96">it&apos;s a it&apos;s an ecosystem that is</text><text start="1326.24" dur="5.58">happening so</text><text start="1328.28" dur="5.94">um so we did that and just started to</text><text start="1331.82" dur="5.4">write about the different approaches and</text><text start="1334.22" dur="5.88">compare some of the pros and cons and I</text><text start="1337.22" dur="6.0">think that the paper sort of served to</text><text start="1340.1" dur="5.16">help create this you know this new</text><text start="1343.22" dur="4.62">category to make it so that proof of</text><text start="1345.26" dur="5.159">personhood which I think nobody has</text><text start="1347.84" dur="5.1">thought about this maybe before but</text><text start="1350.419" dur="4.5">after the paper proof of personhood was</text><text start="1352.94" dur="4.2">a thing you know whereas before it was</text><text start="1354.919" dur="6.0">used in that particular context of that</text><text start="1357.14" dur="5.399">one particular uh methodology</text><text start="1360.919" dur="4.801">um and then</text><text start="1362.539" dur="5.581">and then it also I think part of what I</text><text start="1365.72" dur="5.1">wanted to do after which we collaborated</text><text start="1368.12" dur="4.679">a bit on was that in the process of</text><text start="1370.82" dur="4.32">writing the paper I interviewed many</text><text start="1372.799" dur="4.38">different uh people who are leading</text><text start="1375.14" dur="4.56">proof of personal projects and some item</text><text start="1377.179" dur="4.441">some of them I knew before some I didn&apos;t</text><text start="1379.7" dur="5.16">but I</text><text start="1381.62" dur="5.039">um I wanted to I wanted for them to</text><text start="1384.86" dur="3.84">communicate with each other as well and</text><text start="1386.659" dur="3.661">to sort of exchange the things that they</text><text start="1388.7" dur="4.5">were learning</text><text start="1390.32" dur="6.54">um through their work and so I also</text><text start="1393.2" dur="4.38">created a little sort of working group</text><text start="1396.86" dur="3.54">um</text><text start="1397.58" dur="4.8">for proof of personal projects to just</text><text start="1400.4" dur="3.48">come together get to know each other</text><text start="1402.38" dur="3.539">yeah I&apos;ve participated in a couple of</text><text start="1403.88" dur="3.9">those sessions it&apos;s been great to uh</text><text start="1405.919" dur="3.12">feels like finding our finding your</text><text start="1407.78" dur="3.42">tribe there&apos;s other people who care</text><text start="1409.039" dur="4.321">about civil resistance and identity but</text><text start="1411.2" dur="3.599">in a decentralized democratic way and</text><text start="1413.36" dur="2.58">I&apos;ve learned a lot from that group also</text><text start="1414.799" dur="3.36">I&apos;ve probably actually sourced a couple</text><text start="1415.94" dur="4.8">podcast guests from that group so thank</text><text start="1418.159" dur="4.861">you for your work on that</text><text start="1420.74" dur="4.559">yeah and it was you know it&apos;s it&apos;s funny</text><text start="1423.02" dur="5.1">because I&apos;m I&apos;m not like particularly</text><text start="1425.299" dur="5.521">interested in identity I I think I&apos;m</text><text start="1428.12" dur="6.179">more in I&apos;m in a similar position to</text><text start="1430.82" dur="7.68">yours Kevin that I&apos;m interested in</text><text start="1434.299" dur="7.681">digital democracy I&apos;m interested in</text><text start="1438.5" dur="5.94">sort of rethinking how we can do</text><text start="1441.98" dur="4.679">gov how we can collectively govern our</text><text start="1444.44" dur="3.599">communities how we can deliberate online</text><text start="1446.659" dur="4.201">sort of these are some of the questions</text><text start="1448.039" dur="4.441">that are in my mind but I I think that</text><text start="1450.86" dur="4.08">the work on this paper came from a</text><text start="1452.48" dur="5.88">recognition that identity is really a</text><text start="1454.94" dur="6.239">crucial element for this</text><text start="1458.36" dur="3.78">um I don&apos;t think that</text><text start="1461.179" dur="3.841">um</text><text start="1462.14" dur="6.659">as I was saying I nowadays the the</text><text start="1465.02" dur="8.519">projects that I reviewed in that paper</text><text start="1468.799" dur="8.101">together with dvsc darthan uh Sergey and</text><text start="1473.539" dur="5.041">Santi the co-authors the projects that</text><text start="1476.9" dur="3.42">we reviewed were looking at sort of</text><text start="1478.58" dur="4.8">universal Solutions</text><text start="1480.32" dur="5.64">um these days I&apos;m a lot more excited to</text><text start="1483.38" dur="5.06">think about how is it that we can use so</text><text start="1485.96" dur="5.06">bound tokens or sort of more</text><text start="1488.44" dur="6.34">localized contextual</text><text start="1491.02" dur="8.139">ways of verifying each other which I I</text><text start="1494.78" dur="5.82">think will be more generative and more</text><text start="1499.159" dur="4.561">um</text><text start="1500.6" dur="5.52">interesting uh in you know to to they</text><text start="1503.72" dur="4.079">they lead to more interesting use cases</text><text start="1506.12" dur="4.08">because what I&apos;m what I&apos;m thinking about</text><text start="1507.799" dur="5.521">is how to do digital democracy on the</text><text start="1510.2" dur="4.14">blockchain uh and outside of it</text><text start="1513.32" dur="4.56">um</text><text start="1514.34" dur="6.06">and and if you have sort of more</text><text start="1517.88" dur="4.98">differentiation between groups within a</text><text start="1520.4" dur="5.34">community that allows you to do more</text><text start="1522.86" dur="4.799">interesting ways of uh

dur="6.12">um so so I&apos;m more in the I&apos;m leaning</text><text start="1534.38" dur="3.36">more towards the spt&apos;s uh path these</text><text start="1536.84" dur="3.66">days</text><text start="1537.74" dur="4.439">right yeah the SBT paper that vitalik</text><text start="1540.5" dur="4.32">and Glennon</text><text start="1542.179" dur="4.441">um and others wrote I think has been a</text><text start="1544.82" dur="3.239">huge inspiration for many of us in</text><text start="1546.62" dur="4.2">thinking about the plurality of data</text><text start="1548.059" dur="4.141">sets that could be uh available and and</text><text start="1550.82" dur="3.599">what could be done there and I think</text><text start="1552.2" dur="4.02">civil resistance data set paired with</text><text start="1554.419" dur="3.601">the membership data set so that you know</text><text start="1556.22" dur="3.3">that you&apos;re a part of a community allows</text><text start="1558.02" dur="3.899">you to do more so there&apos;s kind of like a</text><text start="1559.52" dur="4.68">money Lego aspect to it</text><text start="1561.919" dur="3.661">um what what Solutions or Trends or</text><text start="1564.2" dur="3.26">projects in the market are you excited</text><text start="1565.58" dur="3.66">about right now</text><text start="1567.46" dur="3.339">hmm</text><text start="1569.24" dur="3.66">um</text><text start="1570.799" dur="4.561">there&apos;s there&apos;s one project that I&apos;ve</text><text start="1572.9" dur="6.3">been a bit obsessed about it&apos;s uh called</text><text start="1575.36" dur="7.98">govern uh g-o-v-r-n</text><text start="1579.2" dur="6.54">uh yes and they&apos;re doing spts for Dow</text><text start="1583.34" dur="5.04">contributions and</text><text start="1585.74" dur="4.14">maybe you know it doesn&apos;t sound like a</text><text start="1588.38" dur="4.44">big deal but I actually think that this</text><text start="1589.88" dur="6.419">can become a huge thing you know it can</text><text start="1592.82" dur="4.56">help sort of structure more</text><text start="1596.299" dur="3.781">um</text><text start="1597.38" dur="5.399">sort of it can give more resolution to</text><text start="1600.08" dur="5.4">how uh people are contributing to</text><text start="1602.779" dur="4.621">different communities and and the ways</text><text start="1605.48" dur="3.36">in which you could use that information</text><text start="1607.4" dur="4.259">to</text><text start="1608.84" dur="5.219">create more interesting reward systems</text><text start="1611.659" dur="4.861">to create better governance models is</text><text start="1614.059" dur="3.841">really mind-blowing to me and I also</text><text start="1616.52" dur="5.039">think that they&apos;re just doing it really</text><text start="1617.9" dur="6.659">well the interface is extraordinary</text><text start="1621.559" dur="5.341">um and they they are sort of they were</text><text start="1624.559" dur="4.321">thinking about</text><text start="1626.9" dur="3.899">um also they were coming from a similar</text><text start="1628.88" dur="4.2">place in mind of thinking about how is</text><text start="1630.799" dur="4.161">it that they can improve democracy and</text><text start="1633.08" dur="4.44">work with uh</text><text start="1634.96" dur="4.18">Legacy institutions as they say in the</text><text start="1637.52" dur="3.259">crypto World</text><text start="1639.14" dur="6.659">um and sort of</text><text start="1640.779" dur="8.321">recognized how crypto can offer really</text><text start="1645.799" dur="7.38">interesting promising reach design space</text><text start="1649.1" dur="6.3">and jumped into it building a phenomenal</text><text start="1653.179" dur="4.62">uh product and I&apos;m super excited about</text><text start="1655.4" dur="4.56">geek coin as well I always you know when</text><text start="1657.799" dur="4.921">we&apos;re trying to explain uh what is it</text><text start="1659.96" dur="5.4">that we do at radical exchange</text><text start="1662.72" dur="5.72">um obviously I always mention uh git</text><text start="1665.36" dur="4.799">coin and it&apos;s it&apos;s sort of</text><text start="1668.44" dur="3.7">proved</text><text start="1670.159" dur="4.441">um it really is sort of the greatest</text><text start="1672.14" dur="4.8">example that we can provide of the power</text><text start="1674.6" dur="4.04">of of some of the concepts that we&apos;re</text><text start="1676.94" dur="4.38">working with and how they can serve to</text><text start="1678.64" dur="5.019">really energize</text><text start="1681.32" dur="5.04">um a community invigorate it and help</text><text start="1683.659" dur="5.64">facilitate uh participation and</text><text start="1686.36" dur="6.419">contributions in ways that other designs</text><text start="1689.299" dur="6.061">sort of don&apos;t don&apos;t so so super excited</text><text start="1692.779" dur="4.921">about it as well well thank you for</text><text start="1695.36" dur="4.199">saying that I think that get coin</text><text start="1697.7" dur="6.0">wouldn&apos;t be possible without the work of</text><text start="1699.559" dur="6.421">radical exchange and your work and uh oh</text><text start="1703.7" dur="3.719">you know Joe Lubin believed in Bitcoin</text><text start="1705.98" dur="2.819">before anyone else and so I think we&apos;re</text><text start="1707.419" dur="2.701">all standing on the shoulders of giants</text><text start="1708.799" dur="2.88">and that&apos;s one of the cool things about</text><text start="1710.12" dur="4.08">this space</text><text start="1711.679" dur="4.021">um it&apos;s been interesting since I I read</text><text start="1714.2" dur="3.18">the who watches the Watchman paper and</text><text start="1715.7" dur="4.92">as I mentioned who watches the Watchman</text><text start="1717.38" dur="5.159">was a inspiration actually the primary</text><text start="1720.62" dur="5.58">inspiration behind get coins trust bonus</text><text start="1722.539" dur="6.061">which was its V1 civil resistance tool</text><text start="1726.2" dur="6.3">um I I I gotta ask like when I look at</text><text start="1728.6" dur="5.699">the uh at the paper uh I see I see</text><text start="1732.5" dur="3.72">things like web of trust and token</text><text start="1734.299" dur="3.541">curated Registries and intersectional</text><text start="1736.22"

tools are are exciting I mean I</text><text start="1756.2" dur="2.82">think we&apos;ve talked about how your views</text><text start="1757.279" dur="5.64">have evolved since then</text><text start="1759.02" dur="7.379">yeah I I I I definitely think that the</text><text start="1762.919" dur="5.88">sobone tokens paper is the who watches</text><text start="1766.399" dur="6.061">the Watchmen chew</text><text start="1768.799" dur="5.88">um okay and the answer is perhaps yeah</text><text start="1772.46" dur="4.8">everybody watches them I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="1774.679" dur="4.74">uh if uh Puja and Glenn and vitalik</text><text start="1777.26" dur="4.139">would uh say that you know I think it</text><text start="1779.419" dur="4.201">belongs in a category of its own but at</text><text start="1781.399" dur="5.461">the same time it</text><text start="1783.62" dur="5.64">it represents uh sort of the next step</text><text start="1786.86" dur="6.419">in my thinking about</text><text start="1789.26" dur="8.58">um about what three identity</text><text start="1793.279" dur="7.081">um having said that I just love the</text><text start="1797.84" dur="4.92">proof of personhood community so much as</text><text start="1800.36" dur="4.98">you mentioned this it was just so</text><text start="1802.76" dur="4.86">special to be able to have everyone in</text><text start="1805.34" dur="4.38">the same place because you often feel</text><text start="1807.62" dur="4.38">like you&apos;re sort of swimming against the</text><text start="1809.72" dur="4.38">current when you&apos;re in this space right</text><text start="1812.0" dur="3.6">like nobody wants to talk you know</text><text start="1814.1" dur="4.199">nobody wanted to talk about identity</text><text start="1815.6" dur="4.98">before the sovan paper nobody wanted to</text><text start="1818.299" dur="4.38">talk about that it was if you said that</text><text start="1820.58" dur="3.66">they would just sort of give you the</text><text start="1822.679" dur="4.081">sibo attack paper and say you know</text><text start="1824.24" dur="5.1">that&apos;s impossible uh it&apos;s impossible to</text><text start="1826.76" dur="4.019">have sort of a proof of personhood and</text><text start="1829.34" dur="2.819">you know these things will never work</text><text start="1830.779" dur="2.4">out</text><text start="1832.159" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="1833.179" dur="4.62">and</text><text start="1835.279" dur="4.14">yeah you so it&apos;s it&apos;s sort of I think</text><text start="1837.799" dur="5.941">that for everyone in that space it was</text><text start="1839.419" dur="6.961">sort of a lonely path of like trying to</text><text start="1843.74" dur="3.299">put together something that</text><text start="1846.38" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="1847.039" dur="5.041">went against the expectations and and</text><text start="1849.38" dur="4.5">trying to do that because we all thought</text><text start="1852.08" dur="4.14">that it was really important some of the</text><text start="1853.88" dur="5.46">people working on this are in places</text><text start="1856.22" dur="4.14">like Russia and other countries that</text><text start="1859.34" dur="3.54">were</text><text start="1860.36" dur="6.179">the reason why they&apos;re doing it is</text><text start="1862.88" dur="7.2">because they actually want to create</text><text start="1866.539" dur="5.281">an escape a way to exit very</text><text start="1870.08" dur="4.92">authoritarian governments you know the</text><text start="1871.82" dur="3.92">motivations are are so</text><text start="1875.0" dur="3.779">um</text><text start="1875.74" dur="5.14">impressive to hear and sort of the</text><text start="1878.779" dur="4.801">dedication that people put into trying</text><text start="1880.88" dur="5.58">to create blockchains as</text><text start="1883.58" dur="6.24">you know what truly decentralized not</text><text start="1886.46" dur="5.699">based on uh scarce resources type of</text><text start="1889.82" dur="5.579">mechanisms and I also think it&apos;s</text><text start="1892.159" dur="5.101">fascinating maybe like one thing that</text><text start="1895.399" dur="5.821">would sort of</text><text start="1897.26" dur="6.6">uh probably married a version two is how</text><text start="1901.22" dur="5.819">new blockchains are being created on top</text><text start="1903.86" dur="5.58">of this so right ID uh created their own</text><text start="1907.039" dur="5.161">blockchain and I know that I Idina is</text><text start="1909.44" dur="5.479">its own blockchain and it&apos;s exciting to</text><text start="1912.2" dur="5.52">think about how is it that we can maybe</text><text start="1914.919" dur="3.941">could possibly one day move to a</text><text start="1917.72" dur="5.22">different</text><text start="1918.86" dur="6.419">layer one Paradigm uh I I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="1922.94" dur="4.64">that&apos;s possible I think you know there</text><text start="1925.279" dur="5.461">are some attempts but uh</text><text start="1927.58" dur="5.5">but that would be that&apos;s something that</text><text start="1930.74" dur="4.02">I&apos;m very intrigued by and that if it</text><text start="1933.08" dur="4.079">happened I think it would be sort of</text><text start="1934.76" dur="3.24">deeply revolutionary</text><text start="1937.159" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="1938.0" dur="4.2">so you&apos;re talking about a layer

dur="3.719">to speak for 10 minutes about her</text><text start="1973.399" dur="3.681">background but she&apos;s a person a</text><text start="1975.679" dur="4.021">revolutionary</text><text start="1977.08" dur="4.42">activists and</text><text start="1979.7" dur="4.92">um sort of one of my very early</text><text start="1981.5" dur="5.64">Inspirations in in all of this and she</text><text start="1984.62" dur="6.179">uh she&apos;s the digital minister of Taiwan</text><text start="1987.14" dur="7.62">and in during the pandemic they uh sort</text><text start="1990.799" dur="6.6">of the hacktivism culture in Taiwan and</text><text start="1994.76" dur="5.22">her support of that culture in through</text><text start="1997.399" dur="3.841">the digital Ministry have made it so</text><text start="1999.98" dur="2.88">that</text><text start="2001.24" dur="4.679">um</text><text start="2002.86" dur="6.36">citizens could come together and</text><text start="2005.919" dur="4.801">create very interesting solutions to</text><text start="2009.22" dur="3.78">sort of tackle the pandemic so one</text><text start="2010.72" dur="4.98">example of that which he has she has</text><text start="2013.0" dur="5.7">framed it as a human blockchain a</text><text start="2015.7" dur="4.8">blockchain of humans was that</text><text start="2018.7" dur="4.079">um at the beginning of the pandemic</text><text start="2020.5" dur="4.26">everyone was rushing to buy masks right</text><text start="2022.779" dur="6.181">and</text><text start="2024.76" dur="6.299">so someone created a map in which you</text><text start="2028.96" dur="3.839">could see all of the pharmacies all of</text><text start="2031.059" dur="4.321">the drugstores and how many masks were</text><text start="2032.799" dur="3.181">in each of them and then</text><text start="2035.38" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="2035.98" dur="5.28">everyone hundreds of thousands of people</text><text start="2038.5" dur="6.179">came to this app and could contribute to</text><text start="2041.26" dur="6.36">it with information about the quantity</text><text start="2044.679" dur="5.521">of masks in their local shops so you had</text><text start="2047.62" dur="5.94">this system that was updated every 30</text><text start="2050.2" dur="6.0">seconds with just precise information</text><text start="2053.56" dur="4.799">about the quantity of masks which sort</text><text start="2056.2" dur="4.639">of relaxed everyone and so they didn&apos;t</text><text start="2058.359" dur="5.941">hoard it and</text><text start="2060.839" dur="6.161">for a government to do this to keep this</text><text start="2064.3" dur="4.619">updated would be almost impossible even</text><text start="2067.0" dur="3.78">if it was like trying to execute it</text><text start="2068.919" dur="3.96">really well it would take some time it</text><text start="2070.78" dur="5.04">would be able to update it maybe once a</text><text start="2072.879" dur="4.621">day or once every two days</text><text start="2075.82" dur="6.12">um and it wouldn&apos;t be and because of</text><text start="2077.5" dur="6.119">that lag between sort of the the that</text><text start="2081.94" dur="4.14">lagging sort of being able to broadcast</text><text start="2083.619" dur="5.22">that precise information uh the</text><text start="2086.08" dur="4.74">information wouldn&apos;t be precise and uh</text><text start="2088.839" dur="4.5">you wouldn&apos;t generate that sense of like</text><text start="2090.82" dur="5.519">calm and that was achieved through this</text><text start="2093.339" dur="5.401">coordination and and so it&apos;s a pretty</text><text start="2096.339" dur="5.221">impressive feat of sort of collective</text><text start="2098.74" dur="5.58">organizing and in some ways it operated</text><text start="2101.56" dur="5.64">like a blockchain made of humans where</text><text start="2104.32" dur="4.86">like sharing this information</text><text start="2107.2" dur="4.86">um and verifying it and so if there was</text><text start="2109.18" dur="4.38">some uh if if the information in the</text><text start="2112.06" dur="3.42">database was wrong about one Pharmacy</text><text start="2113.56" dur="5.279">they could just</text><text start="2115.48" dur="6.48">um call a line and and</text><text start="2118.839" dur="3.841">um have it be corrected</text><text start="2121.96" dur="2.52">um</text><text start="2122.68" dur="5.12">and so I I don&apos;t know what I mean</text><text start="2124.48" dur="6.359">exactly when I talk about a sort of a</text><text start="2127.8" dur="4.96">base one layer where each person is a</text><text start="2130.839" dur="4.381">human that sort of idea in some ways but</text><text start="2132.76" dur="4.56">there are questions about uh how far</text><text start="2135.22" dur="4.379">that could scale</text><text start="2137.32" dur="5.039">um although it&apos;s you know it&apos;s an</text><text start="2139.599" dur="6.48">extraordinary project and very very very</text><text start="2142.359" dur="5.22">much worth looking into learning about I</text><text start="2146.079" dur="3.54">think it&apos;s one of the most interesting</text><text start="2147.579" dur="5.941">things happening in the blockchain space</text><text start="2149.619" dur="7.081">to I&apos;m going to describe it uh quickly</text><text start="2153.52" dur="5.099">it&apos;s you know a system in which people</text><text start="2156.7" dur="3.899">um they have meetings that are</text><text start="2158.619" dur="4.861">pre-scheduled and they all come online</text><text start="2160.599" dur="5.221">and then solve these puzzles online all</text><text start="2163.48" dur="4.98">at the same time synchronously so that</text><text start="2165.82" dur="3.96">you can&apos;t do it multiple times you have</text><text start="2168.46" dur="3.6">a specific</text><text start="2169.78" dur="4.319">um there&apos;s a limit of how much time you</text><text start="2172.06" dur="4.38">can take to solve the puzzles and then</text><text start="2174.099" dur="4.141">everyone who participated in this is a</text><text start="2176.44" dur="4.02">node in the blockchain so it&apos;s super</text><text start="2178.24" dur="4.619">fascinating</text><text start="2180.46" dur="4.46">um but yeah I think it would be</text><text start="2182.859" dur="4.021">um I I wonder about</text><text start="2184.92" dur="5.14">what are the</text><text start="2186.88" dur="6.06">digital kinds of infrastructure that we</text><text start="2190.06" dur="4.44">can create if we start to connect with</text><text start="2192.94" dur="4.26">each other as humans</text><text start="2194.5" dur="5.339">um and not you know through the through</text><text start="2197.2" dur="5.04">an infrastructure that is based on uh</text><text start="2199.839" dur="4.201">proof of work or proof of stake</text><text start="2202.24" dur="3.96">um but I think that would take a long</text><text start="2204.04" dur="4.74">time but I think that that that&apos;s what</text><text

start="2407.619" dur="3.901">markets are collective intelligence</text><text start="2409.599" dur="4.381">mechanisms democracy or collective</text><text start="2411.52" dur="4.319">intelligence

start="2425.44" dur="3.72">think they&apos;re fascinating questions uh</text><text start="2427.72" dur="3.48">to ask</text><text start="2429.16" dur="5.04">um about what is it that we can achieve</text><text start="2431.2" dur="5.399">together uh when when we have the proper</text><text start="2434.2" dur="4.919">infrastructure for it</text><text start="2436.599" dur="3.901">yeah yeah absolutely</text><text start="2439.119" dur="2.881">um and so maybe you know civil</text><text start="2440.5" dur="3.0">resistance is just sort of one of the</text><text start="2442.0" dur="4.68">problems that we&apos;re solving a first</text><text start="2443.5" dur="5.22">place that is a high leverage point for</text><text start="2446.68" dur="3.54">other collective intelligence problems</text><text start="2448.72" dur="3.899">being solved and I just want to camp on</text><text start="2450.22" dur="3.54">that for a little bit because to me you</text><text start="2452.619" dur="3.601">know we talk in the blockchain space</text><text start="2453.76" dur="4.26">about money Legos a lot and basically</text><text start="2456.22" dur="3.119">what is the uh you know erc20 the effect</text><text start="2458.02" dur="4.079">that opens Zeppelin just has an</text><text start="2459.339" dur="4.681">auditable erc20 Library means that I as</text><text start="2462.099" dur="3.961">a hacker can go just deploy an erc20</text><text start="2464.02" dur="3.839">thing as part of my project and go focus</text><text start="2466.06" dur="4.5">on my use case instead of rebuilding</text><text start="2467.859" dur="4.381">that that that Lego</text><text start="2470.56" dur="3.36">um and so</text><text start="2472.24" dur="3.42">um you know can you can you can you like</text><text start="2473.92" dur="3.419">paint me a picture of a world in which</text><text start="2475.66" dur="5.22">there&apos;s just a civil resistance money</text><text start="2477.339" dur="5.341">Lego uh if if we solve that what do we</text><text start="2480.88" dur="4.14">get like what what are the what are the</text><text start="2482.68" dur="5.06">goodies that that could be gotten if if</text><text start="2485.02" dur="2.72">that is solved</text><text start="2490.0" dur="6.42">um you know it is really</text><text start="2493.2" dur="4.3">compelling to think about uh what do we</text><text start="2496.42" dur="3.36">get</text><text start="2497.5" dur="3.38">um you know because identity is sort of</text><text start="2499.78" dur="3.48">this</text><text start="2500.88" dur="3.1">fundamental thing</text><text start="2503.26" dur="4.44">um</text><text start="2503.98" dur="6.48">it&apos;s this fundamental building block</text><text start="2507.7" dur="6.659">um of our

dur="6.841">Primavera de Philippines said that uh</text><text start="2529.119" dur="5.761">you know blockchain solved the uh double</text><text start="2532.96" dur="3.78">spend problem but we need to solve the</text><text start="2534.88" dur="3.66">double human problem and and I think</text><text start="2536.74" dur="4.2">that we can do that we&apos;re very well</text><text start="2538.54" dur="4.68">equipped to do that in especially in</text><text start="2540.94" dur="4.62">small communities through new</text><text start="2543.22" dur="3.92">interesting mechanisms like spts

start="2567.339" dur="4.681">um my colleague Matt Pruitt talks a lot</text><text start="2570.04" dur="4.68">about that he says that</text><text start="2572.02" dur="3.839">um Universal

dur="4.92">online had those tools in their hands</text><text start="2704.74" dur="4.92">it&apos;s it&apos;s mind-blowing to think about</text><text start="2706.96" dur="6.06">what would happen if um</text><text start="2709.66" dur="6.0">if the Arab Spring you know you know how</text><text start="2713.02" dur="6.059">it started on Facebook with Facebook</text><text start="2715.66" dur="3.98">tools like but what if they had</text><text start="2719.079" dur="4.441">um</text><text start="2719.64" dur="5.74">interesting sort of Dao tools uh at</text><text start="2723.52" dur="4.319">their disposal too and that would help</text><text start="2725.38" dur="5.64">them do governance and by that I don&apos;t</text><text start="2727.839" dur="5.641">mean that I I&apos;m I almost regret saying</text><text start="2731.02" dur="4.26">this because I don&apos;t think that right</text><text start="2733.48" dur="5.52">now the direction in which Taos are</text><text

dur="3.54">which is why we&apos;re having this</text><text start="2742.66" dur="3.9">conversation you know we we need to</text><text start="2744.76" dur="3.3">devise better identity mechanisms

be</text><text start="2752.319" dur="6.5">really interesting to see what different</text><text start="2754.24" dur="4.579">social movements uh do with those tools</text><text start="2760.359" dur="3.421">um</text><text start="2761.14" dur="4.439">you know it sort of like moves</text><text start="2763.78" dur="4.5">um sorry to interrupt but I think that</text><text start="2765.579" dur="5.821">the the what what he what it means is</text><text start="2768.28" dur="6.36">that you get to have the ability as a</text><text start="2771.4" dur="6.48">collective and as a society to move from</text><text start="2774.64" dur="4.32">protest and agitation towards</text><text start="2777.88" dur="2.939">Construction</text><text start="2778.96" dur="4.68">and</text><text start="2780.819" dur="4.441">that&apos;s you know revolutionary</text><text start="2783.64" dur="3.12">let&apos;s record an episode with Nathan</text><text start="2785.26" dur="3.599">Schneider and we talked a lot about how</text><text start="2786.76" dur="3.42">social media can do coherence things it</text><text start="2788.859" dur="3.48">can break things down it can create</text><text start="2790.18" dur="4.2">Revolution but it doesn&apos;t hold power all</text><text start="2792.339" dur="3.841">that well so you know your example of</text><text start="2794.38" dur="3.3">the Arab Spring and Nathan&apos;s example of</text><text start="2796.18" dur="3.3">Occupy Wall Street being these mass</text><text start="2797.68" dur="3.06">movements in which you deconstructed</text><text start="2799.48" dur="2.58">power</text><text start="2800.74" dur="2.7">um but then they kind of like piddled</text><text start="2802.06" dur="3.96">out when they were expected to hold</text><text start="2803.44" dur="5.28">power and I think that that&apos;s one of the</text><text start="2806.02" dur="4.68">upsides that I see for I mean we talk</text><text start="2808.72" dur="5.04">the meme is digital democracy and high</text><text start="2810.7" dur="4.74">resolution democracy and those are</text><text start="2813.76" dur="3.18">hopefully institutions in collective</text><text start="2815.44" dur="4.56">intelligence mechanisms that can hold</text><text start="2816.94" dur="4.74">power if they&apos;re designed well so to me</text><text start="2820.0" dur="3.48">the question is what are the money Legos</text><text start="2821.68" dur="4.38">that allow</text><text start="2823.48" dur="5.339">us to get there and how do we rotate</text><text start="2826.06" dur="4.86">capital and talent into ecosystems so</text><text start="2828.819" dur="5.401">that you know like what 2017 was to</text><text start="2830.92" dur="5.82">Capital formation and icos in 2022 was</text><text start="2834.22" dur="4.8">to nfts I guess 2021 was to nfts like</text><text start="2836.74" dur="4.8">what would it take for digital democracy</text><text start="2839.02" dur="4.319">capital and talent rotation in 2024 like</text><text start="2841.54" dur="3.24">what are the money Legos that we need to</text><text start="2843.339" dur="3.661">get there clearly there&apos;s a civil</text><text start="2844.78" dur="4.5">resistance money Lego what are the other</text><text start="2847.0" dur="4.26">high leverage points in in creating that</text><text start="2849.28" dur="3.299">that system or is that is that even the</text><text start="2851.26" dur="4.02">system we want to create and if so what</text><text start="2852.579" dur="5.941">are the high leverage points I think</text><text start="2855.28" dur="5.039">that and it sort of profoundly</text><text start="2858.52" dur="5.64">underappreciated</text><text start="2860.319" dur="4.8">Lego if you want to call it is</text><text start="2864.16" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="2865.119" dur="4.74">Community organizing</text><text start="2867.4" dur="4.62">um I think that we</text><text start="2869.859" dur="5.281">sort of one of the reasons why Bitcoin</text><text start="2872.02" dur="4.559">is so exceptional is because</text><text start="2875.14" dur="2.16">you</text><text start="2876.579" dur="3.54">um</text><text start="2877.3" dur="5.039">sort of exerted a leadership role you</text><text start="2880.119" dur="4.321">communicated a lot about these ideas you</text><text start="2882.339" dur="3.861">cared about making so that more people</text><text start="2884.44" dur="5.28">understood this is what we&apos;re doing here</text><text start="2886.2" dur="6.639">and you you built a community around it</text><text start="2889.72" dur="3.84">not just a product right</text><text start="2892.839" dur="2.101">um</text><text start="2893.56" dur="4.559">and I</text><text start="2894.94" dur="6.899">when I talk to sort of the</text><text start="2898.119" dur="5.821">the activists from Taiwan and all of the</text><text start="2901.839" dur="3.441">work and effort that they put into you</text><text start="2903.94" dur="3.419">know it&apos;s we we talk a lot about</text><text start="2905.28" dur="4.72">decentralization as this sort of</text><text start="2907.359" dur="6.181">desirable thing but actually bringing</text><text start="2910.0" dur="5.339">our community together is a process that</text><text start="2913.54" dur="3.84">takes a lot of centralization you know</text><text start="2915.339" dur="3.901">it takes a lot of sort of</text><text start="2917.38" dur="4.26">focused work</text><text start="2919.24" dur="3.379">um and you need to create spaces in</text><text start="2921.64" dur="3.959">which</text><text start="2922.619" dur="5.2">uh different actors can come into</text><text start="2925.599" dur="3.781">relationship with each other uh people</text><text start="2927.819" dur="5.04">from government people from Tech</text><text start="2929.38" dur="6.239">designers people activists</text><text start="2932.859" dur="5.701">um Scholars of all kinds</text><text start="2935.619" dur="5.881">um you need to these spaces need to be</text><text start="2938.56" dur="4.68">nice fun present you know they need to</text><text start="2941.5" dur="3.54">have nice food they need to have nice</text><text start="2943.24" dur="4.02">music they need to be sort of a positive</text><text start="2945.04" dur="2.819">experience that everyone wants to</text><text start="2947.26" dur="2.7">um</text><text start="2947.859" dur="4.381">that makes everyone wants to be there</text><text start="2949.96" dur="4.92">and sort of co-create together because</text><text start="2952.24" dur="7.619">we don&apos;t have a lot of um</text><text start="2954.88" dur="10.199">experience in sort of really living</text><text start="2959.859" dur="7.98">as a Civic life right like we don&apos;t most</text><text start="2965.079" dur="4.74">of us are sort of not doing anything</text><text start="2967.839" dur="4.861">that is concerned the collective and</text><text start="2969.819" dur="6.901">even though my work for example is sort</text><text start="2972.7" dur="5.34">of working at rxc with with uh consult</text><text start="2976.72" dur="3.96">with many people who are in government</text><text start="2978.04" dur="5.46">and helping them structure participatory</text><text start="2980.68" dur="4.5">processes in my own Community I don&apos;t</text><text start="2983.5" dur="4.68">have a lot of that lost a lot of that</text><text start="2985.18" dur="5.12">also especially due to the pandemic but</text><text start="2988.18" dur="4.2">I just think that in general</text><text start="2990.3" dur="4.299">there is</text><text start="2992.38" dur="4.5">um a role that for Community</text><text start="2994.599" dur="3.961">entrepreneurship sort of bringing</text><text start="2996.88" dur="5.699">different people together</text><text start="2998.56" dur="6.12">and um and creating the culture creating</text><text start="3002.579" dur="4.081">the space creating the opportunities for</text><text start="3004.68" dur="4.98">collaboration</text><text start="3006.66" dur="4.56">um that is seriously underestimated like</text><text start="3009.66" dur="4.14">this is a crucial</text><text start="3011.22" dur="6.24">part of how to build these things and</text><text start="3013.8" dur="6.48">nobody talks about that uh whereas I I</text><text start="3017.46" dur="4.32">think that is exactly why because it&apos;s</text><text start="3020.28" dur="4.14">sort of a baffling thing I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="3021.78" dur="5.88">you ever think about this Kevin but in</text><text start="3024.42" dur="6.419">between 2017 and 27 in 2018 so much</text><text start="3027.66" dur="6.9">money was poured into these Dao projects</text><text start="3030.839" dur="5.76">right like in the Ico boom like why is</text><text start="3034.56" dur="4.259">it that we&apos;re not getting sort of</text><text start="3036.599" dur="4.681">astounding results out of it you know</text><text start="3038.819" dur="5.941">why didn&apos;t they build out all of these</text><text start="3041.28" dur="5.16">nice Civic civil resistance stuff and</text><text start="3044.76" dur="5.9">interest in governance stuff because</text><text start="3046.44" dur="9.119">they didn&apos;t had good leadership you know</text><text start="3050.66" dur="8.38">and that so so that&apos;s I think a Lego</text><text start="3055.559" dur="5.401">that we need a lot more of and and then</text><text start="3059.04" dur="5.64">which leads to the question of like how</text><text start="3060.96" dur="4.92">how do you build these uh these leaders</text><text start="3064.68" dur="3.12">yeah</text><text start="3065.88" dur="4.8">yeah well you know thank you for the</text><text start="3067.8" dur="4.319">nice things you said about Bitcoin uh of</text><text start="3070.68" dur="2.939">course equally nice things to say about</text><text start="3072.119" dur="4.321">your work and the leadership of radical</text><text start="3073.619" dur="5.341">exchange has been immense</text><text start="3076.44" dur="4.8">um and there&apos;s many many leaders in the</text><text start="3078.96" dur="3.96">ecosystem that I think are creating a</text><text start="3081.24" dur="4.02">plurality that hopefully creates that</text><text start="3082.92" dur="5.399">rotation of capital and talent into</text><text start="3085.26" dur="4.079">creating these Legos in the next cycle</text><text start="3088.319" dur="2.581">um and I guess you know that&apos;s a segue</text><text start="3089.339" dur="4.081">to Max question is what are you up to</text><text start="3090.9" dur="4.98">now uh your CEO at radical exchange what</text><text start="3093.42" dur="4.86">are you focused on uh are you creating</text><text start="3095.88" dur="4.679">leadership in order to create a movement</text><text start="3098.28" dur="4.88">towards this stuff and uh how can people</text><text start="3100.559" dur="2.601">help with that</text><text start="3104.099" dur="5.821">um yeah I think that ultimately a</text><text start="3107.88" dur="4.38">radical exchange but I would hope to see</text><text start="3109.92" dur="5.22">sort of the emergence of uh well</text><text start="3112.26" dur="6.78">coordinated movement</text><text start="3115.14" dur="6.0">um and it&apos;s very hard to to structure it</text><text start="3119.04" dur="4.559">um we do have chapters all over the</text><text start="3121.14" dur="4.919">world uh but we need to sort of nurture</text><text start="3123.599" dur="6.181">that uh more</text><text start="3126.059" dur="6.0">um intently and I think one one of the</text><text start="3129.78" dur="4.62">reasons why this is not sort of my focus</text><text start="3132.059" dur="5.28">right now is that I think there&apos;s an</text><text start="3134.4" dur="4.74">educational component that should come</text><text start="3137.339" dur="4.561">before that so I&apos;ve been thinking a lot</text><text start="3139.14" dur="5.219">about how to build this and we&apos;ve talked</text><text start="3141.9" dur="3.959">about this uh last week when when we saw</text><text start="3144.359" dur="3.901">each other</text><text start="3145.859" dur="5.541">um I think that there&apos;s sort of a a need</text><text start="3148.26" dur="6.54">to to create more</text><text start="3151.4" dur="6.52">accessible exciting compelling</text><text start="3154.8" dur="6.0">educational resources</text><text start="3157.92" dur="4.88">about these topics</text><text start="3160.8" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="3162.839" dur="5.581">I think you know I I ask myself a lot</text><text start="3165.9" dur="4.919">like why is it that new</text><text start="3168.42" dur="4.679">graduate you know newly graduated</text><text start="3170.819" dur="5.941">students are not sort of jumping into</text><text start="3173.099" dur="5.941">the opportunity to work in these uh with</text><text start="3176.76" dur="4.02">these questions one of their answers is</text><text start="3179.04" dur="3.539">that there aren&apos;t many opportunities you</text><text start="3180.78" dur="3.66">sort of have to create them yourself you</text><text start="3182.579" dur="4.561">know when when I started in the space</text><text start="3184.44" dur="6.119">radical exchange didn&apos;t exist</text><text start="3187.14" dur="5.76">um but yeah we do many things at rxc one</text><text start="3190.559" dur="5.28">is we put together events in the next</text><text start="3192.9" dur="4.199">two uh weeks is this going up in the</text><text start="3195.839" dur="3.48">next few weeks</text><text start="3197.099" dur="3.901">uh I will Air it on Tuesday so
