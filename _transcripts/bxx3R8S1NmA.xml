you spending</text><text start="252.0" dur="4.639">your time and energy these days yeah i</text><text start="254.56" dur="3.76">think you know all of this all over the</text><text start="256.639" dur="3.12">place but i think in the last couple</text><text start="258.32" dur="4.08">months been really</text><text start="259.759" dur="5.761">uh digging into um</text><text start="262.4" dur="4.72">crypto games play to own and</text><text start="265.52" dur="3.2">just realized that you know this is a</text><text start="267.12" dur="2.32">mental model that almost can be applied</text><text start="268.72" dur="2.72">to</text><text start="269.44" dur="3.68">you know an ownership model right that</text><text start="271.44" dur="3.039">can be applied to really</text><text start="273.12" dur="2.72">many different things other than just</text><text start="274.479" dur="3.041">games and</text><text start="275.84" dur="3.44">um yeah i&apos;ve been really really excited</text><text start="277.52" dur="3.76">about that because it sort of</text><text start="279.28" dur="3.12">provided almost this new like framework</text><text start="281.28" dur="3.28">to think about</text><text start="282.4" dur="4.079">you know uh building like the the dowser</text><text start="284.56" dur="4.4">building and the networks with what sort</text><text start="286.479" dur="3.521">of building um yeah so i&apos;m very excited</text><text start="288.96" dur="3.36">about that</text><text start="290.0" dur="4.08">yeah so say more um as i understand that</text><text start="292.32" dur="2.8">play to earn is the type of games where</text><text start="294.08" dur="2.48">you</text><text start="295.12" dur="3.519">show up you do some sort of in-game</text><text start="296.56" dur="4.479">mechanic and you earn a tokenized reward</text><text start="298.639" dur="4.0">as you advance through the game is that</text><text start="301.039" dur="3.521">more or less it</text><text start="302.639" dur="3.601">so that&apos;s a general common you know</text><text start="304.56" dur="3.359">understanding of uh play-to-own and</text><text start="306.24" dur="5.04">crypto games but you know i sort of</text><text start="307.919" dur="5.041">think of it as you know it&apos;s in in most</text><text start="311.28" dur="3.28">you know economic systems at least in</text><text start="312.96" dur="3.12">the legacy systems there&apos;s always this</text><text start="314.56" dur="3.12">middleman right right that really like</text><text start="316.08" dur="3.76">you know coordinates everything and they</text><text start="317.68" dur="3.76">take a heavy cut and due to the la you</text><text start="319.84" dur="3.359">know the inability for the market to</text><text start="321.44" dur="3.28">actually coordinate effectively they</text><text start="323.199" dur="4.481">sort of like stay in power right you</text><text start="324.72" dur="5.039">know uh in gaming these these entities</text><text start="327.68" dur="4.239">all these middlemen were you know would</text><text start="329.759" dur="4.561">traditionally be uh games publishers or</text><text start="331.919" dur="3.84">games studios right that would not only</text><text start="334.32" dur="3.2">you know coordinate the development of</text><text start="335.759" dur="3.121">games but they would you know release it</text><text start="337.52" dur="3.36">market it distribute it and then you</text><text start="338.88" dur="3.68">know monetize it right and i think you</text><text start="340.88" dur="3.12">know um there&apos;s just these massive</text><text start="342.56" dur="3.12">coordination failures where like you</text><text start="344.0" dur="3.6">know these publishers are just like</text><text start="345.68" dur="3.92">because they have total control over the</text><text start="347.6" dur="2.879">full um you know production cycle of</text><text start="349.6" dur="2.879">games</text><text start="350.479" dur="3.361">uh you know and you know they basically</text><text start="352.479" dur="3.201">can do whatever the [ __ ] they want right</text><text start="353.84" dur="4.56">including you know pushing really you</text><text start="355.68" dur="4.079">know extractive and uh vampirical sort</text><text start="358.4" dur="3.44">of like about extraction and</text><text start="359.759" dur="4.081">monetization models right onto</text><text start="361.84" dur="4.639">these economies effectively that players</text><text start="363.84" dur="4.24">belong to and bring value to while</text><text start="366.479" dur="3.521">having you know while the players almost</text><text start="368.08" dur="4.64">have no absolutely have no you know</text><text start="370.0" dur="4.479">governance uh rights no input uh you</text><text start="372.72" dur="3.84">know despite being actually being the</text><text start="374.479" dur="3.681">actual you know uh ones that bring value</text><text start="376.56" dur="4.079">to them right so um</text><text start="378.16" dur="4.24">i think you know for me like crypto um</text><text start="380.639" dur="3.761">games and you know play to earn is</text><text start="382.4" dur="3.84">actually about you know building</text><text start="384.4" dur="4.079">like i guess decentralized economies</text><text start="386.24" dur="4.32">where you know the full value cycle and</text><text start="388.479" dur="4.0">production cycle of the game</text><text start="390.56" dur="4.079">of these games right and these gaming</text><text start="392.479" dur="5.041">ecosystems that you know sort of</text><text start="394.639" dur="5.521">uh unchain and transparent and and you</text><text start="397.52" dur="4.64">know decentralize right and um</text><text start="400.16" dur="4.879">so i think it&apos;s more about you know</text><text start="402.16" dur="5.84">the governance and you know of of how</text><text start="405.039" dur="5.361">games are built and maintained and run</text><text start="408.0" dur="5.039">and and how the economies are managed</text><text start="410.4" dur="5.28">and you know uh more so than than you</text><text start="413.039" dur="3.521">know being able to earn from games right</text><text start="415.68" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="416.56" dur="3.919">i see so</text><text start="418.56" dur="4.56">so it sounds like it&apos;s it&apos;s more about</text><text start="420.479" dur="4.401">plato or i guess like play to earn is</text><text start="423.12" dur="4.479">just kind of scratching the surface and</text><text start="424.88" dur="4.96">then over time the full value cycle</text><text start="427.599" dur="3.921">uh is such that these games are released</text><text start="429.84" dur="3.12">and as players proliferate their</text><text start="431.52" dur="4.0">economies</text><text start="432.96" dur="3.92">the governance of the game kind of is</text><text start="435.52" dur="3.36">gradually transferred over to the</text><text start="436.88" dur="4.4">community from the core team</text><text start="438.88" dur="3.439">uh is that a more accurate synopsis of</text><text start="441.28" dur="3.28">what you said</text><text start="442.319" dur="3.6">definitely and i think you know the</text><text start="444.56" dur="2.479">current you know when when plays you</text><text start="445.919" dur="2.56">know let&apos;s say</text><text start="447.039" dur="2.961">like a crypto game like axe infinity</text><text start="448.479" dur="3.681">when plays you know play the game and</text><text start="450.0" dur="4.639">they earn say that&apos;s all you know like</text><text start="452.16" dur="3.52">slp tokens you know uh like it&apos;s</text><text start="454.639" dur="2.4">basically</text><text start="455.68" dur="2.959">you know these tokens like represent</text><text start="457.039" dur="3.201">ownership of this economy that allows</text><text start="458.639" dur="3.68">you know and these circuits also allow</text><text start="460.24" dur="4.72">them to breed more axes right like these</text><text start="462.319" dur="4.641">circums i i would say uh you know all</text><text start="464.96" dur="3.519">the distribution of these tokens</text><text start="466.96" dur="3.04">more or less represents like the</text><text start="468.479" dur="3.761">distribution mechanism in which</text><text start="470.0" dur="4.16">ownership is like transferred over to</text><text start="472.24" dur="3.76">the player and the economy right so you</text><text start="474.16" dur="3.92">can do this for many ways but</text><text start="476.0" dur="4.24">um yeah this is actually been sort of</text><text start="478.08" dur="4.08">the one landmark or platon project</text><text start="480.24" dur="2.639">that&apos;s really emerged right and yeah</text><text start="482.16" dur="2.879">yeah</text><text start="482.879" dur="4.561">yeah i think that you know like defy</text><text start="485.039" dur="4.56">summer had all of these like yam forks</text><text start="487.44" dur="3.84">and everyone was doing vegetable coins</text><text start="489.599" dur="3.521">and then we had like nfts and everyone</text><text start="491.28" dur="4.08">was copying loot and it seems like</text><text start="493.12" dur="4.88">within play to earn axia is kind of the</text><text start="495.36" dur="4.399">undisputed king or queen of of play to</text><text start="498.0" dur="3.12">earn and maybe people aren&apos;t aren&apos;t</text><text start="499.759" dur="3.12">forking it and copying it but it&apos;s</text><text start="501.12" dur="3.68">certainly inspiring a lot of interesting</text><text start="502.879" dur="3.121">conversations i maybe heard somewhere</text><text start="504.8" dur="3.44">that there are there are people in the</text><text start="506.0" dur="3.919">philippines that just live their lives</text><text start="508.24" dur="3.2">and make money by</text><text start="509.919" dur="2.881">playing axe infinity which i thought was</text><text start="511.44" dur="3.68">incredible</text><text start="512.8" dur="4.239">that&apos;s right um oftentimes you know um</text><text start="515.12" dur="4.24">they play the game they aim tokens uh</text><text start="517.039" dur="4.8">and then they lift up that revenue right</text><text start="519.36" dur="4.88">that they produce and that&apos;s a quite a</text><text start="521.839" dur="4.241">controversial topic around you know uh</text><text start="524.24" dur="3.039">you know in general because you know</text><text start="526.08" dur="2.56">actually like</text><text start="527.279" dur="2.721">there&apos;s this question like what you know</text><text start="528.64" dur="2.72">when you&apos;re building this in-game</text><text start="530.0" dur="2.88">economy you know</text><text start="531.36" dur="3.52">there&apos;s a question of like what is you</text><text start="532.88" dur="4.079">know what are the goals of this economy</text><text start="534.88" dur="4.88">right you know and you know it may have</text><text start="536.959" dur="4.721">many and i would say that um</text><text start="539.76" dur="3.68">there&apos;s a sort of question of like</text><text start="541.68" dur="4.24">what uh what are like valuable</text><text start="543.44" dur="4.48">contributions or valuable activities</text><text start="545.92" dur="3.359">uh of this economy and then you know</text><text start="547.92" dur="3.76">arguably</text><text start="549.279" dur="3.601">you know playing the game uh in a</text><text start="551.68" dur="4.719">playing the game and just like you know</text><text start="552.88" dur="5.44">sort of in a very low skilled you know</text><text start="556.399" dur="3.681">i guess like having like low skill plays</text><text start="558.32" dur="3.6">just playing the game owning tokens and</text><text start="560.08" dur="4.0">bombing almost like farming and dumping</text><text start="561.92" dur="3.76">without actually contributing any sort</text><text start="564.08" dur="2.96">of value to the overarching community it</text><text start="565.68" dur="2.48">would not be considered you know a</text><text start="567.04" dur="2.479">valuable</text><text start="568.16" dur="2.799">you know sort of like</text><text start="569.519" dur="2.961">a weight</text><text start="570.959" dur="2.961">would not be considered like you know a</text><text start="572.48" dur="2.72">valuable contribution right to the</text><text start="573.92" dur="3.12">economy and</text><text start="575.2" dur="3.36">and regardless of this this is sort of</text><text start="577.04" dur="3.12">what&apos;s being sort of rewarded right now</text><text start="578.56" dur="3.68">and how the set of structures have built</text><text start="580.16" dur="2.799">up and you know actually sort of used</text><text start="582.24" dur="2.64">the</text><text start="582.959" dur="2.961">sort of like initial way to just reach</text><text start="584.88" dur="2.72">tokens</text><text start="585.92" dur="3.76">as a means of you know maybe growing the</text><text start="587.6" dur="3.359">economy but how they you know district</text><text start="589.68" dur="2.24">tokens may</text><text start="590.959" dur="2.641">will</text><text start="591.92" dur="3.68">actually dramatically change over time</text><text start="593.6" dur="3.919">you know as it shifts towards retaining</text><text start="595.6" dur="3.44">uh you know and rewarding more valuable</text><text start="597.519" dur="2.401">contributions</text><text start="599.04" dur="2.239">right</text><text start="599.92" dur="3.039">yeah it&apos;s really interesting to think</text><text start="601.279" dur="3.281">about this design space of designing</text><text start="602.959" dur="3.44">around the goals of an economy and</text><text start="604.56" dur="4.24">rewarding the most valuable activities</text><text start="606.399" dur="5.921">and contributions in an economy where my</text><text start="608.8" dur="6.24">mind uh immediately grows goes is like</text><text start="612.32" dur="6.24">um you know the difference between value</text><text start="615.04" dur="5.12">created and in value captured um and</text><text start="618.56" dur="3.839">basically if you have too many people</text><text start="620.16" dur="3.84">focused on value capture and in like</text><text start="622.399" dur="3.041">business model stuff then you don&apos;t get</text><text start="624.0" dur="2.959">the public good you don&apos;t get the value</text><text start="625.44" dur="3.92">creation without the expectation of</text><text start="626.959" dur="4.641">returns and the more you can tie the</text><text start="629.36" dur="3.919">value capture to the value creation then</text><text start="631.6" dur="3.6">like the more there&apos;s aligned incentives</text><text start="633.279" dur="3.841">of the participants but like i&apos;m a</text><text start="635.2" dur="3.6">software engineer and the code that i</text><text start="637.12" dur="2.8">wrote this morning i don&apos;t even know if</text><text start="638.8" dur="3.279">it&apos;s going to make it to production and</text><text start="639.92" dur="3.76">if it is in production is it valuable</text><text start="642.079" dur="3.281">and if it is valuable then how do we</text><text start="643.68" dur="4.32">measure that and i think that there&apos;s a</text><text start="645.36" dur="5.28">big problem where when you&apos;ve got</text><text start="648.0" dur="6.32">um when you&apos;ve got work that you can&apos;t</text><text start="650.64" dur="5.04">prove was valuable um and and so that&apos;s</text><text start="654.32" dur="4.079">one of the sort of designs that i&apos;m</text><text start="655.68" dur="3.92">trying to figure out as we as you know</text><text start="658.399" dur="4.241">as someone who&apos;s been thinking a lot</text><text start="659.6" dur="4.4">about funding public goods um is is like</text><text start="662.64" dur="3.6">how do you align the value creation to</text><text start="664.0" dur="3.76">the value captured and um and i&apos;m</text><text start="666.24" dur="3.12">wondering if you know what are the most</text><text start="667.76" dur="4.24">what are the most innovative ways of</text><text start="669.36" dur="5.2">measuring measuring value and rewarding</text><text start="672.0" dur="5.44">value uh that you&apos;ve that you&apos;ve you&apos;ve</text><text start="674.56" dur="5.44">seen within the play to earn space</text><text start="677.44" dur="4.639">i think that uh we get to really see uh</text><text start="680.0" dur="4.079">you know iterations emerge which they</text><text start="682.079" dur="4.401">also happening right now um</text><text start="684.079" dur="5.521">i would say that you know</text><text start="686.48" dur="4.72">i think the current innovation like</text><text start="689.6" dur="3.76">i i think the current innovation that&apos;s</text><text start="691.2" dur="4.4">sort of emerging is just like this uh</text><text start="693.36" dur="4.159">focus towards you know uh</text><text start="695.6" dur="4.56">building like i guess focus towards like</text><text start="697.519" dur="4.721">you know i would say um</text><text start="700.16" dur="3.04">i get or focus or discussion around like</text><text start="702.24" dur="2.64">you know</text><text start="703.2" dur="3.6">what are the you know actual you know</text><text start="704.88" dur="3.36">like goals and kpis of the economy and</text><text start="706.8" dur="2.88">that i think like these economies and</text><text start="708.24" dur="3.92">communities right now are only starting</text><text start="709.68" dur="4.56">to realize that you know economic like</text><text start="712.16" dur="2.72">maximization is just like not the focus</text><text start="714.24" dur="2.48">and</text><text start="714.88" dur="3.44">i think that&apos;s the that&apos;s a unique</text><text start="716.72" dur="2.96">differentiating factor between you know</text><text start="718.32" dur="3.759">let&apos;s say a company</text><text start="719.68" dur="4.0">an economy uh in general is that an</text><text start="722.079" dur="4.161">economy about it looks at balance</text><text start="723.68" dur="4.24">multiple different goals and purposes uh</text><text start="726.24" dur="4.24">all at once right so like you know a</text><text start="727.92" dur="4.719">nation state you know economy main you</text><text start="730.48" dur="3.599">know optimizing</text><text start="732.639" dur="4.081">optimizes for many different you know</text><text start="734.079" dur="5.521">sort of like uh like kpis from not only</text><text start="736.72" dur="5.2">just gdp growth but gdp per capita</text><text start="739.6" dur="4.96">uh air quality right uh genie</text><text start="741.92" dur="4.32">coefficients uh you know and i think</text><text start="744.56" dur="3.04">when building up a virtual economy it&apos;s</text><text start="746.24" dur="2.159">more like you know you&apos;re trying to</text><text start="747.6" dur="2.64">build</text><text start="748.399" dur="4.24">a viable place for people to thrive on</text><text start="750.24" dur="5.44">top of right so you know culture like</text><text start="752.639" dur="5.841">diversity of you know people ideas</text><text start="755.68" dur="4.64">talent you know uh you know individuals</text><text start="758.48" dur="3.76">that&apos;s also you know another factor that</text><text start="760.32" dur="4.4">you know that enables you know these</text><text start="762.24" dur="4.0">economies to thrive and so i think like</text><text start="764.72" dur="3.359">um</text><text start="766.24" dur="3.52">i think that right now a lot of the you</text><text start="768.079" dur="4.0">know there&apos;s a lot of actually actually</text><text start="769.76" dur="4.0">copycats that are copying axes but</text><text start="772.079" dur="3.601">mostly on an economical layer but you</text><text start="773.76" dur="3.519">know that they yet to really innovate</text><text start="775.68" dur="3.36">you know uh</text><text start="777.279" dur="3.12">on these other aspects that you know</text><text start="779.04" dur="3.84">actually have been sort of thinking</text><text start="780.399" dur="3.761">about but they&apos;ve been less visible and</text><text start="782.88" dur="2.639">i think you know over the next year</text><text start="784.16" dur="3.119">we&apos;ll see you know more plato and</text><text start="785.519" dur="4.081">economies really think more you know</text><text start="787.279" dur="4.481">broadly about how to how what should</text><text start="789.6" dur="4.4">they be optimizing for so i think like</text><text start="791.76" dur="4.16">realistically it&apos;s it&apos;s you know</text><text start="794.0" dur="3.92">the you know the innovation play to earn</text><text start="795.92" dur="3.2">here is more of a mental model like you</text><text start="797.92" dur="2.96">know</text><text start="799.12" dur="4.0">really like a mental model innovation or</text><text start="800.88" dur="4.399">like mental model shift uh you know on</text><text start="803.12" dur="4.64">like how to manage and how to build</text><text start="805.279" dur="3.601">these in-game economies</text><text start="807.76" dur="2.48">interesting</text><text start="808.88" dur="3.44">yeah so i&apos;m gonna i&apos;m hearing a little</text><text start="810.24" dur="3.76">bit about value being multi-dimensional</text><text start="812.32" dur="5.04">you wanna optimize for several different</text><text start="814.0" dur="5.76">kpis not just like gdp of the economy</text><text start="817.36" dur="3.839">um it reminds me of like you know so so</text><text start="819.76" dur="3.199">the podcast that we&apos;re on right now is</text><text start="821.199" dur="3.44">called regenerative crypto economics and</text><text start="822.959" dur="3.921">i&apos;ve been working on a definition of</text><text start="824.639" dur="4.481">that which which is an economic system</text><text start="826.88" dur="4.079">that satisfies human needs creates</text><text start="829.12" dur="3.68">positive externalities and is generally</text><text start="830.959" dur="4.32">net positive and creates balance and</text><text start="832.8" dur="4.399">finds equilibrium is the third component</text><text start="835.279" dur="3.441">there and i&apos;m wondering you know it</text><text start="837.199" dur="3.2">really struck a chord with me when you</text><text start="838.72" dur="4.799">said that it&apos;s it&apos;s building for human</text><text start="840.399" dur="4.56">thriving i i think that um you know it&apos;s</text><text start="843.519" dur="3.201">really hard to boil that down into a</text><text start="844.959" dur="2.721">measurable kpi</text><text start="846.72" dur="2.64">um</text><text start="847.68" dur="3.76">you know how do you think of of an</text><text start="849.36" dur="3.76">economy that&apos;s regenerative or like</text><text start="851.44" dur="3.399">satisfies the needs of the of the</text><text start="853.12" dur="6.399">participants that are in</text><text start="854.839" dur="6.12">it that&apos;s a that is a question</text><text start="859.519" dur="3.601">yeah well if you could solve it now we</text><text start="860.959" dur="4.32">could all go home peter but uh it seems</text><text start="863.12" dur="4.48">like we&apos;re all iterating towards it</text><text start="865.279" dur="4.321">yeah yeah yeah i think uh it&apos;s it is a</text><text start="867.6" dur="3.44">question um you know could you could do</text><text start="869.6" dur="3.12">that for game then</text><text start="871.04" dur="3.039">i&apos;m sure we&apos;re on the right path right</text><text start="872.72" dur="3.04">perhaps you know</text><text start="874.079" dur="4.241">uh you know with</text><text start="875.76" dur="3.6">our physical uh meat space you know uh</text><text start="878.32" dur="4.319">yeah</text><text start="879.36" dur="3.279">and i yeah i think it&apos;s</text><text start="883.44" dur="4.079">it&apos;s a good question i think i&apos;ve gotta</text><text start="885.04" dur="3.52">you know maybe stew on that a bit</text><text start="887.519" dur="4.721">totally</text><text start="888.56" dur="6.24">yeah um well i&apos;m curious uh i&apos;m curious</text><text start="892.24" dur="4.64">if we could back up a little bit uh</text><text start="894.8" dur="4.719">into into sort of like the story of how</text><text start="896.88" dur="4.88">you got into the web 3 space</text><text start="899.519" dur="4.241">and um how the how your history in the</text><text start="901.76" dur="3.519">web 3 space has has brought to you to</text><text start="903.76" dur="3.04">where you are today</text><text start="905.279" dur="2.961">i think that most of our listeners are</text><text start="906.8" dur="3.44">familiar with you</text><text start="908.24" dur="3.76">from your work in founding meta cartel</text><text start="910.24" dur="3.68">and evolving that into a dow and moving</text><text start="912.0" dur="5.12">that forward i know the meta cartel</text><text start="913.92" dur="6.159">mafia uh is is deep in a lot of the</text><text start="917.12" dur="4.88">different crypto events that that i uh</text><text start="920.079" dur="4.081">that i go to i&apos;m curious if you can tell</text><text start="922.0" dur="4.24">us about you know</text><text start="924.16" dur="3.6">what what was that story arc of getting</text><text start="926.24" dur="3.599">into crypto and then getting involved in</text><text start="927.76" dur="4.4">meta cartel and how does it inform how</text><text start="929.839" dur="4.641">you view the space today</text><text start="932.16" dur="4.56">yeah it&apos;s a it&apos;s a funny story i guess</text><text start="934.48" dur="4.0">um i was a designer outside of crypto so</text><text start="936.72" dur="3.679">i was like designing user interfaces</text><text start="938.48" dur="3.2">talk to users doing user research and</text><text start="940.399" dur="4.161">obviously you know</text><text start="941.68" dur="5.599">in late 17 there were all these amazing</text><text start="944.56" dur="5.279">products and end users for me to work</text><text start="947.279" dur="4.401">with right of course it&apos;s just sarcasm</text><text start="949.839" dur="2.881">really terrible sarcasm but you know</text><text start="951.68" dur="2.719">there was it&apos;s just like it was the</text><text start="952.72" dur="4.16">worst time for a designer to actually</text><text start="954.399" dur="4.56">enter crypto no products</text><text start="956.88" dur="4.8">no end products and user products at</text><text start="958.959" dur="4.961">least you know and use applications no</text><text start="961.68" dur="4.48">any sort of use cases at all really just</text><text start="963.92" dur="4.56">clearly identified amongst like payments</text><text start="966.16" dur="4.239">supply chain uh like you know like this</text><text start="968.48" dur="3.599">is the solution looking for a problem</text><text start="970.399" dur="4.24">stage yeah it was like it was mostly</text><text start="972.079" dur="4.481">just like you know maybe kpmg industry</text><text start="974.639" dur="2.961">report you know use cases and that was</text><text start="976.56" dur="3.839">it so</text><text start="977.6" dur="3.52">um i i came in and was like okay [ __ ]</text><text start="980.399" dur="2.8">like</text><text start="981.12" dur="4.24">um i can&apos;t really country as a designer</text><text start="983.199" dur="3.681">so what i can what can i do so</text><text start="985.36" dur="2.88">i i really spent some time digging</text><text start="986.88" dur="2.16">around in history learning about you</text><text start="988.24" dur="3.12">know</text><text start="989.04" dur="4.08">crypto before it was you know about</text><text start="991.36" dur="3.76">blockchains cryptography</text><text start="993.12" dur="3.04">uh i started just like you know learning</text><text start="995.12" dur="2.399">about computer science and having</text><text start="996.16" dur="3.44">computing backgrounds so just like got a</text><text start="997.519" dur="4.161">rough sense of like why blockchains were</text><text start="999.6" dur="3.599">important after i got done i sort of</text><text start="1001.68" dur="2.56">like done this contextual research i</text><text start="1003.199" dur="2.08">started like just contributing to</text><text start="1004.24" dur="2.8">different like</text><text start="1005.279" dur="3.281">open source online communities within</text><text start="1007.04" dur="3.44">the firm ecosystem</text><text start="1008.56" dur="3.36">just like acting almost like</text><text start="1010.48" dur="3.279">just finding things to do from like</text><text start="1011.92" dur="3.839">writing notes to like spell checking</text><text start="1013.759" dur="3.361">like i mean i i would probably claim</text><text start="1015.759" dur="2.961">that you know one of the you know i am</text><text start="1017.12" dur="3.68">in the mastering of your</text><text start="1018.72" dur="4.0">uh credits you know</text><text start="1020.8" dur="3.36">that book uh the book credits mostly and</text><text start="1022.72" dur="3.68">but if you look at my github</text><text start="1024.16" dur="4.96">contributions they&apos;re mostly like typos</text><text start="1026.4" dur="4.08">typos spelling fixes grammar fixes and</text><text start="1029.12" dur="3.439">it wasn&apos;t even</text><text start="1030.48" dur="4.16">it wasn&apos;t even me read like doing i just</text><text start="1032.559" dur="3.441">like took the content like like one day</text><text start="1034.64" dur="2.72">i took the content put in grammarly and</text><text start="1036.0" dur="3.36">realized it was all these spelling</text><text start="1037.36" dur="4.64">mistakes and i was just like i just like</text><text start="1039.36" dur="5.12">ran ran</text><text start="1042.0" dur="4.799">ran like arbitraging between writing the</text><text start="1044.48" dur="3.04">book and grammarly</text><text start="1046.799" dur="1.681">yeah</text><text start="1047.52" dur="3.039">basically</text><text start="1048.48" dur="4.4">and i added some history that i knew and</text><text start="1050.559" dur="4.0">i i did this you know that was like one</text><text start="1052.88" dur="3.039">example i went and i filmed was trying</text><text start="1054.559" dur="2.961">to figure out its governance back then</text><text start="1055.919" dur="3.601">so i was doing like cultural surveys i</text><text start="1057.52" dur="3.84">took those survey results and was like</text><text start="1059.52" dur="3.68">the first one to maybe like decipher</text><text start="1061.36" dur="3.52">them and like synthesize the insights</text><text start="1063.2" dur="2.88">and that was a lot of like user research</text><text start="1064.88" dur="2.96">work that i&apos;ve like sort of done so it&apos;s</text><text start="1066.08" dur="4.24">just like patent recognizing</text><text start="1067.84" dur="4.24">uh and then i realized that you know</text><text start="1070.32" dur="3.76">you know people were talking about</text><text start="1072.08" dur="3.68">yeah like okay how do we build products</text><text start="1074.08" dur="3.2">i mean like how do you improve the build</text><text start="1075.76" dur="2.64">products how do you improve the ux of</text><text start="1077.28" dur="2.48">things and</text><text start="1078.4" dur="3.04">i think medical like you know that&apos;s</text><text start="1079.76" dur="3.36">where medication came out it was like</text><text start="1081.44" dur="3.92">like a working group folks in like user</text><text start="1083.12" dur="4.08">research uh infrastructure mostly meta</text><text start="1085.36" dur="4.16">transactions and hence the name</text><text start="1087.2" dur="4.08">um but i think when working through like</text><text start="1089.52" dur="3.6">working with user uh user experience</text><text start="1091.28" dur="3.2">infrastructure like there&apos;s all these</text><text start="1093.12" dur="2.4">design meetups that kept on talking</text><text start="1094.48" dur="2.88">about like how do we improve key</text><text start="1095.52" dur="4.8">management how do we do that how do we</text><text start="1097.36" dur="4.319">attract gas and no at one point i sort</text><text start="1100.32" dur="3.44">of thought like this makes no [ __ ]</text><text start="1101.679" dur="4.721">sense because it&apos;s like what what use</text><text start="1103.76"

dur="2.08">yeah</text><text start="1209.039" dur="3.601">what are some areas where can come in</text><text start="1210.32" dur="4.56">and add concrete value i think that&apos;s a</text><text

start="1266.24" dur="3.2">to be honest you know i just like i</text><text start="1268.159" dur="3.441">liked you know coordinating and</text><text start="1269.44" dur="3.44">organizing it&apos;s like it&apos;s like it&apos;s like</text><text start="1271.6" dur="3.439">sort of fun</text><text start="1272.88" dur="4.72">right in a way um get a sort of a rush</text><text start="1275.039" dur="5.041">from that um but i think i got back into</text><text start="1277.6" dur="3.84">the coordination role in ethereum uh</text><text start="1280.08" dur="3.2">back then mostly because out of</text><text start="1281.44" dur="3.44">frustration i just realized that like</text><text start="1283.28" dur="3.12">you know when this initial technical</text><text start="1284.88" dur="3.84">working group around meta transactions</text><text start="1286.4" dur="3.519">emerged just like the right this these</text><text start="1288.72" dur="2.8">really really smart engineers weren&apos;t</text><text start="1289.919" dur="3.201">just like coordinating with they weren&apos;t</text><text start="1291.52" dur="3.6">talking to each other they weren&apos;t like</text><text start="1293.12" dur="3.52">like it was like it drove me insane and</text><text start="1295.12" dur="3.6">i realized that this work was something</text><text start="1296.64" dur="4.399">like any monkey could do so i was like</text><text start="1298.72" dur="5.12">all right i can maybe do i can</text><text start="1301.039" dur="4.561">you know i&apos;m i&apos;m time rich you know</text><text start="1303.84" dur="4.64">these other people are you know time</text><text start="1305.6" dur="5.199">poor why don&apos;t i step in here and uh run</text><text start="1308.48" dur="4.24">all this grunt work right and make sure</text><text start="1310.799" dur="3.521">that you know we actually figure out how</text><text start="1312.72" dur="3.6">to standardize mental transactions we</text><text start="1314.32" dur="4.0">figure out how to maybe decentralize the</text><text start="1316.32" dur="3.52">execution of them and i think it just</text><text start="1318.32" dur="4.16">comes from a lot of frustrations it&apos;s</text><text start="1319.84" dur="4.719">like this an annoyance at the you know</text><text start="1322.48" dur="4.16">opportunity cost you know</text><text start="1324.559" dur="4.161">and the lack of uh</text><text start="1326.64" dur="3.76">you know like just this unrealized</text><text start="1328.72" dur="4.079">potential right and i think</text><text start="1330.4" dur="4.72">that&apos;s always been the driver a lot of a</text><text start="1332.799" dur="4.321">lot of the coordination games that i</text><text start="1335.12" dur="3.439">sort of i&apos;ve run and</text><text start="1337.12" dur="2.799">you know like would consider myself this</text><text start="1338.559" dur="2.24">like coordination junkie it&apos;s just like</text><text start="1339.919" dur="2.321">anything</text><text start="1340.799" dur="3.441">that you can like to coordinate on i</text><text start="1342.24" dur="4.48">will like come in themed you know and</text><text start="1344.24" dur="4.559">then phenom and sort of like</text><text start="1346.72" dur="3.839">uh you know look for different ways</text><text start="1348.799" dur="2.561">coordination can happen right</text><text start="1350.559" dur="2.161">um</text><text start="1351.36" dur="3.28">yeah</text><text start="1352.72" dur="3.76">yeah so i&apos;m curious to to</text><text start="1354.64" dur="3.519">to sort of pinch and zoom on that word</text><text start="1356.48" dur="3.6">coordination because i heard from you a</text><text start="1358.159" dur="5.041">very visceral story of being a</text><text start="1360.08" dur="4.8">coordinator of people at small scale um</text><text start="1363.2" dur="2.88">in the meta cartel and then obviously as</text><text start="1364.88" dur="3.76">that grew you were coordinating more</text><text start="1366.08" dur="4.56">people and then um</text><text start="1368.64" dur="4.88">and then i sort of i sort of view</text><text start="1370.64" dur="4.399">ethereum in web 3 as this substrate for</text><text start="1373.52" dur="3.76">human coordination that&apos;s completely</text><text start="1375.039" dur="5.441">scalable because it&apos;s global in nature</text><text start="1377.28" dur="5.279">it&apos;s transparent it&apos;s immutable um and</text><text start="1380.48" dur="3.679">it&apos;s programmable so basically you&apos;ve</text><text start="1382.559" dur="3.681">got this sort of like</text><text start="1384.159" dur="4.961">coordination</text><text start="1386.24" dur="4.319">in the ether pun intended and and so you</text><text start="1389.12" dur="3.6">know like what&apos;s the scale from like</text><text start="1390.559" dur="5.041">organizing a group of five or ten people</text><text start="1392.72" dur="6.48">in in the sort of old world to global</text><text start="1395.6" dur="5.12">scale coordination in in your view uh</text><text start="1399.2" dur="3.28">you know like is is that like a linear</text><text start="1400.72" dur="3.6">scale to you do you think about what</text><text start="1402.48" dur="3.28">you&apos;re doing now is just coordination at</text><text start="1404.32" dur="3.839">a greater scale now you&apos;re a capital</text><text start="1405.76" dur="4.56">allocator as opposed to like a like a a</text><text start="1408.159" dur="4.721">project manager is is that is that a</text><text start="1410.32" dur="3.92">linear scaler for you</text><text start="1412.88" dur="2.72">it&apos;s an interesting yeah it&apos;s an</text><text start="1414.24" dur="2.64">interesting question because you know i</text><text start="1415.6" dur="3.68">think</text><text start="1416.88" dur="4.08">i you yeah like i i you know initially</text><text start="1419.28" dur="3.04">when i was organizing medical talk i&apos;ve</text><text start="1420.96" dur="3.68">always been you know folks in small</text><text start="1422.32" dur="4.56">groups and you know i and then and then</text><text start="1424.64" dur="4.08">hindsight you know i didn&apos;t</text><text start="1426.88" dur="4.08">i kept these groups small and tight and</text><text start="1428.72" dur="4.4">coordinated and i grew you know and i</text><text start="1430.96" dur="4.0">sort of like grew groups i almost scaled</text><text start="1433.12" dur="3.439">the medication ecosystem horizontally</text><text start="1434.96" dur="3.28">you know by like starting different</text><text start="1436.559" dur="3.841">squads focusing different objectives and</text><text start="1438.24" dur="3.6">then scaling out businesses</text><text start="1440.4" dur="3.44">meta factory</text><text start="1441.84" dur="4.0">um metagame like is that what you mean</text><text start="1443.84" dur="4.0">by how exactly yeah correct like medical</text><text start="1445.84" dur="3.439">adventures and so on right and as</text><text start="1447.84" dur="4.16">opposed to create you know just focusing</text><text start="1449.279" dur="4.4">like growing large groups of a single</text><text start="1452.0" dur="4.64">monolithic large group and</text><text start="1453.679" dur="4.961">i think you know in charleston uh 20</text><text start="1456.64" dur="3.36">when d5 somehow came about like you know</text><text start="1458.64" dur="2.72">you have these like protocols that like</text><text start="1460.0" dur="3.2">launch or like hunt like tens of</text><text start="1461.36" dur="3.679">thousands of users and community members</text><text start="1463.2" dur="2.959">at once and i was like oh have i been</text><text start="1465.039" dur="2.801">doing things</text><text start="1466.159" dur="3.281">wrong and i&apos;m like this is this a</text><text start="1467.84" dur="3.439">different way of like coordinating or</text><text start="1469.44" dur="4.479">starting off and yeah it was a new</text><text start="1471.279" dur="4.721">pattern but i think soon after like</text><text start="1473.919" dur="4.081">when these larger you know larger</text><text start="1476.0" dur="3.84">supposed dowels like really started to</text><text start="1478.0" dur="3.84">started like to fail to coordinate i</text><text start="1479.84" dur="3.68">realized that you know there were no</text><text start="1481.84" dur="3.6">shortcuts to coordination you do have to</text><text start="1483.52" dur="3.44">actually like you know there is this</text><text start="1485.44" dur="3.52">like process that you can&apos;t skip which</text><text start="1486.96" dur="3.52">is this process of like</text><text start="1488.96" dur="2.719">establishing a mission creating clarity</text><text start="1490.48" dur="2.559">around goals</text><text start="1491.679" dur="2.561">bringing you know finding countries that</text><text start="1493.039" dur="3.12">care about those goals and then figuring</text><text start="1494.24" dur="3.28">out a way to retain them and reward them</text><text start="1496.159" dur="2.481">and keep them you know focus on those</text><text start="1497.52" dur="3.2">goals right and</text><text start="1498.64" dur="4.159">you know these things always start small</text><text start="1500.72" dur="2.959">so you know and over the last two years</text><text start="1502.799" dur="2.401">i think</text><text start="1503.679" dur="4.401">i&apos;ve come back i&apos;ve come full circle</text><text start="1505.2" dur="4.079">i&apos;ve like you know uh did my did my own</text><text start="1508.08" dur="2.959">experiments</text><text start="1509.279" dur="3.561">saw how uh you know the ecosystem sort</text><text start="1511.039" dur="4.081">of like defaulted to experiments and</text><text start="1512.84" dur="4.439">realized that was interesting but then</text><text start="1515.12" dur="4.08">that didn&apos;t work so i think i&apos;m coming</text><text start="1517.279" dur="3.361">back full circle and realizing that or</text><text start="1519.2" dur="3.92">dial should actually really start small</text><text start="1520.64" dur="4.159">regardless even regardless of you know</text><text start="1523.12" dur="4.159">how many users you have right now you</text><text start="1524.799" dur="5.36">know even and that&apos;s sort of even a side</text><text start="1527.279" dur="4.88">side topic where i think you know</text><text start="1530.159" dur="3.601">uh doubt you know</text><text start="1532.159" dur="3.52">like instead of like doing large air</text><text start="1533.76" dur="2.88">drops you know of tokens and to</text><text start="1535.679" dur="2.24">community</text><text start="1536.64" dur="2.56">members or users you should actually</text><text start="1537.919" dur="4.0">always be starting</text><text

and like pods and then you</text><text start="1545.84" dur="3.12">know and then you know once you have a</text><text start="1547.52" dur="3.519">contributed community</text><text start="1548.96" dur="4.4">then you know uh retroactively disputing</text><text start="1551.039" dur="4.721">ownership so that you already have a you</text><text start="1553.36" dur="3.919">know fully functional uh

start="1562.96" dur="3.68">building community contributors it&apos;s</text><text start="1564.64" dur="4.96">just like there were a few like you know</text><text start="1566.64" dur="6.96">um

know over the</text><text start="1672.72" dur="3.04">years</text><text start="1673.84" dur="4.48">like this would be the only one one</text><text start="1675.76" dur="3.919">single takeaway is that you know we</text><text start="1678.32" dur="2.8">from very beginning we said you know we</text><text start="1679.679" dur="4.48">wanted to curate the community based on</text><text start="1681.12" dur="4.72">values and a strong mission um which was</text><text start="1684.159" dur="3.52">back then and the missions evolved right</text><text start="1685.84" dur="3.199">of medication but you know initially it</text><text start="1687.679" dur="3.201">was like build ux infrastructure index</text><text start="1689.039" dur="3.441">it was like build you know use cases and</text><text start="1690.88" dur="3.6">experiment and then it slows like</text><text start="1692.48" dur="4.079">experiment shifts into experiment with</text><text start="1694.48" dur="4.16">use cases and start like experiment with</text><text start="1696.559" dur="3.84">dowels and coordination mechanisms right</text><text start="1698.64" dur="4.0">and i think just experimentation was</text><text start="1700.399" dur="4.241">like at this core and people wanted to</text><text start="1702.64" dur="4.8">just see things emerge regardless of</text><text start="1704.64" dur="4.72">like whether there was funding that was</text><text start="1707.44" dur="3.76">you know that had you know like i guess</text><text start="1709.36" dur="3.039">agenda like agenda-driven funding right</text><text start="1711.2" dur="3.12">like you know we were doing grants</text><text start="1712.399" dur="4.241">funding mostly because it was just the</text><text start="1714.32" dur="3.76">fastest way to get an experiment built</text><text start="1716.64" dur="3.6">and shipped right</text><text start="1718.08" dur="3.839">um with no strings attached and we just</text><text start="1720.24" dur="3.12">wanted to purely see the results of</text><text start="1721.919" dur="3.76">these experiments</text><text start="1723.36" dur="4.319">um so i would definitely say that you</text><text start="1725.679" dur="3.12">know that&apos;s the one thing we got right</text><text start="1727.679" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="1728.799" dur="3.521">yeah and i think like you know it&apos;s sort</text><text start="1730.799" dur="3.201">of this effect of like</text><text start="1732.32" dur="4.16">you know um</text><text start="1734.0" dur="4.0">the first like you know 20 the first you</text><text start="1736.48" dur="4.24">know not even 20 the first five</text><text start="1738.0" dur="4.08">contributors you you have right uh are</text><text start="1740.72" dur="3.04">going to

start="2126.72" dur="4.96">doing it now at a small scale and</text><text start="2129.44" dur="6.399">i think we uh like you know a few steps</text><text start="2131.68" dur="4.159">away from doing that like a global scale</text><text start="2135.92" dur="3.919">yeah a couple reactions to what you said</text><text start="2137.839" dur="4.401">about um you know sort of everything</text><text start="2139.839" dur="3.681">being games or a coordination game um i</text><text start="2142.24" dur="3.359">guess you know the questions that that</text><text start="2143.52" dur="3.44">sort of toggles on in my mind is well</text><text start="2145.599" dur="3.441">what kind of games are we are we</text><text start="2146.96" dur="3.6">building um because there&apos;s there&apos;s a</text><text start="2149.04" dur="3.84">there&apos;s a</text><text start="2150.56" dur="4.96">a precedent in my mind from web 2 that</text><text start="2152.88" dur="4.4">gamification is just a cheap trick that</text><text start="2155.52" dur="3.28">the management team uses in order to get</text><text start="2157.28" dur="3.44">more actions out of their users and</text><text start="2158.8" dur="3.52">return more value to shareholders yeah</text><text start="2160.72" dur="3.68">and that&apos;s like that&apos;s not the version</text><text start="2162.32" dur="4.16">of the world that i want to that i want</text><text start="2164.4" dur="3.84">to build you know having been in the</text><text start="2166.48" dur="4.08">sausage maker of a web 2 startup for</text><text start="2168.24" dur="4.4">about 10 years um you know and i&apos;m</text><text start="2170.56" dur="5.36">wondering like are the games that we&apos;re</text><text start="2172.64" dur="5.68">building in web 3 uh zero sum games or</text><text start="2175.92" dur="4.4">are they positive some games and you</text><text start="2178.32" dur="3.759">know if there&apos;s a possibility of both</text><text start="2180.32" dur="4.56">how do we push things to more positive</text><text start="2182.079" dur="5.921">some games regenerative crypto economics</text><text start="2184.88" dur="4.56">within within these economies</text><text start="2188.0" dur="3.04">yeah it&apos;s a very good point i i think</text><text start="2189.44" dur="3.44">you know yeah like coordination like you</text><text start="2191.04" dur="3.28">know smart contracts can be used to</text><text start="2192.88" dur="4.16">build there&apos;s some all positive some</text><text start="2194.32" dur="4.64">games and um i think this is</text><text start="2197.04" dur="3.84">where you know the beauty i think the</text><text start="2198.96" dur="4.08">fact that it&apos;s all digital you know for</text><text start="2200.88" dur="4.16">most for the most part is that we get to</text><text start="2203.04" dur="3.2">choose which systems we can uh we want</text><text start="2205.04" dur="3.12">to be a part of which ones we want to</text><text start="2206.24" dur="5.04">rage quit and leave right</text><text start="2208.16" dur="5.28">um it provides us like total optionality</text><text start="2211.28" dur="4.079">um that the physical kind of really</text><text start="2213.44" dur="3.36">afford us right so</text><text start="2215.359" dur="3.76">i think that</text><text start="2216.8" dur="3.92">you know um some embarrassing overcome</text><text start="2219.119" dur="3.521">probably greed i think like there&apos;s a</text><text start="2220.72" dur="4.0">decent chance that there are some games</text><text start="2222.64" dur="3.04">a more lucrative you know like musical</text><text start="2224.72" dur="4.0">chairs</text><text start="2225.68" dur="4.56">uh you know um</text><text start="2228.72" dur="2.48">right yeah positive sub games can tend</text><text start="2230.24" dur="2.16">to you know</text><text start="2231.2" dur="3.36">i think the question&apos;s like how do you</text><text start="2232.4" dur="5.04">how do you use almost like you know</text><text start="2234.56" dur="5.039">incentives to boot like to you know like</text><text start="2237.44" dur="2.159">to</text><text start="2239.839" dur="3.601">yeah how do we use you know incentives</text><text start="2241.359" dur="4.641">to like create you know competitive you</text><text start="2243.44" dur="4.399">know like coordination games you know</text><text start="2246.0" dur="3.52">against like you know azure someone&apos;s</text><text start="2247.839" dur="2.641">right and and i think that&apos;s sort of the</text><text start="2249.52" dur="2.8">goal</text><text start="2250.48" dur="2.8">um</text><text start="2252.32" dur="2.799">and</text><text start="2253.28" dur="3.839">you know that may also actually involved</text><text start="2255.119" dur="3.601">like in the whole ecosystem spending a</text><text start="2257.119" dur="3.041">couple years building zeros of games too</text><text start="2258.72" dur="4.08">just to figure out how it works you know</text><text start="2260.16" dur="4.24">and realizing you know what&apos;s broken and</text><text start="2262.8" dur="4.08">you know maybe how to use how to</text><text start="2264.4" dur="3.439">effectively build them right if you so</text><text start="2266.88" dur="2.479">almost like</text><text start="2267.839" dur="3.681">you know maybe we have to reverse</text><text start="2269.359" dur="3.841">engineer you know zero sum ones before</text><text start="2271.52" dur="3.12">we build uh positive someone&apos;s true</text><text start="2273.2" dur="3.04">right so i think like</text><text start="2274.64" dur="2.64">how we get this sort of sort of question</text><text start="2276.24" dur="2.72">mark</text><text start="2277.28" dur="4.64">yeah yeah and there&apos;s always an option</text><text start="2278.96" dur="4.8">to i think like to reverse engineer</text><text start="2281.92" dur="4.32">positive some games also and when you</text><text start="2283.76" dur="4.96">told me that how meta cartel started and</text><text start="2286.24" dur="5.839">each pod was formed around a mission and</text><text start="2288.72" dur="5.68">shared goals i almost think of that as</text><text start="2292.079" dur="4.081">you know you&apos;re establishing the seed of</text><text start="2294.4" dur="4.32">wanting to create positive sum games at</text><text start="2296.16" dur="4.0">the center of your community um just</text><text start="2298.72" dur="3.359">being familiar with what raid guild does</text><text start="2300.16" dur="3.04">and metagame does and the other projects</text><text start="2302.079" dur="2.321">that have come out of meta cartel i</text><text start="2303.2" dur="2.8">think you&apos;ve like</text><text start="2304.4" dur="3.199">without knowing it maybe engineered to</text><text start="2306.0" dur="2.96">create more positive some games at the</text><text start="2307.599" dur="2.721">center of each of the groups that you&apos;ve</text><text start="2308.96" dur="4.0">been involved in and that&apos;s at least</text><text start="2310.32" dur="4.32">what i&apos;ve observed from the outside</text><text start="2312.96" dur="4.0">i think humanity is going to face this</text><text start="2314.64" dur="4.08">like massive like blue pill red pill</text><text start="2316.96" dur="4.48">moment of like do you want to</text><text start="2318.72" dur="4.32">participate in like positive some games</text><text start="2321.44" dur="3.28">you know or do you want to participate</text><text start="2323.04" dur="4.0">in like zero sum ones that are</text><text start="2324.72" dur="4.32">potentially much more you know uh</text><text start="2327.04" dur="3.6">lucrative financially perhaps you know</text><text start="2329.04" dur="3.44">to an individual right and it&apos;s going to</text><text start="2330.64" dur="2.719">be this like uh you know we&apos;re going to</text><text start="2332.48" dur="3.52">have</text><text start="2333.359" dur="4.48">almost entire ecosystems of that exist</text><text start="2336.0" dur="3.68">of both positive some negative some i</text><text start="2337.839" dur="3.52">mean i&apos;ll you know i always throw some</text><text start="2339.68" dur="3.04">ones right and uh</text><text start="2341.359" dur="3.681">i ultimately think it&apos;s like a very</text><text start="2342.72" dur="4.56">human sort of uh</text><text start="2345.04" dur="4.0">factor that like will ultimately lend us</text><text start="2347.28" dur="4.64">like moving that will ultimately move us</text><text start="2349.04" dur="4.24">towards one one side or another right</text><text start="2351.92" dur="2.72">um</text><text start="2353.28" dur="3.28">yeah</text><text start="2354.64" dur="3.76">yeah i think that that&apos;s right although</text><text start="2356.56" dur="4.08">i guess i am writing a book called green</text><text start="2358.4" dur="3.92">pilled right now so i would say that one</text><text start="2360.64" dur="4.16">of those options should be the green</text><text start="2362.32" dur="4.56">pill um i do think that</text><text start="2364.8" dur="3.36">uh i i do think that you know one of the</text><text start="2366.88" dur="2.719">things that i sort of struggle with is</text><text start="2368.16" dur="4.48">like how do we align that short-term</text><text start="2369.599" dur="3.841">profit motive with</text><text start="2372.64" dur="3.199">with</text><text start="2373.44" dur="4.08">uh not externalizing harm so basically</text><text start="2375.839" dur="3.601">how do we build these systems where you</text><text start="2377.52" dur="4.16">can make the rationally right choice for</text><text start="2379.44" dur="4.399">yourself and it can be the right choice</text><text start="2381.68" dur="3.439">for it&apos;s it&apos;s the bento box right it&apos;s</text><text start="2383.839" dur="3.041">like i&apos;m making the choice the right</text><text start="2385.119" dur="5.281">choice for instant gratification but</text><text start="2386.88" dur="7.04">also for my future self uh for my family</text><text start="2390.4" dur="5.52">my community my nation my world and and</text><text start="2393.92" dur="3.919">it&apos;s like expanding out over in group</text><text start="2395.92" dur="3.6">out group axis and then also the time</text><text start="2397.839" dur="4.0">axis like how do we align those</text><text start="2399.52" dur="4.64">incentive games such that it the</text><text start="2401.839" dur="4.961">rational way to play them in</text><text start="2404.16" dur="4.4">self-interest is is also the thing that</text><text start="2406.8" dur="3.6">externalizes the most good for the world</text><text start="2408.56" dur="5.44">that&apos;s that&apos;s the nirvana</text><text start="2410.4" dur="6.08">uh game game design that i&apos;m looking for</text><text start="2414.0" dur="4.0">yeah the bento box is really great</text><text start="2416.48" dur="3.28">because it&apos;s like you know it&apos;s a way to</text><text start="2418.0" dur="4.24">just like write down the long-term</text><text start="2419.76" dur="4.4">implications right of your decisions and</text><text start="2422.24" dur="3.2">i think you know um people tend to be</text><text start="2424.16" dur="3.439">short-sighted you know when making</text><text start="2425.44" dur="4.639">decisions without realizing you know</text><text start="2427.599" dur="3.681">that long-term benefits as well right so</text><text start="2430.079" dur="2.881">um yeah for those who don&apos;t know</text><text start="2431.28" dur="4.0">bensonvox is like this way to visualize</text><text start="2432.96" dur="3.84">you know the impacts and implications of</text><text start="2435.28" dur="3.44">how you view the world and how you make</text><text start="2436.8" dur="4.72">decisions right and um</text><text start="2438.72" dur="4.96">yeah let&apos;s check it out um</text><text start="2441.52" dur="3.52">totally um well i guess i we should</text><text start="2443.68" dur="2.96">probably wrap up at this point is there</text><text start="2445.04" dur="3.84">anything that i didn&apos;t ask that you want</text><text start="2446.64"
