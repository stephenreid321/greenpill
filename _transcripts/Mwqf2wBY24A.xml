dur="4.62">retroactive public goods funding is that</text><text start="34.32" dur="5.52">it&apos;s easier to know in retrospect and</text><text start="37.14" dur="4.2">retroactively which public goods were</text><text start="39.84" dur="3.539">actually good</text><text start="41.34" dur="4.32">um and so what if we created an</text><text start="43.379" dur="3.84">infrastructure for dropping tokens on</text><text start="45.66" dur="3.66">people who had created public goods for</text><text start="47.219" dur="3.961">the world and then over time as people</text><text start="49.32" dur="3.6">start

that</text><text start="63.96" dur="4.019">they will get an exit one day so man I&apos;m</text><text start="66.42" dur="4.14">just so bullish on retroactive public</text><text start="67.979" dur="4.68">goods funding and uh I guess you could</text><text start="70.56" dur="6.3">say I&apos;m optimistic about it</text><text start="72.659" dur="6.021">um so I I view optimism and git coin

about</text><text start="234.12" dur="5.46">retroactive public goods funding round</text><text start="236.7" dur="5.28">two so give us the what why and the how</text><text start="239.58" dur="5.159">what&apos;s what&apos;s going on yeah I&apos;m excited</text><text start="241.98" dur="5.52">about it too and I&apos;m happy to be here so</text><text start="244.739" dur="5.461">retro PDF number two retro retroactive</text><text start="247.5" dur="4.62">public goods funding round two so</text><text start="250.2" dur="4.44">um retroactive public goods funding is</text><text start="252.12" dur="4.92">this concept that optimism is putting a</text><text start="254.64" dur="4.86">lot of time and effort and love into</text><text start="257.04" dur="4.08">it&apos;s not optimism specific</text><text start="259.5" dur="3.9">um I think folks in the Bitcoin Universe</text><text start="261.12" dur="3.48">are familiar with that idea as well but</text><text start="263.4" dur="3.359">it&apos;s something that we&apos;re really leaning</text><text start="264.6" dur="3.659">into to both grow our ecosystem and</text><text start="266.759" dur="5.041">bring about the future that we&apos;re really</text><text start="268.259" dur="6.841">excited about so retro PDF is basically</text><text start="271.8" dur="5.28">this idea that it&apos;s easier to look back</text><text start="275.1" dur="4.14">at what was useful than it is to make</text><text start="277.08" dur="5.58">predictions about what will be useful in</text><text start="279.24" dur="5.82">the future so there are a lot of reasons</text><text start="282.66" dur="4.2">this basic idea is applicable but very</text><text start="285.06" dur="3.9">often we spend a lot of effort trying to</text><text start="286.86" dur="3.96">predict whether a group of people or</text><text start="288.96" dur="4.5">whether a project or whether some amount</text><text start="290.82" dur="4.5">of effort will have positive returns to</text><text start="293.46" dur="2.7">a community or to a business going</text><text start="295.32" dur="3.78">forward</text><text start="296.16" dur="4.68">what retro pgf does is flip that around</text><text start="299.1" dur="3.599">and say if we look back at the past</text><text start="300.84" dur="4.5">quarter or look back at the past week or</text><text start="302.699" dur="5.0">look back at the past decade what work</text><text start="305.34" dur="5.4">made a difference over that time period</text><text start="307.699" dur="5.081">you can actually see oh 10 000 people</text><text start="310.74" dur="4.08">use this open source project or this</text><text start="312.78" dur="3.84">teacher educated yeah I don&apos;t know 50</text><text start="314.82" dur="3.78">people who won Nobel prizes and you can</text><text start="316.62" dur="3.54">actually just measure the outcomes of</text><text start="318.6" dur="3.84">that work as opposed to trying to guess</text><text start="320.16" dur="3.66">how something will go in the future so</text><text start="322.44" dur="3.3">how this applies to the optimism</text><text start="323.82" dur="2.58">universe is that</text><text start="325.74" dur="2.82">um</text><text start="326.4" dur="4.019">optimism cares very deeply about funding</text><text start="328.56" dur="4.02">public goods we are on this Mission</text><text start="330.419" dur="4.801">along with the rest of our crypto family</text><text start="332.58" dur="4.74">to as I like to think of it kind of</text><text start="335.22" dur="4.56">expand the diversity of human</text><text start="337.32" dur="4.379">coordination systems and scaling</text><text start="339.78" dur="3.96">ethereum is a really big part of that so</text><text start="341.699" dur="3.901">at its core optimism is trying to make</text><text start="343.74" dur="3.84">more block space available so we can</text><text start="345.6" dur="3.539">bring about this new censorship</text><text start="347.58" dur="3.899">resistant economy and sort of</text><text start="349.139" dur="4.681">coordination system but</text><text start="351.479" dur="5.16">taking that one step further we think in</text><text start="353.82" dur="4.8">order to get there we need to build a</text><text start="356.639" dur="4.321">profit motive for the production of</text><text start="358.62" dur="5.4">public goods and to bring about that</text><text start="360.96" dur="5.579">profit profit motive we use retro pgf so</text><text start="364.02" dur="4.739">long-winded abstract Spiel but basically</text><text start="366.539" dur="4.261">this is the second version of that</text><text start="368.759" dur="4.561">experiment that we&apos;re running it&apos;s a</text><text start="370.8" dur="4.26">rather complicated thing to implement</text><text start="373.32" dur="5.04">right the idea might be simple but there</text><text start="375.06" dur="6.6">are a thousand variables in each round</text><text start="378.36" dur="4.679">and so rpgf2 is our our second</text><text start="381.66" dur="2.819">experiment where we&apos;re tweaking some of</text><text start="383.039" dur="3.061">those variables and trying to see how</text><text start="384.479" dur="2.701">that affects the outcomes that it</text><text start="386.1" dur="3.78">creates</text><text start="387.18" dur="4.38">amazing so um</text><text start="389.88" dur="3.12">I think I&apos;ve heard Carl talk about this</text><text start="391.56" dur="3.72">Carl flourish one of the founders of</text><text start="393.0" dur="4.319">optimism talks about like building a</text><text start="395.28" dur="5.639">world in which it&apos;s as profitable to</text><text start="397.319" dur="6.541">build public goods as it is to launch a</text><text start="400.919" dur="4.681">VC back startup and then once you have</text><text start="403.86" dur="4.14">that world then the whole Capital</text><text start="405.6" dur="5.64">allocation infrastructure that&apos;s you</text><text start="408.0" dur="4.979">know funding the next pets.com or photo</text><text start="411.24" dur="4.019">sharing app you know stuff that Silicon</text><text start="412.979" dur="5.041">Valley funds can actually be pointed at</text><text start="415.259" dur="5.761">public goods because that Capital now</text><text start="418.02" dur="5.34">has a belief that they can have returns</text><text start="421.02" dur="4.14">so the retroactive public goods kind of</text><text start="423.36" dur="3.119">creates a credible promise of an exit</text><text start="425.16" dur="4.44">for the public goods that people care</text><text start="426.479" dur="5.521">about and then once people realize that</text><text start="429.6" dur="4.8">they can start making investments in the</text><text start="432.0" dur="4.68">present in public goods assuming that</text><text start="434.4" dur="3.48">they have a credible path to exit in the</text><text start="436.68" dur="4.32">future so it kind of shifts the game</text><text start="437.88" dur="5.28">theory of of public goods did I get that</text><text start="441.0" dur="4.5">directionally right at all a hundred</text><text start="443.16" dur="4.379">percent yeah there&apos;s there&apos;s some really</text><text start="445.5" dur="3.96">exciting stuff in that exact concept</text><text start="447.539" dur="3.66">that I think is</text><text start="449.46" dur="3.06">um super powerful and can change the</text><text start="451.199" dur="2.821">game for people who are building public</text><text start="452.52" dur="3.239">goods whether that&apos;s open source</text><text start="454.02" dur="3.66">software or in the long term hopefully</text><text start="455.759" dur="3.421">public goods Beyond crypto Beyond</text><text start="457.68" dur="3.06">technology in general that&apos;s the that&apos;s</text><text start="459.18" dur="2.82">the dream yeah those things should be</text><text start="460.74" dur="2.88">investable right those people should</text><text start="462.0" dur="4.38">have the chance at an exit because</text><text start="463.62" dur="6.0">oftentimes those types of contributions</text><text start="466.38" dur="4.8">are providing more impact to society and</text><text start="469.62" dur="4.32">we just historically don&apos;t fund them</text><text start="471.18" dur="5.16">whether that&apos;s again the maintenance of</text><text start="473.94" dur="5.22">Open Source software or whether that is</text><text start="476.34" dur="4.62">the type of effort that makes a local</text><text start="479.16" dur="3.599">community better or the type of global</text><text start="480.96" dur="3.299">effort that makes our climate better</text><text start="482.759" dur="3.421">there are a lot of ways where this kind</text><text start="484.259" dur="6.301">of lack of symmetry and funding</text><text start="486.18" dur="5.639">opportunity um manifests yeah</text><text start="490.56" dur="3.24">um so I want to camp a little bit more</text><text start="491.819" dur="3.061">on the theory in the in the vision and</text><text start="493.8" dur="3.78">then we&apos;ll get into the actual</text><text start="494.88" dur="4.439">retroactive yeah in the ground too</text><text start="497.58" dur="4.08">um people who are watching on video will</text><text start="499.319" dur="4.201">see behind me I have this uh this crypto</text><text start="501.66" dur="5.099">art made by art by Nelly it was this</text><text start="503.52" dur="6.119">amazing uh crypto artist and um it&apos;s</text><text start="506.759" dur="4.681">it&apos;s called ethers Phoenix and this is</text><text start="509.639" dur="4.621">this idea that Carl flourish has had</text><text start="511.44" dur="5.099">about the game theory of retroactive</text><text start="514.26" dur="3.54">public goods funding on ethereum I&apos;m</text><text start="516.539" dur="4.201">wondering if you could take a swing at</text><text start="517.8" dur="3.96">explaining uh at at talking about ethers</text><text start="520.74" dur="3.78">Phoenix</text><text start="521.76" dur="4.92">yeah for sure so</text><text start="524.52" dur="3.48">um ethers Phoenix is this basic idea</text><text start="526.68" dur="2.58">that</text><text start="528.0" dur="4.44">um</text><text start="529.26" dur="6.84">in the long term</text><text start="532.44" dur="4.92">there is a like a a I I don&apos;t want to</text><text start="536.1" dur="3.239">use the word Utopia that might sound too</text><text start="537.36" dur="3.599">Grandma Z but there&apos;s a utopian state</text><text start="539.339" dur="4.921">where public where the production of</text><text start="540.959" dur="4.681">public goods is rewarded and there are a</text><text start="544.26" dur="3.24">lot of different paths to get there</text><text start="545.64" dur="3.42">there is a there is a lot of different</text><text start="547.5" dur="4.019">effort that has to take place in order</text><text start="549.06" dur="4.44">to reach that future State and very</text><text start="551.519" dur="4.32">simply the</text><text start="553.5" dur="5.279">effort to bring about that future state</text><text start="555.839" dur="6.18">is itself a public good</text><text start="558.779" dur="6.361">and so if you take those two pieces of</text><text start="562.019" dur="4.801">of logic like future state where the</text><text start="565.14" dur="4.139">production of public goods is well</text><text start="566.82" dur="6.24">funded and any work to get to that</text><text start="569.279" dur="7.021">future state is itself a public good you</text><text start="573.06" dur="4.8">can basically think of the work to bring</text><text start="576.3" dur="4.2">about ethers Phoenix as something that</text><text start="577.86" dur="5.22">itself would be rewarded so it&apos;s like in</text><text start="580.5" dur="3.5">my head this little recursive</text><text start="583.08" dur="4.68">um</text><text start="584.0" dur="5.2">motivation to create</text><text start="587.76" dur="2.88">that end state that we&apos;re working</text><text start="589.2" dur="3.9">towards and it&apos;s the idea that like</text><text start="590.64" dur="4.62">those types of</text><text start="593.1" dur="3.179">projects whether that&apos;s retro PDF number</text><text start="595.26" dur="2.639">two whether that&apos;s something you&apos;re</text><text start="596.279" dur="2.881">doing tiny in your own world whether</text><text start="597.899" dur="3.06">that&apos;s creating the green pill podcast</text><text start="599.16" dur="3.84">whether that&apos;s telling your friend about</text><text start="600.959" dur="3.781">this type of idea all of that work will</text><text start="603.0"

start="608.279" dur="3.12">think we&apos;ll get there yeah what I like</text><text start="610.32" dur="3.06">is that it takes this idea of</text><text start="611.399" dur="4.38">retroactive public goods funding that&apos;s</text><text start="613.38" dur="4.139">like 10 syllables but it takes it takes</text><text start="615.779" dur="2.821">the idea of the game theory of retracted</text><text start="617.519" dur="2.94">public goods funding and it makes me</text><text start="618.6" dur="3.48">feel like like I&apos;m in like a Marvel</text><text start="620.459" dur="3.361">comic or something like that ethers</text><text start="622.08" dur="4.02">Phoenix is rising from the ashes of the</text><text start="623.82" dur="5.28">coordination tools of ethereum and</text><text start="626.1"

think it&apos;s like it&apos;s</text><text start="637.56" dur="3.719">really elegant and</text><text start="639.54" dur="2.94">um you know depending on who I&apos;m talking</text><text start="641.279" dur="2.341">to if I&apos;m talking to economists I&apos;ll</text><text start="642.48" dur="2.64">talk about retroactive public goods</text><text start="643.62" dur="2.82">funding and the mechanisms but if I&apos;m</text><text start="645.12" dur="3.42">talking more General audience we can</text><text start="646.44" dur="4.26">talk about retro or ethers Phoenix and</text><text start="648.54" dur="6.0">and they&apos;re totally complementary</text><text start="650.7" dur="5.16">yeah it&apos;s it also makes this abstract</text><text start="654.54" dur="1.979">idea you know when you meet someone and</text><text start="655.86" dur="2.4">you feel like there&apos;s something</text><text start="656.519" dur="2.94">simpatico you like kind of feel like</text><text start="658.26" dur="3.3">you&apos;re on the same wavelength you&apos;re</text><text start="659.459" dur="4.201">like oh all right we get each other in a</text><text start="661.56" dur="3.719">certain way this kind of makes that</text><text start="663.66" dur="3.239">feeling a little bit more concrete</text><text start="665.279" dur="4.441">because it&apos;s like oh we&apos;re actually on</text><text start="666.899" dur="5.221">the same secret or not so secret team</text><text start="669.72" dur="4.739">like we&apos;re actually it&apos;s not just a vibe</text><text start="672.12" dur="4.98">that we caught it&apos;s actually us working</text><text start="674.459" dur="5.341">toward the same long-term abstract thing</text><text start="677.1" dur="4.5">and so that type of idea is like a</text><text start="679.8" dur="4.14">little ear worm that I think</text><text start="681.6" dur="4.14">I mean even creating the concept of</text><text start="683.94" dur="3.36">ethers Phoenix itself helps bring about</text><text start="685.74" dur="4.8">ethers Phoenix so I don&apos;t know how how</text><text start="687.3" dur="5.88">far down the recursion you can go before</text><text start="690.54" dur="5.34">my head falls off but uh stuck too</text><text start="693.18" dur="4.74">deeper yeah yeah it helps like prevent</text><text start="695.88" dur="4.079">the kind of defeatism that um is</text><text start="697.92" dur="5.039">increasingly prevalent not only in</text><text start="699.959" dur="5.221">crypto but I don&apos;t know globally and</text><text start="702.959" dur="4.741">um that sort of thing is huge for for</text><text start="705.18" dur="3.74">continuing optimism yeah</text><text start="707.7" dur="3.3">um</text><text start="708.92" dur="3.46">it&apos;s funny that you just name dropped</text><text start="711.0" dur="3.06">the name of the project that&apos;s doing</text><text start="712.38" dur="4.019">this optimism yeah</text><text start="714.06" dur="4.5">um but medically I like that</text><text start="716.399" dur="3.541">um so so yeah uh let&apos;s let&apos;s get let&apos;s</text><text start="718.56" dur="3.42">actually get into the mechanism so</text><text start="719.94" dur="4.62">retractive public goods funding round</text><text start="721.98" dur="5.88">two when is it how do people participate</text><text start="724.56" dur="4.74">how does it work and and</text><text start="727.86" dur="3.419">um you know how much how much capital is</text><text start="729.3" dur="4.68">going to be allocated during this during</text><text start="731.279" dur="4.921">this round yeah for sure so we are</text><text start="733.98" dur="4.56">recording this conversation on Tuesday</text><text start="736.2" dur="6.36">January the 24th we are smack in the</text><text start="738.54" dur="7.38">middle of the nomination window so uh</text><text start="742.56" dur="7.5">the way retro PDF runs very simply is</text><text start="745.92" dur="7.68">there is a declared scope so at the</text><text start="750.06" dur="6.3">outset of the round we&apos;ll say</text><text start="753.6" dur="4.919">public goods and contributions that fit</text><text start="756.36" dur="4.62">these criteria are eligible for funding</text><text start="758.519" dur="3.661">in this round so right now that&apos;s a set</text><text start="760.98" dur="3.419">of guidelines that the optimism</text><text start="762.18" dur="3.899">Foundation sets in the very early stages</text><text start="764.399" dur="3.721">of the optimism Collective and</text><text start="766.079" dur="3.961">eventually that&apos;ll be a scope that is</text><text start="768.12" dur="3.839">set by our governance Community by the</text><text start="770.04" dur="3.9">collaboration between token house and</text><text start="771.959" dur="3.301">the citizens health so we can bookmark</text><text start="773.94" dur="2.76">the kind of rabbit hole of optimism</text><text start="775.26" dur="3.18">governance for a second and just say</text><text start="776.7" dur="4.02">there&apos;s a scope for the funding round</text><text start="778.44" dur="4.74">that&apos;s set at the outset and some time</text><text start="780.72" dur="5.34">passes and maybe in that time people</text><text start="783.18" dur="4.92">put in a lot of effort to build stuff</text><text start="786.06" dur="3.959">that fits in that round scope or in the</text><text start="788.1" dur="3.84">case of this round because it&apos;s been so</text><text start="790.019" dur="3.241">long since round one there&apos;s been tons</text><text start="791.94" dur="2.579">of positive contributions that have</text><text start="793.26" dur="3.54">happened over the past year so we</text><text start="794.519" dur="3.721">basically said here&apos;s the round scope we</text><text start="796.8" dur="2.76">know there&apos;s tons of stuff that fits in</text><text start="798.24" dur="2.64">here so we&apos;re going to move right</text><text start="799.56" dur="2.219">through the next couple stages of the</text><text start="800.88" dur="3.72">process</text><text start="801.779" dur="6.24">next stage is this nomination window so</text><text start="804.6" dur="4.679">anybody on uh uh on the planet Earth or</text><text start="808.019" dur="3.601">beyond the planet Earth anybody can</text><text start="809.279" dur="4.081">nominate a project for funding and so</text><text start="811.62" dur="3.719">the way you nominate a project is you</text><text start="813.36" dur="3.3">read the scope and you&apos;re like hey this</text><text start="815.339" dur="3.721">opens there&apos;s dependency that I use</text><text start="816.66" dur="4.08">every day probably fits within that</text><text start="819.06" dur="3.66">scope or hey I read this educational</text><text start="820.74" dur="4.02">resource about optimism and I realize</text><text start="822.72" dur="4.26">there&apos;s this education category so I&apos;m</text><text start="824.76" dur="3.84">going to nominate that thing we&apos;ve got a</text><text start="826.98" dur="3.18">couple threads open on our governance</text><text start="828.6" dur="4.14">forum and that&apos;s where anyone can show</text><text start="830.16" dur="5.7">up and write a pretty short description</text><text start="832.74" dur="5.039">to nominate the project for funding</text><text start="835.86" dur="4.5">um the scope of this round two I should</text><text start="837.779" dur="4.56">add is funding public goods that support</text><text start="840.36" dur="3.719">the development and the usage of the op</text><text start="842.339" dur="3.841">stack and so we&apos;re starting with this</text><text start="844.079" dur="4.38">pretty small concentric Circle to say</text><text start="846.18" dur="4.62">all of the things that we rely on to</text><text start="848.459" dur="3.901">make optimism go should be funded and</text><text start="850.8" dur="3.36">that includes the infra and the</text><text start="852.36" dur="3.96">dependencies that the optimism code base</text><text start="854.16" dur="4.799">itself relies on that includes the</text><text start="856.32" dur="4.5">tooling and utilities that developers on</text><text start="858.959" dur="3.541">the optimism core development team or</text><text start="860.82" dur="3.84">building applications in the optimism</text><text start="862.5" dur="5.22">ecosystem use and that includes</text><text start="864.66" dur="5.34">education things that bring awareness of</text><text start="867.72" dur="3.84">optimism to a broader audience whether</text><text start="870.0" dur="4.019">that&apos;s technical education or social</text><text start="871.56" dur="4.079">education Etc</text><text start="874.019" dur="3.541">um so in any of those categories you can</text><text start="875.639" dur="3.541">nominate something and that nomination</text><text start="877.56" dur="4.079">window at least for this round will run</text><text start="879.18" dur="4.26">two weeks ending on January 31st</text><text start="881.639" dur="3.481">we do a little bit of like program</text><text start="883.44" dur="3.6">management admin to make sure we&apos;ve got</text><text start="885.12" dur="3.18">info from all of those projects which is</text><text start="887.04" dur="2.76">pretty important right we want to make</text><text start="888.3" dur="3.719">sure we&apos;re funding the right people and</text><text start="889.8" dur="3.719">everyone feels safe and good about that</text><text start="892.019" dur="3.241">we also collect a little bit of</text><text start="893.519" dur="2.94">information from them and we&apos;ll probably</text><text start="895.26" dur="2.879">come back to this in a second but</text><text start="896.459" dur="2.88">there&apos;s a there&apos;s a big variable here</text><text start="898.139" dur="3.661">around</text><text start="899.339" dur="5.401">what info we require from the project</text><text start="901.8" dur="5.219">and what info we present to voters when</text><text start="904.74" dur="3.659">they&apos;re making their choice so we&apos;ve got</text><text start="907.019" dur="2.76">all these products nominated we&apos;ve kind</text><text start="908.399" dur="2.341">of collected some information we&apos;ve got</text><text start="909.779" dur="3.18">a pretty</text><text start="910.74" dur="3.06">um consistent template for everybody and</text><text start="912.959" dur="3.841">then</text><text start="913.8" dur="5.88">we enter this voting window so voting on</text><text start="916.8" dur="5.7">retro pgf is done by a set of people who</text><text start="919.68" dur="5.219">are called citizens so optimism has two</text><text start="922.5" dur="5.16">houses of governance token house which</text><text start="924.899" dur="5.461">is standard token weighted voting so the</text><text start="927.66" dur="4.02">op token circulates freely and people</text><text start="930.36" dur="4.44">who</text><text start="931.68" dur="4.74">have OB tokens delegated to them can</text><text start="934.8" dur="3.96">choose to vote in the token house</text><text start="936.42" dur="4.5">governance and they&apos;re responsible for a</text><text start="938.76" dur="6.06">set of decisions around grants funding</text><text start="940.92" dur="5.94">and uh governing certain attributes of</text><text start="944.82" dur="4.079">how the sequencer works and approving</text><text start="946.86" dur="3.719">protocol upgrades things like that</text><text start="948.899" dur="3.0">second house of optimism governance is</text><text start="950.579" dur="3.421">called the citizens house and their</text><text start="951.899" dur="3.901">primary responsibility is voting on</text><text start="954.0" dur="4.8">retro pgf it&apos;s voting on the allocation</text><text start="955.8" dur="5.64">of public goods funding so we are</text><text start="958.8" dur="4.38">gradually ramping up this concept of the</text><text start="961.44" dur="3.78">citizens house and in retro pgf round</text><text start="963.18" dur="3.599">two we&apos;ve got about 90 people who are</text><text start="965.22" dur="4.32">from all different backgrounds and</text><text start="966.779" dur="5.581">experiences who will be voting on how to</text><text start="969.54" dur="6.479">allocate 10 million op tokens over the</text><text start="972.36" dur="4.919">full set of projects that were nominated</text><text start="976.019" dur="3.361">um so we covered a lot of ground and</text><text start="977.279" dur="3.661">there&apos;s a lot of uh a lot of detail in</text><text start="979.38" dur="3.66">there but that&apos;s the very basic like run</text><text start="980.94" dur="4.5">of show of of how we go start to finish</text><text start="983.04" dur="3.599">after the voting takes place</text><text start="985.44" dur="3.06">um funding&apos;s distributed to those</text><text start="986.639" dur="4.621">projects then we&apos;ll run retro pgf round</text><text start="988.5" dur="5.04">three with a new scope maybe it&apos;s</text><text start="991.26" dur="4.74">broader maybe it&apos;s more specific a</text><text start="993.54" dur="4.62">slightly broader set of citizens</text><text start="996.0" dur="3.839">um and keep going until we&apos;ve</text><text start="998.16" dur="3.419">funded all of the impact on the world</text><text start="999.839" dur="3.721">and brought everybody into the new fold</text><text start="1001.579" dur="3.841">of how this economy should work right</text><text start="1003.56" dur="3.779">well I just think it&apos;s so elegant how</text><text start="1005.42" dur="3.06">with optimism&apos;s bicameral governance</text><text start="1007.339" dur="3.36">structure you&apos;ve got the token house</text><text start="1008.48" dur="3.599">which is like motivated by capital and</text><text start="1010.699" dur="3.241">then you&apos;ve got the citizens house which</text><text start="1012.079" dur="3.421">is kind of motivated by these values and</text><text start="1013.94" dur="3.42">you&apos;re kind of creating this economic</text><text start="1015.5" dur="3.0">system that</text><text start="1017.36" dur="3.539">um</text><text start="1018.5" dur="4.56">the the sum is greater than than each of</text><text start="1020.899" dur="3.66">those parts they&apos;re they&apos;re they&apos;re kind</text><text start="1023.06" dur="2.94">of really very</text><text start="1024.559" dur="3.541">um there&apos;s a healthy tension there but</text><text start="1026.0" dur="5.16">but I think that together it makes the</text><text start="1028.1" dur="4.8">the community stronger and so um the</text><text start="1031.16" dur="3.24">bicameral governance is something that</text><text start="1032.9" dur="3.48">vitalik has talked about as a big</text><text start="1034.4" dur="5.279">innovation to make sure that capital is</text><text start="1036.38" dur="4.679">values aligned and that values uh the</text><text start="1039.679" dur="3.301">values alignment has the power of</text><text start="1041.059" dur="3.36">capital and wow 10 million op tokens</text><text start="1042.98" dur="3.719">that&apos;s like 20 million bucks right 21</text><text start="1044.419" dur="5.221">million dollars as of as a recording</text><text start="1046.699" dur="5.461">it&apos;s a it&apos;s a big chunk of tokens and if</text><text start="1049.64" dur="3.96">you look at the initial allocation of</text><text start="1052.16" dur="2.879">um like the initial tokens applied</text><text start="1053.6" dur="3.12">there&apos;s a huge portion of it that&apos;s</text><text start="1055.039" dur="3.901">allocated for retroactive public goods</text><text start="1056.72" dur="4.319">funding in addition to a portion of</text><text start="1058.94" dur="3.599">protocol Revenue that will go to public</text><text start="1061.039" dur="4.081">goods funding</text><text start="1062.539" dur="6.541">um and so we really care about this not</text><text start="1065.12" dur="5.28">only as a as a new type of economy that</text><text start="1069.08" dur="3.3">we want to prove out but also because</text><text start="1070.4" dur="4.2">it&apos;s a it&apos;s a growth strategy we</text><text start="1072.38" dur="4.679">earnestly believe that funding public</text><text start="1074.6" dur="4.86">goods will make optimism an incredibly</text><text start="1077.059" dur="4.801">vibrant and successful crypto ecosystem</text><text start="1079.46" dur="4.44">because it&apos;ll be easier to build on it</text><text start="1081.86" dur="4.199">will be easier to learn about it will be</text><text start="1083.9" dur="5.17">easier to participate in as a technical</text><text start="1086.059" dur="3.301">or non-technical person it&apos;s like</text><text start="1089.07" dur="1.43">[Music]</text><text start="1089.36" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="1090.5" dur="4.08">it&apos;s not just altruism like yes we think</text><text start="1093.08" dur="3.18">it&apos;s good for it&apos;s the way the world</text><text start="1094.58" dur="4.5">should work but we also think it&apos;s a</text><text start="1096.26" dur="5.58">really crucial ingredient to to Growing</text><text start="1099.08" dur="5.52">this this fabric community</text><text start="1101.84" dur="4.199">yeah I love that alignment of I mean</text><text start="1104.6" dur="3.9">this is what makes optimism such a</text><text start="1106.039" dur="4.441">special place uh to me</text><text start="1108.5" dur="4.32">um in in the ecosystem and such a leader</text><text start="1110.48" dur="4.5">is that it&apos;s got the values alignment of</text><text start="1112.82" dur="4.32">being focused on public goods and it&apos;s</text><text start="1114.98" dur="3.84">also got the capital to deploy on this</text><text start="1117.14" dur="3.96">stuff uh and one without the other</text><text start="1118.82" dur="4.56">doesn&apos;t have the same sort of effect but</text><text start="1121.1" dur="4.56">the synthesis of the two is is what</text><text start="1123.38" dur="4.5">makes it pretty exciting to me for sure</text><text start="1125.66" dur="4.2">yeah and I&apos;m glad you brought up some of</text><text start="1127.88" dur="4.32">vitalik&apos;s writing because I think one of</text><text start="1129.86" dur="4.559">the just like personally one of the most</text><text start="1132.2" dur="5.28">interesting things about working on this</text><text start="1134.419" dur="5.101">project is that space between some of</text><text start="1137.48" dur="4.199">the abstract ideas around how these</text><text start="1139.52" dur="5.22">systems could work like ethers Phoenix</text><text start="1141.679" dur="4.561">or a bicameral governance system where</text><text start="1144.74" dur="3.179">certain governance rights are

dur="5.88">so it&apos;s like all right retrophgf that&apos;s</text><text start="1177.74" dur="4.08">a pretty clean concept but when you</text><text start="1180.26" dur="4.38">break it down and try to like make it</text><text start="1181.82" dur="4.44">actionable and execute on it it&apos;s really</text><text start="1184.64" dur="2.84">messy and there are a thousand little</text><text start="1186.26" dur="4.5">variables</text><text start="1187.48" dur="6.579">from the product design of the UI to the</text><text start="1190.76" dur="5.159">way we distribute voting badges to the</text><text start="1194.059" dur="4.561">specific algorithm we&apos;re using to count</text><text start="1195.919" dur="4.201">votes to the way that we word the scope</text><text start="1198.62" dur="5.1">there&apos;s so many variables that actually</text><text start="1200.12" dur="5.1">affect the outcomes and uh it&apos;s just</text><text start="1203.72" dur="4.38">like a joy to kind of work through that</text><text start="1205.22" dur="4.199">and iterate towards the actual outcomes</text><text start="1208.1" dur="3.12">that we&apos;re that we&apos;re working on I think</text><text start="1209.419" dur="4.081">there&apos;s so much fascinating stuff in</text><text start="1211.22" dur="4.319">there that it&apos;s um been really fun to to</text><text start="1213.5" dur="4.26">play with that optimism</text><text start="1215.539" dur="3.601">yeah oh man we could go we could dive in</text><text start="1217.76" dur="3.659">on those variables but we could also</text><text start="1219.14" dur="4.02">look well maybe I&apos;ll establish I want to</text><text start="1221.419" dur="3.0">establish like a macro View and then</text><text start="1223.16" dur="2.46">maybe we can dive in on some of those</text><text start="1224.419" dur="2.581">variables</text><text start="1225.62" dur="4.02">um so</text><text start="1227.0" dur="4.7">I&apos;ve kind of got this view of</text><text start="1229.64" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="1231.799" dur="3.601">a holonic view of how we&apos;re going to</text><text start="1233.6" dur="4.199">fund public goods using crypto in the</text><text start="1235.4" dur="5.94">future and like a whole lot is just a</text><text start="1237.799" dur="5.581">whole that&apos;s comprised of Parts like</text><text start="1241.34" dur="3.959">um I I am a whole lot of my cells and my</text><text start="1243.38" dur="3.299">organs and me and you together are a</text><text start="1245.299" dur="3.481">whole lot of this episode of the podcast</text><text start="1246.679" dur="3.601">in the ethereum community is a whole lot</text><text start="1248.78" dur="3.3">that&apos;s composed of the ethereum</text><text start="1250.28" dur="4.92">community and</text><text start="1252.08" dur="4.68">um inside of each hold on uh in order to</text><text start="1255.2" dur="3.12">fund the public goods of that whole on</text><text start="1256.76" dur="3.96">in this case the ethereum community or</text><text start="1258.32" dur="4.2">the optimism Community you need</text><text start="1260.72" dur="3.18">um funding</text><text start="1262.52" dur="2.7">but then once you have the funding the</text><text start="1263.9" dur="3.24">question is how do I distribute it to</text><text start="1265.22" dur="3.6">the most legitimate public goods and so</text><text start="1267.14" dur="4.919">you&apos;ve got the mechanism is the other</text><text start="1268.82" dur="4.979">composite part of the whole on and so</text><text start="1272.059" dur="3.601">um in gitcoin&apos;s case the funding source</text><text start="1273.799" dur="4.921">is really generous</text><text start="1275.66" dur="4.379">um donors optimism included that give to</text><text start="1278.72" dur="2.579">get coin and then you have quadratic</text><text start="1280.039" dur="2.64">funding as the mechanism that</text><text start="1281.299" dur="3.721">distributes it&apos;s the most legitimate</text><text start="1282.679" dur="4.081">public goods and then within optimism</text><text start="1285.02" dur="3.3">you&apos;ve got sequencer fees and the</text><text start="1286.76" dur="3.48">initial token allocation as the funding</text><text start="1288.32" dur="3.239">mechanism and then you&apos;ve got or sorry</text><text start="1290.24" dur="3.059">the funding source and then the</text><text start="1291.559" dur="3.12">mechanism is retroactive public goods</text><text start="1293.299" dur="3.24">funding</text><text start="1294.679" dur="3.301">um and and I think some sort of</text><text start="1296.539" dur="5.161">quadratic voting correct me if I&apos;m wrong</text><text start="1297.98" dur="5.76">uh it will take place there we&apos;re</text><text start="1301.7" dur="4.44">actually not using quadratic voting this</text><text start="1303.74" dur="3.96">in round two as sort of a test to see</text><text start="1306.14" dur="3.24">how it affects the voting outcomes but</text><text start="1307.7" dur="2.82">yes right I like that that distinction</text><text start="1309.38" dur="3.84">right the funding comes from somewhere</text><text start="1310.52" dur="4.74">and then there&apos;s a decision there&apos;s like</text><text start="1313.22" dur="4.02">this like decision module where funding</text><text start="1315.26" dur="3.659">has to get distributed well yeah and</text><text start="1317.24" dur="4.08">then like the last thing to build on top</text><text start="1318.919" dur="3.481">of that is like you start with funding</text><text start="1321.32" dur="2.64">the public goods of the optimism</text><text start="1322.4" dur="4.139">community and then you can fund the</text><text start="1323.96" dur="4.44">ethereum uh like I almost look at this</text><text start="1326.539" dur="3.781">as like an expanding the whole on of</text><text start="1328.4" dur="4.44">which public goods were funding so you</text><text start="1330.32" dur="4.44">start with optimism community and then</text><text start="1332.84" dur="3.6">you since optimism kind of is ethereum</text><text start="1334.76" dur="3.6">then you expand out to ethereum public</text><text start="1336.44" dur="3.479">goods and then we could go to all open</text><text start="1338.36" dur="3.78">source software and we&apos;re creating this</text><text start="1339.919" dur="4.081">ethers Phoenix retroactive public goods</text><text start="1342.14" dur="4.56">funding loop at expanding</text><text start="1344.0" dur="4.559">expanding amounts of humanity and then</text><text start="1346.7" dur="4.08">you eventually do from all open source</text><text start="1348.559" dur="3.721">then all digital and then and then you</text><text start="1350.78" dur="3.66">can kind of retroactive public goods</text><text start="1352.28" dur="4.86">fund the world out from there and that&apos;s</text><text start="1354.44" dur="4.92">like the incremental iterative approach</text><text start="1357.14" dur="4.2">the loop that I would like to see happen</text><text start="1359.36" dur="3.72">in the world and and one of the things I</text><text start="1361.34" dur="3.3">think is cool is like this modularity of</text><text start="1363.08" dur="3.719">like oh there&apos;s going to be a pluralism</text><text start="1364.64" dur="3.899">of mechanisms and funding sources that&apos;s</text><text start="1366.799" dur="3.301">going to allow that to expand outwards</text><text start="1368.539" dur="3.961">and that&apos;s what makes kind of like</text><text start="1370.1" dur="3.9">bitcoin&apos;s work and optimism&apos;s work uh</text><text start="1372.5" dur="2.58">complementary you know in a way and</text><text start="1374.0" dur="2.7">there&apos;ll be certain mechanisms that are</text><text start="1375.08" dur="2.459">really good for some communities</text><text start="1376.7" dur="3.24">um but won&apos;t be good for other</text><text start="1377.539" dur="4.5">communities and so that forkability</text><text start="1379.94" dur="3.66">um of like that allocation stack I think</text><text start="1382.039" dur="3.541">is really important so I don&apos;t know</text><text start="1383.6" dur="4.02">that&apos;s that&apos;s my macro take on on how</text><text start="1385.58" dur="4.5">retroactive public goods funding and</text><text start="1387.62" dur="4.14">other mechanisms expand out to like</text><text start="1390.08" dur="2.94">really create outcomes for Humanity but</text><text start="1391.76" dur="4.799">I&apos;m curious how that resonates with the</text><text start="1393.02" dur="6.84">optimism vision 100 yeah that&apos;s exactly</text><text start="1396.559" dur="6.0">the the dream is like running this</text><text start="1399.86" dur="6.66">process enough until we can build the</text><text start="1402.559" dur="5.941">escape Velocity to expand beyond our own</text><text start="1406.52" dur="4.08">optimism Community beyond our own</text><text start="1408.5" dur="4.26">ethereum Community Beyond even the the</text><text start="1410.6" dur="4.439">crypto community and I think it&apos;s this</text><text start="1412.76" dur="5.1">balance between like these incredibly</text><text start="1415.039" dur="5.76">large dreams and then the humility to</text><text start="1417.86" dur="5.699">know that we can&apos;t like take one giant</text><text start="1420.799" dur="4.38">step and say right optimism is able to</text><text start="1423.559" dur="3.541">fund public goods across the entire</text><text start="1425.179" dur="4.561">Globe we&apos;re doing it all right now it&apos;s</text><text start="1427.1" dur="3.78">like we know that it&apos;s possible but we</text><text start="1429.74" dur="3.6">know we have to take a lot of small</text><text start="1430.88" dur="3.84">steps to get there and that&apos;s sort of</text><text start="1433.34" dur="3.36">what I mean about all these infinite</text><text start="1434.72" dur="4.439">variables like there&apos;s a lot of ways I</text><text start="1436.7" dur="5.099">think we could design a bad round and</text><text start="1439.159" dur="4.621">and I think we&apos;re very clear-eyed that</text><text start="1441.799" dur="3.421">even in round two there&apos;s probably going</text><text start="1443.78" dur="2.94">to be a lot of constructive feedback</text><text start="1445.22" dur="3.24">from projects who are getting funded</text><text start="1446.72" dur="3.78">from voters from community members</text><text start="1448.46" dur="3.24">making nominations where they say hey</text><text start="1450.5" dur="3.539">these things work for me and these</text><text start="1451.7" dur="4.2">things didn&apos;t work for me and by giving</text><text start="1454.039" dur="3.781">ourselves little bite-sized chunks we</text><text start="1455.9" dur="5.399">like I think dramatically increase the</text><text start="1457.82" dur="5.339">chances that we arrive at a process in</text><text start="1461.299" dur="3.24">the longer term that actually works for</text><text start="1463.159" dur="3.121">the impact that it&apos;s trying to fund</text><text start="1464.539" dur="4.321">because who knows it will learn even</text><text start="1466.28" dur="4.86">when we grow from a scope that says</text><text start="1468.86" dur="4.679">we&apos;re funding public goods that support</text><text start="1471.14" dur="4.56">development of ethereum and optimism or</text><text start="1473.539" dur="4.62">we&apos;re funding public goods for the Thai</text><text start="1475.7" dur="5.219">crypto Community we&apos;ve got a giant Thai</text><text start="1478.159" dur="4.02">Community out there like the scope of</text><text start="1480.919" dur="2.701">the funding round will change the</text><text start="1482.179" dur="4.38">mechanics of the round the makeup of</text><text start="1483.62" dur="5.05">badge holders will change it and trying</text><text start="1486.559" dur="2.881">to remain very</text><text start="1488.67" dur="1.61">[Music]</text><text start="1489.44" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="1490.28" dur="4.86">like pragmatic that we don&apos;t know all of</text><text start="1493.58" dur="4.2">the right answers for all of those</text><text start="1495.14" dur="5.34">different uh different steps yeah I mean</text><text start="1497.78" dur="4.259">I think the iterative approach is a is a</text><text start="1500.48" dur="4.26">great one you know they say startups are</text><text start="1502.039" dur="4.441">kind of like contained explosions</text><text start="1504.74" dur="3.36">um and maybe like each of each I know</text><text start="1506.48" dur="3.72">like get coin round is just like an</text><text start="1508.1" dur="4.38">experiment with a new mechanism or a new</text><text start="1510.2" dur="5.459">parameter and then you iterate towards</text><text start="1512.48" dur="6.36">the global Maxima of coordination</text><text start="1515.659" dur="4.38">um it through just trying stuff and and</text><text start="1518.84" dur="3.3">you got to get it wrong in the</text><text start="1520.039" dur="3.901">iterations in order to in order to learn</text><text start="1522.14" dur="3.659">and so</text><text start="1523.94" dur="3.359">um yeah that iterative Loop is is really</text><text start="1525.799" dur="3.0">I think very cool for proving this out</text><text start="1527.299" dur="3.601">but what what makes me really excited</text><text start="1528.799" dur="4.681">about this vision is that if it works in</text><text start="1530.9" dur="6.48">optimism then you can imagine</text><text start="1533.48" dur="5.46">um other l2s or defy or Dow projects</text><text start="1537.38" dur="3.84">doing</text><text start="1538.94" dur="4.2">um retroactive public goods funding</text><text start="1541.22" dur="4.319">um or maybe you know we reach a place in</text><text start="1543.14" dur="5.76">which crypto is saturated</text><text start="1545.539" dur="5.101">um the world and you know a local a</text><text start="1548.9" dur="3.659">local community uh could just take the</text><text start="1550.64" dur="3.18">Playbook that optimism uses to fund its</text><text start="1552.559" dur="3.12">public goods and it could fund its</text><text start="1553.82" dur="3.18">public goods using that exact same stack</text><text start="1555.679" dur="3.181">and play like it&apos;s forkable and open</text><text start="1557.0" dur="3.6">source right so all you need is like a</text><text start="1558.86" dur="3.12">concerned citizen that can Fork the</text><text start="1560.6" dur="3.66">mechanism and implement it in their own</text><text start="1561.98" dur="4.38">Community for this to like you know it&apos;s</text><text start="1564.26" dur="4.38">like a dandelion that&apos;s like the sort of</text><text start="1566.36" dur="4.679">like the seed spread from there that&apos;s</text><text start="1568.64" dur="4.019">an excellent excellent image I think</text><text start="1571.039" dur="3.181">that&apos;s super true and I&apos;m interested to</text><text start="1572.659" dur="4.38">see how it takes off I mean I think</text><text start="1574.22" dur="4.62">Bitcoin has played a huge role in that</text><text start="1577.039" dur="3.601">dandelion effect and in spreading this</text><text start="1578.84" dur="4.26">way of thinking and</text><text start="1580.64" dur="4.74">um helping people digest the meme that</text><text start="1583.1" dur="3.78">crypto and really all technology is</text><text start="1585.38" dur="4.56">built on open source and that there&apos;s</text><text start="1586.88" dur="5.22">this obligation not only like a kind of</text><text start="1589.94" dur="3.839">just obligation but also is like an</text><text start="1592.1" dur="4.439">effective way to make sure things are</text><text start="1593.779" dur="4.921">safe and usable to to continue to fund</text><text start="1596.539" dur="3.481">public goods and so I don&apos;t know two is</text><text start="1598.7" dur="2.7">stronger than one and five is stronger</text><text start="1600.02" dur="4.38">than two and so we&apos;ll see how how far</text><text start="1601.4" dur="4.019">the dandelion goes yeah well um you know</text><text start="1604.4" dur="3.24">like thank you for saying that about</text><text start="1605.419" dur="3.421">getcoin I just want to share a little</text><text start="1607.64" dur="2.519">story</text><text start="1608.84" dur="2.88">um and that&apos;s the in the heart of the</text><text start="1610.159" dur="4.02">last bear Market</text><text start="1611.72" dur="4.14">um when eth was at eighty dollars uh get</text><text start="1614.179" dur="3.24">coin was</text><text start="1615.86" dur="3.24">figuring out what it wanted to be</text><text start="1617.419" dur="2.701">wandering around in the abyss trying to</text><text start="1619.1" dur="2.699">figure out what we wanted to do when we</text><text start="1620.12" dur="3.9">grow up and we got on a call with Carl</text><text start="1621.799" dur="4.74">and Jing from the optimism team then it</text><text start="1624.02" dur="5.46">was called uh plasma group I think</text><text start="1626.539" dur="5.341">um and and they donated 100K they were</text><text start="1629.48" dur="4.5">our first uh donors to get coin that</text><text start="1631.88" dur="3.84">wasn&apos;t the ethereum foundation and they</text><text start="1633.98" dur="3.96">told us we really love what you&apos;re doing</text><text start="1635.72" dur="4.559">with public goods and we have I think it</text><text start="1637.94" dur="4.68">was like 95k left in this entity and we</text><text start="1640.279" dur="3.601">want to donate it to the public good and</text><text start="1642.62" dur="3.24">keep up the great work and it was like</text><text start="1643.88" dur="4.62">for me it was like a warm fuzzy because</text><text start="1645.86" dur="4.14">I I like an application Level developer</text><text start="1648.5" dur="3.179">but Carl and Jaeger like deep Game</text><text start="1650.0" dur="5.279">Theory like protocol developers just</text><text start="1651.679" dur="6.12">like I don&apos;t know it it anyway so um it</text><text start="1655.279" dur="3.9">feels like optimism or uh Carl and Jing</text><text start="1657.799" dur="3.24">could sort of like slingshot get coin</text><text start="1659.179" dur="3.6">through the last bear Market</text><text start="1661.039" dur="3.721">um and I and I hope that Bitcoin can pay</text><text start="1662.779" dur="4.081">it forward to you because</text><text start="1664.76" dur="4.799">um optimism in many ways is carrying the</text><text start="1666.86" dur="4.679">torch on on public goods funding</text><text start="1669.559" dur="3.301">um and now we&apos;ve got a pluralism of</text><text start="1671.539" dur="3.0">public goods funding mechanisms and</text><text start="1672.86" dur="3.559">funding sources and that&apos;s that&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="1674.539" dur="4.38">cool like that&apos;s client diversity City</text><text start="1676.419" dur="3.88">but for public goods funding sources and</text><text start="1678.919" dur="3.841">I think that that&apos;s really exciting to</text><text start="1680.299" dur="5.701">me that&apos;s all said</text><text start="1682.76" dur="6.24">um yeah I I have had some back and forth</text><text start="1686.0" dur="4.919">with folks on the Bitcoin Grand sub team</text><text start="1689.0" dur="4.799">folks like Chase</text><text start="1690.919" dur="6.181">um and others Michelle Etc</text><text start="1693.799" dur="5.581">um and I have kind of gotten bit by this</text><text start="1697.1" dur="3.78">by this hype that y&apos;all are building and</text><text start="1699.38" dur="4.14">building out sort of this Central</text><text start="1700.88" dur="5.279">repository for uh if you&apos;ll permit me a</text><text start="1703.52" dur="4.259">moment of showing uh Bitcoin

dur="3.601">I think we can meme it into existence</text><text start="1792.38" dur="3.899">and I&apos;m glad you brought up that kind of</text><text start="1794.0" dur="4.74">uh that concept of upfront

dur="3.959">as you mentioned this pluralism of other</text><text start="1815.899" dur="5.041">folks funding public goods to think to</text><text start="1818.179" dur="4.86">uh increase the kind of

dur="3.541">function increase in the success of this</text><text start="1826.399" dur="4.441">system where if we can build a community</text><text start="1828.08" dur="5.459">of investors who

was</text><text start="1847.46" dur="2.579">explaining to him all the reasons why</text><text start="1848.6" dur="3.84">retractive public goods funding was</text><text start="1850.039" dur="3.901">gonna change the way investors think</text><text start="1852.44" dur="3.18">about retroactive public goods funding</text><text start="1853.94" dur="3.78">he&apos;s like dude you can explain it to me</text><text start="1855.62" dur="4.02">but like when the first exit happens</text><text start="1857.72" dur="3.6">then that&apos;s when all the capitals gonna</text><text start="1859.64" dur="3.779">like go after and chase us and we need</text><text start="1861.32" dur="3.9">that visceral like totally you know that</text><text start="1863.419" dur="3.0">visceral first exit and then that&apos;ll</text><text start="1865.22" dur="2.88">change the game</text><text start="1866.419" dur="3.661">totally and that&apos;s what I mean by like</text><text start="1868.1" dur="3.78">the you know the the like gnarly</text><text start="1870.08" dur="3.479">implementation details right the concept</text><text start="1871.88" dur="3.419">is super clean but to get there it&apos;s</text><text start="1873.559" dur="4.261">like all right well we need to increase</text><text start="1875.299" dur="4.561">confidence by funding this many public</text><text start="1877.82" dur="3.78">goods over this many rounds we need to</text><text start="1879.86" dur="3.9">figure out the right investment</text><text start="1881.6" dur="4.439">structure like is there a hyper cert</text><text start="1883.76" dur="4.019">involved here are we pulling together</text><text start="1886.039" dur="4.38">the right community so that people can</text><text start="1887.779" dur="4.861">mean each other into participation in</text><text start="1890.419" dur="5.221">the system there&apos;s a lot of like</text><text start="1892.64" dur="5.34">um both social and Technical questions</text><text start="1895.64" dur="3.72">that have to be answered even with a</text><text start="1897.98" dur="3.299">hypothesis even if it&apos;s not the final</text><text start="1899.36"

that</text><text start="1904.76" dur="4.019">I really want to camp on</text><text start="1907.34" dur="2.579">because you know I believe in this in</text><text start="1908.779" dur="2.64">this like outer loop but you know</text><text start="1909.919" dur="3.901">clearly I&apos;m green pilled I&apos;m like</text><text start="1911.419" dur="4.14">episode 100 of these but like for for</text><text start="1913.82" dur="3.3">the people who aren&apos;t green pill yet and</text><text start="1915.559" dur="3.301">like they tune out the public good stuff</text><text start="1917.12" dur="4.2">as just like this hippie dippy granola</text><text start="1918.86" dur="4.26">uh coming out of Boulder Colorado</text><text start="1921.32" dur="3.42">Kevin&apos;s talking about public goods thing</text><text start="1923.12" dur="4.2">again I just want to camp on the fact</text><text start="1924.74" dur="4.679">that you said that it&apos;s about public</text><text start="1927.32" dur="3.959">goods but it&apos;s also a growth hack for</text><text start="1929.419" dur="4.801">the optimism ecosystem so the same</text><text start="1931.279" dur="6.061">mechanism pointed at</text><text start="1934.22" dur="5.22">um optimism as a growth hack is a</text><text start="1937.34" dur="4.5">mechanism for public goods funding in</text><text start="1939.44" dur="4.8">The Wider world just when you apply it</text><text start="1941.84" dur="4.8">at a different aperture and and to me</text><text start="1944.24" dur="3.84">you know optimism wanting to grow its</text><text start="1946.64" dur="2.94">developer Community is not that</text><text start="1948.08" dur="3.8">dissimilar from like a local town like</text><text start="1949.58" dur="4.979">Boulder wanting to grow its community of</text><text start="1951.88" dur="6.46">engaged citizens who are like I don&apos;t</text><text start="1954.559" dur="5.22">know making a downtown livable and</text><text start="1958.34" dur="4.439">um making sure that you know you could</text><text start="1959.779" dur="5.461">point that same mechanism at uh open</text><text start="1962.779" dur="6.361">source software and build public goods</text><text start="1965.24" dur="5.34">for like the npm python ecosystem and so</text><text start="1969.14" dur="2.759">to me that&apos;s what makes me insanely</text><text start="1970.58" dur="2.94">bullish that we&apos;re going to get to this</text><text start="1971.899" dur="4.14">point where we&apos;re going to have this</text><text start="1973.52" dur="3.899">public goods exit thing is because</text><text start="1976.039" dur="3.481">um in the meantime you can just sell</text><text start="1977.419" dur="3.181">this stuff to marketing departments that</text><text start="1979.52" dur="4.5">are trying to build their crypto</text><text start="1980.6" dur="6.12">ecosystems or to like local governments</text><text start="1984.02" dur="4.86">you know I&apos;m painting over a few details</text><text start="1986.72" dur="3.059">here but but I just want to make I guess</text><text start="1988.88" dur="2.34">the point I&apos;m trying to make is that</text><text start="1989.779" dur="2.701">this isn&apos;t just like a moral argument</text><text start="1991.22" dur="2.699">that like public goods are good and we</text><text start="1992.48" dur="3.24">should fund them because people who</text><text start="1993.919" dur="4.441">contribute to public goods are good it&apos;s</text><text start="1995.72" dur="5.04">actually like the business objectives of</text><text start="1998.36" dur="4.199">a lot of crypto can use these mechanisms</text><text start="2000.76" dur="3.36">to build their ecosystems public goods</text><text start="2002.559" dur="3.301">and I think that that&apos;s that&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="2004.12" dur="4.14">going to bridge us to this point where</text><text start="2005.86" dur="3.179">public goods are just like ubiquitous I</text><text start="2008.26" dur="1.5">don&apos;t know if you have any comments on</text><text start="2009.039" dur="2.64">that</text><text start="2009.76" dur="4.919">yeah I think that&apos;s a really important</text><text start="2011.679" dur="5.521">point and if if we even if we put crypto</text><text start="2014.679" dur="3.84">aside for a moment so way back in the</text><text start="2017.2" dur="2.76">day I worked at metamask which is this</text><text start="2018.519" dur="3.78">open source project and it got me</text><text start="2019.96" dur="4.74">interested in</text><text start="2022.299" dur="4.081">um the just the mechanics of building in</text><text start="2024.7" dur="3.18">public right you&apos;ve got people screaming</text><text start="2026.38" dur="4.86">your issues you&apos;ve also got people who</text><text start="2027.88" dur="4.56">pick up you know uh half-built thing and</text><text start="2031.24" dur="3.0">get it over the finish line and there&apos;s</text><text start="2032.44" dur="3.9">just like all these Dynamics and making</text><text start="2034.24" dur="3.6">that possible and from there I went to</text><text start="2036.34" dur="3.78">work at GitHub where</text><text start="2037.84" dur="4.199">almost all of the world a lot of the</text><text start="2040.12" dur="3.299">world&apos;s open source software lives and I</text><text start="2042.039" dur="3.841">worked on the team that is thinking</text><text start="2043.419" dur="4.46">about how to make the production and</text><text start="2045.88" dur="4.62">maintenance of Open Source software</text><text start="2047.879" dur="3.881">accessible and for lack of better word</text><text start="2050.5" dur="4.2">healthy and so that includes things like</text><text start="2051.76" dur="4.8">GitHub sponsors GitHub discussions</text><text start="2054.7" dur="3.24">um like onboarding even onto GitHub</text><text start="2056.56" dur="2.579">things like that</text><text start="2057.94" dur="2.76">um and there&apos;s an incredible team there</text><text start="2059.139" dur="3.301">but we spent a lot of time thinking</text><text start="2060.7" dur="4.56">about the</text><text start="2062.44" dur="6.719">psychology behind people who contribute</text><text start="2065.26" dur="6.919">to open source software projects and I</text><text start="2069.159" dur="6.72">am consistently</text><text start="2072.179" dur="7.18">shocked that the modern world exists as</text><text start="2075.879" dur="5.341">it does today given the current state of</text><text start="2079.359" dur="4.56">Open Source development and funding</text><text start="2081.22" dur="4.879">because every single piece of software</text><text start="2083.919" dur="5.641">that you touch in your daily life has</text><text start="2086.099" dur="6.221">thousands of Legos that are built for</text><text start="2089.56" dur="4.039">free that are maintained for free and</text><text start="2092.32" dur="4.019">that the software that you&apos;re using</text><text start="2093.599" dur="5.681">critically depends on to work</text><text start="2096.339" dur="5.101">and there is this like massive economic</text><text start="2099.28" dur="3.72">mismatch and sometimes that thing bites</text><text start="2101.44" dur="3.78">Us in the ass right there&apos;s I don&apos;t know</text><text start="2103.0" dur="4.08">heart bleed or like the event stream</text><text start="2105.22" dur="3.899">hack that I guess is somewhat crypto</text><text start="2107.08" dur="4.98">related but the fact that that thing</text><text start="2109.119" dur="6.361">that type of thing where a free piece of</text><text start="2112.06" dur="5.46">software where the maintainer has has no</text><text start="2115.48" dur="4.68">economic incentive to maintain it and</text><text start="2117.52" dur="4.26">keep it safe other than well no economic</text><text start="2120.16" dur="4.14">incentive and probably a lot of personal</text><text start="2121.78" dur="4.62">incentives like Pride or the sense of</text><text start="2124.3" dur="4.14">giving back the fact that that type of</text><text start="2126.4" dur="4.38">thing doesn&apos;t crumble much more often</text><text start="2128.44" dur="5.179">and bring down huge parts of our modern</text><text start="2130.78" dur="5.16">economy with it is</text><text start="2133.619" dur="6.161">continuously surprising to me and</text><text start="2135.94" dur="5.88">frankly a little terrifying and so</text><text start="2139.78" dur="4.02">yes we&apos;re talking about funding public</text><text start="2141.82" dur="4.38">goods as a growth strategy for optimism</text><text start="2143.8" dur="5.94">but I also think funding public goods</text><text start="2146.2" dur="6.3">like open source software is pretty</text><text start="2149.74" dur="5.4">critical for our modern worlds to</text><text start="2152.5" dur="5.94">continue to survive in the way that it</text><text start="2155.14" dur="5.4">does now and that&apos;s why we&apos;re really</text><text start="2158.44" dur="4.919">that&apos;s why I&apos;m personally really keen on</text><text start="2160.54" dur="6.24">this idea extending Beyond just optimism</text><text start="2163.359" dur="5.821">and just crypto because</text><text start="2166.78" dur="4.799">I don&apos;t know if the current status quo</text><text start="2169.18" dur="4.02">will be able to continue for so long and</text><text start="2171.579" dur="3.961">we&apos;ve also thought about this with</text><text start="2173.2" dur="5.1">sponsors right there are there are we we</text><text start="2175.54" dur="4.98">started from a place of sponsors</text><text start="2178.3" dur="4.799">gaining traction with companies because</text><text start="2180.52" dur="4.74">they wanted the marketing boost right I</text><text start="2183.099" dur="5.221">as uh</text><text start="2185.26" dur="4.68">gripe a giant payments company want to</text><text start="2188.32" dur="3.6">give 10 million to open source every</text><text start="2189.94" dur="3.899">year because it looks good and that only</text><text start="2191.92" dur="4.919">goes so far right what we really try to</text><text start="2193.839" dur="5.041">do is connect that big budget company</text><text start="2196.839" dur="3.901">it&apos;s like thinking about funding open</text><text start="2198.88" dur="3.479">source software to the actual benefits</text><text start="2200.74" dur="3.3">they would get from funding it so for</text><text start="2202.359" dur="3.601">example if we&apos;re spending 10 million</text><text start="2204.04" dur="3.9">dollars on open source software we know</text><text start="2205.96" dur="3.24">that our stack is safer and we know that</text><text start="2207.94" dur="2.94">the security of those things that we&apos;re</text><text start="2209.2" dur="2.82">depending on is slightly higher than it</text><text start="2210.88" dur="3.239">would be if those projects were</text><text start="2212.02" dur="4.74">underfunded so in general with this</text><text start="2214.119" dur="4.681">whole concept and I promise my ramble is</text><text start="2216.76" dur="3.839">almost through but it&apos;s like</text><text start="2218.8" dur="4.319">helping people understand this stuff</text><text start="2220.599" dur="4.5">isn&apos;t just like you said a hippie dippy</text><text start="2223.119" dur="4.101">abstract like oh this like Community</text><text start="2225.099" dur="5.341">impact should be funded it&apos;s actually</text><text start="2227.22" dur="6.639">we&apos;ve built a house of cards and it&apos;s</text><text

start="2281.859" dur="3.24">the interesting part for me is like how</text><text start="2283.599" dur="3.361">do we go from the game theoretic</text><text start="2285.099" dur="4.101">shelling point

start="2334.599" dur="3.24">exact right question to ask and it&apos;s</text><text start="2336.4" dur="3.0">interesting to for me at least just to</text><text start="2337.839" dur="3.24">compare like optimism&apos;s approach and</text><text start="2339.4" dur="3.54">github&apos;s approach for github&apos;s approach</text><text start="2341.079" dur="4.861">is like somewhat social with sponsors</text><text start="2342.94" dur="4.38">and optimism&apos;s approach bakes I mean I</text><text start="2345.94" dur="2.82">guess it&apos;s still social because some of</text><text start="2347.32" dur="3.44">it exists at the governance layer but</text><text start="2348.76" dur="5.52">we&apos;re baking in</text><text start="2350.76" dur="5.2">this assumption this like this little</text><text start="2354.28" dur="3.839">channel for a portion of protocol</text><text start="2355.96" dur="4.74">profits to continually forever and ever</text><text start="2358.119"

dur="4.32">and the more sort of like long-term</text><text start="2371.02" dur="5.099">interests of the citizens to decide how</text><text start="2373.3" dur="5.22">that funding is like how much and how</text><text start="2376.119" dur="4.321">that funding is distributed but it&apos;s a</text><text start="2378.52" dur="3.42">slightly more opinionated take it&apos;s like</text><text start="2380.44" dur="4.139">that thing exists as part of the system</text><text start="2381.94" dur="4.139">it&apos;s not just like an agreement that</text><text start="2384.579" dur="3.78">we&apos;re trying to strike with a bunch of</text><text start="2386.079" dur="5.941">business people</text><text start="2388.359" dur="5.461">so we&apos;ll see if it works yeah totally</text><text start="2392.02" dur="3.18">um well you know I also appreciate that</text><text start="2393.82" dur="3.0">you&apos;ve left the crypto bubble you worked</text><text start="2395.2" dur="4.139">at metamask and and then you went to</text><text start="2396.82" dur="4.98">GitHub sponsors and it almost feels like</text><text start="2399.339" dur="4.861">your role uh at optimism Foundation is</text><text start="2401.8" dur="3.72">is combining what you learned in both of</text><text start="2404.2" dur="3.6">those places in order to create this</text><text start="2405.52" dur="3.9">like coordination Megazord so</text><text start="2407.8" dur="3.059">um you know I appreciate that reality</text><text start="2409.42" dur="3.3">check as well</text><text start="2410.859" dur="3.061">for sure yeah I missed I missed the</text><text start="2412.72" dur="3.66">crypto and I had to come back but</text><text start="2413.92" dur="5.82">honestly I think it was the</text><text start="2416.38" dur="6.6">the specific vision of the folks at</text><text start="2419.74" dur="4.68">optimism and the like magnitude of what</text><text start="2422.98" dur="3.18">they&apos;re trying to accomplish that feels</text><text start="2424.42" dur="3.9">like that little Beating Heart at the</text><text start="2426.16" dur="4.26">core of crypto that&apos;s what I care about</text><text start="2428.32" dur="4.56">this movement for and we&apos;ve accumulated</text><text start="2430.42" dur="4.38">this much larger troop and there&apos;s like</text><text start="2432.88" dur="3.84">you know some chaos and some things that</text><text start="2434.8" dur="3.42">I like kind of look away from and some</text><text start="2436.72" dur="3.66">like you know some people doing really</text><text start="2438.22" dur="3.66">brilliant novel stuff and I think at the</text><text start="2440.38" dur="3.42">core there&apos;s this group of folks with</text><text start="2441.88" dur="4.979">very strong values about how crypto can</text><text start="2443.8" dur="4.559">actually make the world better and give</text><text start="2446.859" dur="3.421">us different tools to coordinate with</text><text start="2448.359" dur="3.421">that can solve all sorts of problems and</text><text start="2450.28" dur="4.68">that&apos;s like I think</text><text start="2451.78" dur="4.319">um the the subset of the broader</text><text start="2454.96" dur="2.82">community that I that I love to play in</text><text start="2456.099" dur="3.301">and that&apos;s what pulled me back</text><text start="2457.78" dur="2.94">and one of the things that I got to say</text><text start="2459.4" dur="2.52">like going back to my point about like</text><text start="2460.72" dur="2.7">how do we make the game theoretic</text><text start="2461.92" dur="2.699">shelling point to coordinate not to</text><text start="2463.42" dur="4.14">defect and to support your</text><text start="2464.619" dur="5.46">infrastructure but um you know I also</text><text start="2467.56" dur="4.92">and like to the eye to this idea that</text><text start="2470.079" dur="3.721">VCS will actually fund the public goods</text><text start="2472.48" dur="2.7">when they see there&apos;s an exit from</text><text start="2473.8" dur="2.58">public goods</text><text start="2475.18" dur="4.56">um I just want to say that I think the</text><text start="2476.38" dur="4.68">optimism is is really special in turning</text><text start="2479.74" dur="2.46">the tide towards a more regenerative</text><text start="2481.06" dur="3.539">crypto economic internet because it&apos;s</text><text start="2482.2" dur="5.28">proof point I mean the L2 is a leading</text><text start="2484.599" dur="4.621">L2 uh the technology is sound and the</text><text start="2487.48" dur="4.2">ethos the fact that it&apos;s bundled with</text><text start="2489.22" dur="4.139">this ethos hopefully will be a part of</text><text start="2491.68" dur="3.12">that creation of this game theoretic</text><text start="2493.359" dur="3.121">shelling Point towards more public goods</text><text start="2494.8" dur="3.779">and like what I really want in the next</text><text start="2496.48" dur="4.32">Market cycle is for the Vanguard</text><text start="2498.579" dur="4.981">projects to not be this like dog [ __ ]</text><text start="2500.8" dur="5.039">like the safe moons in the like I didn&apos;t</text><text start="2503.56" dur="4.08">even know the names of like of of these</text><text start="2505.839" dur="3.301">like meme coins that just pump and dump</text><text start="2507.64" dur="3.9">because</text><text start="2509.14" dur="3.84">if we can&apos;t like the the subtitle of the</text><text start="2511.54" dur="3.66">green pill podcast or the book is like</text><text start="2512.98" dur="3.599">how crypto can regenerate the world and</text><text start="2515.2" dur="3.3">I want</text><text start="2516.579" dur="3.54">it to be crypto actually is regenerating</text><text start="2518.5" dur="3.839">the world in the next Edition that we do</text><text start="2520.119" dur="4.261">and we don&apos;t get that without projects</text><text start="2522.339" dur="3.78">that are actually truly eating their</text><text start="2524.38" dur="3.18">decentralization in their region</text><text start="2526.119" dur="4.081">vegetables doing it and I think that</text><text start="2527.56" dur="4.62">optimism is sort of like leading</text><text start="2530.2" dur="3.419">um in in that way and you know hopefully</text><text start="2532.18" dur="2.939">we move from a market that&apos;s all just</text><text start="2533.619" dur="2.701">speculation to one that&apos;s more</text><text start="2535.119" dur="2.281">fundamentals and I think that projects</text><text start="2536.32" dur="3.18">like optimism really have strong</text><text start="2537.4" dur="3.78">fundamentals so uh just a recognition</text><text start="2539.5" dur="4.02">for you all that you&apos;re that you&apos;re sort</text><text start="2541.18" dur="5.76">of leading in improving that a more</text><text start="2543.52" dur="5.4">regen green pilled web3 is possible and</text><text start="2546.94" dur="4.26">uh I don&apos;t know what your secret is but</text><text start="2548.92" dur="5.159">uh but I but I hope that you sprinkle</text><text start="2551.2" dur="4.74">some some optimism and some retro PDF</text><text start="2554.079" dur="3.54">and in public goods on on the rest of</text><text start="2555.94" dur="3.26">the ecosystem before the next Market</text><text start="2557.619" dur="4.441">cycle starts</text><text start="2559.2" dur="4.96">I appreciate that I think we have a long</text><text start="2562.06" dur="3.72">ways to go and a lot of work to do but I</text><text start="2564.16" dur="3.179">appreciate that nonetheless yeah well</text><text start="2565.78" dur="3.42">I&apos;m like the tired curmudgeon after 15</text><text start="2567.339" dur="3.361">rounds of Bitcoin grants we&apos;re like</text><text start="2569.2" dur="5.28">passing the batana they&apos;re like yeah</text><text start="2570.7" dur="6.06">good luck with your next 13 Rounds Bobby</text><text start="2574.48" dur="3.78">um so I want to spend maybe a few more</text><text start="2576.76" dur="2.579">minutes talking high level about this</text><text start="2578.26" dur="2.7">world that you&apos;re trying to create and</text><text start="2579.339" dur="4.381">then we should probably stick The</text><text start="2580.96" dur="4.98">Landing by by tangibly revisiting retro</text><text start="2583.72" dur="4.02">pgf round two so is there anything that</text><text start="2585.94" dur="4.86">I didn&apos;t ask you that that you want to</text><text start="2587.74" dur="4.8">say about retro pgf or optimism or the</text><text start="2590.8" dur="4.2">movement that y&apos;all are building</text><text start="2592.54" dur="4.559">hmm I mean there&apos;s a lot that I could</text><text start="2595.0" dur="3.359">say I think that the the piece that we</text><text start="2597.099" dur="4.081">touched on a tiny bit that I just want</text><text start="2598.359" dur="5.041">to reiterate is like the commitment to</text><text start="2601.18" dur="3.899">um this being this gradual iterative</text><text start="2603.4" dur="3.78">process because I think oftentimes</text><text start="2605.079" dur="6.061">there&apos;s a little bit of distance between</text><text start="2607.18" dur="6.12">what people expect and how kind of</text><text start="2611.14" dur="5.82">progressive we&apos;re being with this so a</text><text start="2613.3" dur="6.36">lot of projects have gone right from uh</text><text start="2616.96" dur="5.34">or Dev team building something to like</text><text start="2619.66" dur="5.52">full Dao and there&apos;s a like just that</text><text start="2622.3" dur="4.62">leap in a moment and there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2625.18" dur="3.3">benefits to that right you just like hit</text><text start="2626.92" dur="4.32">that end State and you figure stuff out</text><text start="2628.48" dur="4.2">live but what optimism is trying to do</text><text start="2631.24" dur="4.8">is this much more gradual process</text><text start="2632.68" dur="5.22">because we know how hard the design of</text><text start="2636.04" dur="3.12">these systems can be and how much there</text><text start="2637.9" dur="3.36">is to get right if we&apos;re going to build</text><text start="2639.16" dur="4.32">something that actually works for a huge</text><text start="2641.26" dur="4.68">variety of stakeholders and participants</text><text start="2643.48" dur="3.54">and so we I&apos;ve had this experience</text><text start="2645.94" dur="3.24">talking with a bunch of different</text><text start="2647.02" dur="3.839">community members where they expect</text><text start="2649.18" dur="3.3">things to be a certain way or they</text><text start="2650.859" dur="3.601">expect these certain types of decisions</text><text start="2652.48" dur="5.94">to be immediately you know voted on by</text><text start="2654.46" dur="6.3">everybody or they expect like</text><text start="2658.42" dur="4.199">um I don&apos;t know if like oh you&apos;re</text><text start="2660.76" dur="4.319">funding public goods like why aren&apos;t we</text><text start="2662.619" dur="3.541">funding teachers in my hometown why</text><text start="2665.079" dur="3.78">aren&apos;t we funding clean water</text><text start="2666.16" dur="5.04">immediately like this type of uh get</text><text start="2668.859" dur="3.96">there tomorrow sort of mentality</text><text start="2671.2" dur="2.7">it would be ideal if those things were</text><text start="2672.819" dur="3.54">possible but we&apos;re just like really</text><text start="2673.9" dur="4.199">committed to taking it step by step and</text><text start="2676.359" dur="2.941">committed to being here for the Long</text><text start="2678.099" dur="4.141">Haul</text><text start="2679.3" dur="4.5">um and like we I certainly hope that</text><text start="2682.24" dur="4.68">folks hold us accountable to that</text><text start="2683.8" dur="4.86">commitment that each step we are taking</text><text start="2686.92" dur="3.72">feedback and making the system work</text><text start="2688.66" dur="3.72">better and we&apos;re learning from past</text><text start="2690.64" dur="3.42">experiences</text><text start="2692.38" dur="3.42">um but just I think it&apos;s a slightly</text><text start="2694.06" dur="4.14">different way of doing things than a lot</text><text start="2695.8" dur="3.66">of um existing projects out there have</text><text start="2698.2" dur="3.72">have</text><text start="2699.46" dur="4.08">taken and so I just wanted to like I</text><text start="2701.92" dur="4.02">guess touch on that again because it&apos;ll</text><text start="2703.54" dur="5.1">it&apos;ll take a while but I think it&apos;s the</text><text start="2705.94" dur="5.399">most likely path to lead us to a to a</text><text start="2708.64" dur="4.979">good system at the end of the rainbow</text><text start="2711.339" dur="3.78">the end of the rainbow</text><text start="2713.619" dur="2.761">um yeah I mean in my my version of this</text><text start="2715.119" dur="3.301">is like you can&apos;t let perfect be the</text><text start="2716.38" dur="4.32">enemy of good we wish quadratic funding</text><text start="2718.42" dur="5.1">was was funding local public goods and</text><text start="2720.7" dur="4.44">things outside of the crypto bubble but</text><text start="2723.52" dur="3.299">um you know we just rewrote the entire</text><text start="2725.14" dur="2.88">not we but get coined out it just</text><text start="2726.819" dur="2.641">rewrote the entire stack to be</text><text start="2728.02" dur="2.7">decentralized and modular from a</text><text start="2729.46" dur="4.44">centralized monolith and that took like</text><text start="2730.72" dur="4.5">12 months so it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s actually uh</text><text start="2733.9" dur="3.179">rebuilding the infrastructure that can</text><text start="2735.22" dur="3.96">scale in that way and I gotta say that I</text><text start="2737.079" dur="4.921">think op stack wasn&apos;t was an inspiration</text><text start="2739.18" dur="5.22">for Grant stack um you have this modular</text><text start="2742.0" dur="3.54">ecosystem that can be used to compose an</text><text start="2744.4" dur="2.76">L2</text><text start="2745.54" dur="3.42">um and so you went like one level meta</text><text start="2747.16" dur="3.78">above just building an L2 with the op</text><text start="2748.96" dur="3.24">stack and I think that get coin from</text><text start="2750.94" dur="2.46">what I&apos;ve seen of their strategy on the</text><text start="2752.2" dur="3.3">governance forums is like the same thing</text><text start="2753.4" dur="4.38">it&apos;s like building a suite of tools that</text><text start="2755.5" dur="5.04">can be used to compose a grants program</text><text start="2757.78" dur="5.579">and you can Fork out uh the sequencer in</text><text start="2760.54" dur="4.2">L2 uh for another type of sequencer or</text><text start="2763.359" dur="3.421">on Grant stack you can Fork out</text><text start="2764.74" dur="3.359">quadratic funding for quadratic voting</text><text start="2766.78" dur="3.12">or I don&apos;t know maybe one day we&apos;ll</text><text start="2768.099" dur="3.061">build retroactive public goods funding</text><text start="2769.9" dur="2.52">into grant stack or something like that</text><text start="2771.16" dur="2.939">and so</text><text start="2772.42" dur="3.06">um you all have been an inspiration I I</text><text start="2774.099" dur="3.301">think for Bitcoin as it&apos;s turned the</text><text start="2775.48" dur="3.78">corner from centralized monolith into</text><text start="2777.4" dur="3.66">decentralized modular and then you just</text><text start="2779.26" dur="4.26">have to iterate from there once you&apos;ve</text><text start="2781.06" dur="4.86">got the right foundation and so</text><text start="2783.52" dur="4.799">um yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s pretty exciting for me</text><text start="2785.92" dur="4.74">to see it working at op stack and it</text><text start="2788.319" dur="3.841">gives me hope that uh the grand stack</text><text start="2790.66" dur="3.54">will work in the same with the same sort</text><text start="2792.16"

dur="3.06">experiment with a chain that has</text><text start="2819.579" dur="4.201">different characteristics I think is</text><text start="2820.96" dur="4.2">like very core to our open

dur="4.079">that other people can take it and remix</text><text start="2828.76" dur="3.42">it and play with it and reassemble it in</text><text start="2830.619" dur="3.0">a way that works for them</text><text start="2832.18" dur="2.76">um but it also exactly like you</text><text start="2833.619" dur="3.24">mentioned applies to a lot of other</text><text start="2834.94" dur="4.52">different

great</text><text start="2924.76" dur="4.859">stream of nominations coming in so far</text><text start="2926.5" dur="4.8">but I think the broader the set of folks</text><text start="2929.619" dur="4.821">who are nominating I think the better</text><text start="2931.3" dur="5.76">the outcomes will be so you can head to</text><text start="2934.44" dur="4.06">gov.optimism.io and there are a couple</text><text start="2937.06" dur="2.82">threads going on there where folks have</text><text start="2938.5" dur="3.96">been nominating projects over the past</text><text start="2939.88" dur="4.56">couple weeks and that nomination window</text><text start="2942.46" dur="4.02">will wrap up at the end of January on</text><text start="2944.44" dur="4.02">January 31st so</text><text

February kind of getting our</text><text start="2952.06" dur="5.34">acts together for this voting period and</text><text start="2955.24" dur="3.42">um I&apos;m honestly really excited not only</text><text start="2957.4" dur="2.939">for the products getting funded but also</text><text start="2958.66" dur="3.48">for the Retro experience of this round</text><text start="2960.339" dur="3.721">because that&apos;s what kind of propels us</text><text start="2962.14" dur="3.479">for round three so at the conclusion of</text><text start="2964.06" dur="3.9">round two we&apos;ll be announcing plans for</text><text start="2965.619" dur="4.081">round three and that&apos;s another exciting</text><text start="2967.96" dur="3.359">moment to get involved as we announced</text><text start="2969.7" dur="3.18">Let&apos;s Go you can kind of consider is</text><text start="2971.319" dur="3.961">there something I can do that fits</text><text start="2972.88" dur="4.32">within this kind of spec this umbrella</text><text start="2975.28" dur="4.079">of impact and then there&apos;ll be a period</text><text start="2977.2" dur="4.02">of time between round three announcement</text><text start="2979.359" dur="4.26">and round three voting where you can</text><text start="2981.22" dur="3.78">find some folks to build with get in</text><text start="2983.619" dur="4.2">contact with the optimism team and our</text><text start="2985.0" dur="5.099">deveral folks and um it kind of paired</text><text start="2987.819" dur="4.201">with uh the the right way to make impact</text><text start="2990.099" dur="3.781">um there&apos;s a lot of good stuff coming in</text><text start="2992.02" dur="4.26">for round three as well</text><text start="2993.88" dur="4.8">yeah excited for that um and will those</text><text start="2996.28" dur="3.96">links to to those uh resources will be</text><text start="2998.68" dur="2.82">in the show notes</text><text start="3000.24" dur="2.64">um are you all planning on doing this I</text><text start="3001.5" dur="2.76">think round one to round two was roughly</text><text start="3002.88" dur="3.6">nine months or 12 months are you</text><text start="3004.26" dur="3.66">planning on doing yearly or quarterly or</text><text start="3006.48" dur="3.48">you know what&apos;s what&apos;s the Cadence are</text><text start="3007.92" dur="4.439">you all just kind of figuring it out</text><text start="3009.96" dur="4.98">very much want to increase the Cadence</text><text start="3012.359" dur="4.201">so ideally there&apos;s not nearly as much of</text><text start="3014.94" dur="3.659">a time delay between round one and round</text><text start="3016.56" dur="4.2">two we&apos;ve had a very busy year so I</text><text start="3018.599" dur="4.02">think that contributed to it as well but</text><text start="3020.76" dur="3.12">um like we mentioned with the way to get</text><text start="3022.619" dur="3.601">some of this investment off the ground</text><text start="3023.88" dur="4.32">running retro PDF regularly I think is</text><text start="3026.22" dur="4.2">going to be key to its success so you&apos;ll</text><text start="3028.2" dur="3.899">likely see the Cadence of rounds</text><text start="3030.42" dur="3.899">um shorten we could even run parallel</text><text start="3032.099" dur="4.26">rounds in some future universe so</text><text start="3034.319" dur="4.321">um we want to make this ongoing process</text><text start="3036.359" dur="5.281">and really build up the muscle so that</text><text start="3038.64" dur="4.8">this can get super easy for our side and</text><text start="3041.64" dur="4.02">from the community side as well</text><text start="3043.44" dur="3.6">and then let&apos;s just end on what does</text><text start="3045.66" dur="4.199">this look like if you all are maximally</text><text start="3047.04" dur="4.62">successful uh my version of this is like</text><text start="3049.859" dur="3.361">it&apos;s a world where VCS fund public goods</text><text start="3051.66" dur="2.939">the same way they do seed stage startups</text><text start="3053.22" dur="2.879">but like what does the world look like</text><text start="3054.599" dur="3.861">where you where you stick the landing on</text><text start="3056.099" dur="4.801">this I don&apos;t know let&apos;s say 20</text><text start="3058.46" dur="5.08">27 or something like that</text><text start="3060.9" dur="4.919">so what you mentioned I think is a goal</text><text start="3063.54" dur="4.2">post along our our vision for success</text><text start="3065.819" dur="3.54">but it&apos;s not the end State I think the</text><text start="3067.74" dur="4.92">end state is that</text><text start="3069.359" dur="5.301">the the global economy or the many</text><text start="3072.66" dur="6.06">different versions of the global economy</text><text start="3074.66" dur="7.36">have built in a mechanism that funds</text><text start="3078.72" dur="4.44">public goods that is not just taxes</text><text start="3082.02" dur="3.0">funding</text><text start="3083.16" dur="3.36">schools are doing the kind of like</text><text start="3085.02" dur="3.0">marginal things that at least I see</text><text start="3086.52" dur="2.76">happen in the United States maybe</text><text start="3088.02" dur="3.36">marginal&apos;s too strong a word I know</text><text start="3089.28" dur="3.66">there&apos;s tons of government funding that</text><text start="3091.38" dur="4.26">goes towards</text><text start="3092.94" dur="5.28">um supporting public goods but the</text><text start="3095.64" dur="5.58">global economy takes note and starts to</text><text start="3098.22" dur="6.18">fund public goods in a way where the</text><text start="3101.22" dur="5.7">profit to the individual is actually</text><text start="3104.4" dur="4.26">matching the impact that that public</text><text start="3106.92" dur="4.38">good has provided and that is something</text><text start="3108.66" dur="4.86">that I think is very easy to observe us</text><text start="3111.3" dur="4.44">not doing today if you think about the</text><text start="3113.52" dur="4.319">amount of social science research that</text><text start="3115.74" dur="3.599">shows that education is one of the most</text><text start="3117.839" dur="3.181">important things for driving positive</text><text start="3119.339" dur="3.841">life outcomes and then you look at the</text><text start="3121.02" dur="3.96">average public school teacher salary in</text><text start="3123.18" dur="3.78">the U.S and I think it&apos;s pretty easy to</text><text start="3124.98" dur="4.379">see a clear mismatch between the impact</text><text start="3126.96" dur="3.659">a good school teacher is providing and</text><text start="3129.359" dur="4.26">the amount of profit they&apos;re personally</text><text start="3130.619" dur="5.46">receiving is as part of it so maximally</text><text start="3133.619" dur="3.901">successful to me looks like a global</text><text start="3136.079" dur="4.621">economy that takes note from what</text><text start="3137.52" dur="4.98">optimism is doing and funds public goods</text><text start="3140.7" dur="4.08">in a way that matches the impact they&apos;re</text><text start="3142.5" dur="3.24">having and isn&apos;t just a footnote on a</text><text start="3144.78" dur="3.42">budget</text><text start="3145.74" dur="3.839">yeah I I think that like for me what</text><text start="3148.2" dur="3.359">makes me really bullish is like these</text><text start="3149.579" dur="4.381">individual agent level incentives that</text><text start="3151.559" dur="4.401">exist in that world where</text><text start="3153.96" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="3156.359" dur="4.801">where people can work on the public good</text><text start="3158.28" dur="4.92">and and just like be financially</text><text start="3161.16" dur="3.959">rewarded for it and then what you get is</text><text start="3163.2" dur="3.119">this like game theoretic shelling</text><text start="3165.119" dur="3.601">pointer like movement from people</text><text start="3166.319" dur="4.621">working at like JP Morgan so that they</text><text start="3168.72" dur="3.24">have to like be so they can pay the</text><text start="3170.94" dur="3.06">mortgage and pay for their kids</text><text start="3171.96" dur="4.2">education and health care and stuff to</text><text start="3174.0" dur="3.48">just working on public goods</text><text start="3176.16" dur="2.82">um and you know the problem with like</text><text start="3177.48" dur="4.02">you know spending nine hours a day</text><text start="3178.98" dur="4.32">working at a big bank is that by the end</text><text start="3181.5" dur="3.42">of your the end of that you don&apos;t have</text><text start="3183.3" dur="3.24">any time left in your day you don&apos;t have</text><text start="3184.92" dur="4.139">any energy emotional energy to go fix</text><text start="3186.54" dur="4.98">the potholes or to go pitching in your</text><text start="3189.059" dur="4.201">community and so by pointing people&apos;s</text><text start="3191.52" dur="5.22">Financial lives at public goods instead</text><text start="3193.26" dur="5.16">of these like private uh privatized jobs</text><text start="3196.74" dur="3.48">um then then not only do you like create</text><text start="3198.42" dur="3.36">a better world</text><text start="3200.22" dur="3.06">um because all the world&apos;s agents are</text><text start="3201.78" dur="3.18">like working on public goods instead of</text><text start="3203.28" dur="2.88">in their own like private capture things</text><text start="3204.96" dur="3.3">but</text><text start="3206.16" dur="5.22">um but like it just it just really</text><text start="3208.26" dur="5.819">creates a sea change in how people view</text><text start="3211.38" dur="4.679">um being a community Citizen and being</text><text start="3214.079" dur="4.5">able to be a community Citizen and pay</text><text start="3216.059" dur="4.8">your bills with that to me is uh is is</text><text start="3218.579" dur="3.841">really the bullet case for this so I&apos;m</text><text start="3220.859" dur="3.421">so excited about what you&apos;re doing and I</text><text start="3222.42" dur="3.6">hope that get coin and super modular and</text><text start="3224.28" dur="3.96">optimism are are building this world</text><text start="3226.02" dur="3.539">together because uh it feels like one</text><text start="3228.24" dur="3.0">that I want to live in</text><text start="3229.559" dur="3.121">absolutely I appreciate you saying all</text><text start="3231.24" dur="2.94">that I have one little I have one little</text><text start="3232.68" dur="3.24">tiny story people permit me at the end</text><text start="3234.18" dur="3.0">let&apos;s do it yeah one of the questions</text><text start="3235.92" dur="2.82">that you sent over was just like the</text><text start="3237.18" dur="4.439">concept of how do you keep that how do</text><text start="3238.74" dur="4.68">you keep that optimism alive and um you</text><text start="3241.619" dur="3.361">work at a company named optimism well</text><text start="3243.42" dur="2.699">that&apos;s part of it that gets most of the</text><text start="3244.98" dur="2.579">way but it does actually get you all the</text><text start="3246.119" dur="3.661">way so the trick for getting the rest of</text><text start="3247.559" dur="4.861">the way is the Greenfield podcast</text><text start="3249.78" dur="4.2">um I I I like have a very bad habit of</text><text start="3252.42" dur="4.199">biting my nails and so for the past</text><text start="3253.98" dur="4.2">years so I&apos;ve been getting gel manicures</text><text start="3256.619" dur="3.601">where they put this stuff on your nails</text><text
