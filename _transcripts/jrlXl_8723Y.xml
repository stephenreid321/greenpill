dur="5.821">uh yeah so</text><text start="202.379" dur="7.621">um so my name is Yancy strickler I&apos;m one</text><text start="205.92" dur="6.66">of six co-founders of meta label</text><text start="210.0" dur="6.659">meta labels a a project that began a</text><text start="212.58" dur="7.26">year ago and was really born out of a</text><text start="216.659" dur="6.961">pain I felt as a what I came to realize</text><text start="219.84" dur="5.22">was a lonely Creator trapped in the</text><text start="223.62" dur="3.72">Creator economy</text><text start="225.06" dur="4.86">where I was</text><text start="227.34" dur="4.979">um leading a community</text><text start="229.92" dur="5.28">had had written a book I was like doing</text><text start="232.319" dur="5.101">doing all the hustles and uh</text><text start="235.2" dur="6.36">but really felt isolated alone in this</text><text start="237.42" dur="6.179">experience and I ended up</text><text start="241.56" dur="4.98">my my original background is in music</text><text start="243.599" dur="5.401">and I ended up thinking about how a lot</text><text start="246.54" dur="3.3">of indie record labels work and how they</text><text start="249.0" dur="2.939">are</text><text start="249.84" dur="4.92">effectively groups of people who just</text><text start="251.939" dur="5.401">all care about the same genre or idea</text><text start="254.76" dur="5.039">and they&apos;re collaborating to release</text><text start="257.34" dur="5.579">work together they&apos;re releasing work by</text><text start="259.799" dur="5.281">others they&apos;re like every time Discord</text><text start="262.919" dur="4.741">records would put out a new Punk record</text><text start="265.08" dur="3.42">it&apos;s like manifesting more punkness in</text><text start="267.66" dur="2.22">the world</text><text start="268.5" dur="4.74">and</text><text start="269.88" dur="5.879">I connected that that structure with my</text><text start="273.24" dur="3.6">experience and what I was experiencing</text><text start="275.759" dur="2.281">with a group of people I was</text><text start="276.84" dur="4.32">collaborating with</text><text start="278.04" dur="5.939">and what this has evolved into is is</text><text start="281.16" dur="4.5">meta-label and a meta label like like we</text><text start="283.979" dur="4.381">as a group a meta label is a release</text><text start="285.66" dur="5.46">Club where groups of people who share</text><text start="288.36" dur="5.339">the same interests collaboratively drop</text><text start="291.12" dur="6.359">and support each other&apos;s work</text><text start="293.699" dur="4.921">and so uh Punk record label is a meta</text><text start="297.479" dur="3.421">label it&apos;s a group of people who care</text><text start="298.62" dur="4.139">about Punk releasing work but there are</text><text start="300.9" dur="4.019">a lot of projects that fit this</text><text start="302.759" dur="3.72">structure that we don&apos;t really think of</text><text start="304.919" dur="2.161">as being labels</text><text start="306.479" dur="2.521">um</text><text start="307.08" dur="4.38">like in the web today there&apos;s something</text><text start="309.0" dur="4.74">like Mischief I think is an example of a</text><text start="311.46" dur="4.019">of a meta label and a really evocative</text><text start="313.74" dur="3.54">way right can you say more about</text><text start="315.479" dur="5.22">Mischief just yeah I&apos;m not sure everyone</text><text start="317.28" dur="6.3">knows what it is yeah so mischief.xyz uh</text><text start="320.699" dur="4.921">although not a web 3 project uh but they</text><text start="323.58" dur="6.959">have a drop every two weeks that&apos;s</text><text start="325.62" dur="7.139">always some different absurd comment on</text><text start="330.539" dur="3.781">basically how manipulative capitalism is</text><text start="332.759" dur="3.72">by always being these highly</text><text start="334.32" dur="4.56">manipulative capitalist drops they made</text><text start="336.479" dur="4.44">skateboard shoes with Jimmy Fallon last</text><text start="338.88" dur="5.039">week they they paid people&apos;s medical</text><text start="340.919" dur="4.921">beer bills and sweepstakes and they have</text><text start="343.919" dur="4.321">all these distinct releases that</text><text start="345.84" dur="5.22">ultimately create a kind of a world view</text><text start="348.24" dur="5.7">that if you&apos;re in on the joke you get it</text><text start="351.06" dur="5.82">but I think I think git coin is also an</text><text start="353.94" dur="5.46">example of a meta-label where you all</text><text start="356.88" dur="5.939">are a group of people who are inspired</text><text start="359.4" dur="5.519">by public goods and you produce distinct</text><text start="362.819" dur="4.981">releases whether it&apos;s your funding Grant</text><text start="364.919" dur="6.961">rounds or kernel or shelling point or</text><text start="367.8" dur="5.88">the Dow that are all meant to manifest a</text><text start="371.88" dur="4.2">greater appreciation for public goods in</text><text start="373.68" dur="4.799">the world and so I think that this</text><text start="376.08" dur="5.22">structure where a group of people who</text><text start="378.479" dur="6.241">care about the same aesthetic goal</text><text start="381.3" dur="6.239">cultural goal activist goal uh where</text><text start="384.72" dur="6.72">they can pool resources where they can</text><text start="387.539" dur="7.861">drop work as a group I believe that this</text><text start="391.44" dur="5.879">is a needed piece of infrastructure and</text><text start="395.4" dur="3.66">and it&apos;s something that describes a lot</text><text start="397.319" dur="4.921">of really powerful projects in history</text><text start="399.06" dur="7.74">and I personally have experienced</text><text start="402.24" dur="6.0">going from the lonely Creator who&apos;s just</text><text start="406.8" dur="3.78">like competing with everyone else for</text><text start="408.24" dur="5.94">subscribers in the Creator economy</text><text start="410.58" dur="5.94">to now feeling more like I&apos;m creating a</text><text start="414.18" dur="4.5">multiplayer mode where I&apos;m collaborating</text><text start="416.52" dur="4.799">with five or six other people and</text><text start="418.68" dur="5.1">sometimes a drop is more mind to lead</text><text start="421.319" dur="4.201">and other people are supporting me and</text><text start="423.78" dur="3.9">we talk about how we hold each other&apos;s</text><text start="425.52" dur="3.54">hands during a drop like so because</text><text start="427.68" dur="3.419">those are anxious moments before you</text><text start="429.06" dur="4.02">release something but in other projects</text><text start="431.099" dur="4.5">like a drop meta label is going to do</text><text start="433.08" dur="4.32">this week other people are the lead and</text><text start="435.599" dur="4.5">I get to support them and I get to help</text><text start="437.4" dur="6.06">their vision and so it is a different</text><text start="440.099" dur="6.421">way of working but yet also produces</text><text start="443.46" dur="4.5">shared economic uh structures and a lot</text><text start="446.52" dur="4.26">more so</text><text start="447.96" dur="4.799">I I you know so I I&apos;m exploring</text><text start="450.78" dur="4.919">something that brought me a lot of value</text><text start="452.759" dur="5.761">personally in my life and that we are</text><text start="455.699" dur="4.741">building tools in a world to let other</text><text start="458.52" dur="4.2">people do the same it&apos;s quite beautiful</text><text start="460.44" dur="4.319">so a metal label you said is creativity</text><text start="462.72" dur="3.72">multiplayer mode a model for</text><text start="464.759" dur="4.201">collaboration Collective World building</text><text start="466.44" dur="5.039">and mutual support and I always see this</text><text start="468.96" dur="4.32">as an extension of your past work which</text><text start="471.479" dur="3.421">is as the founder of Kickstarter which</text><text start="473.28" dur="3.84">was kind of fundraising in multiplayer</text><text start="474.9" dur="4.079">mode and cutting out the existing</text><text start="477.12" dur="3.0">structures there do you see it on that</text><text start="478.979" dur="4.801">continuum</text><text start="480.12" dur="4.68">yeah absolutely I mean I think that</text><text start="483.78" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="484.8" dur="5.399">you know Kickstarter created a new piece</text><text start="487.8" dur="5.1">of infrastructure it was a new model for</text><text start="490.199" dur="5.34">how to fund work it was a a new model</text><text start="492.9" dur="6.419">for how the public could be involved in</text><text start="495.539" dur="6.6">a work or could validate a work and</text><text start="499.319" dur="5.28">I mean it&apos;s to this date it&apos;s like six</text><text start="502.139" dur="4.021">billion dollars have flown through to</text><text start="504.599" dur="2.88">creative projects through Kickstarter I</text><text start="506.16" dur="3.68">believe something like that that&apos;s</text><text start="507.479" dur="4.44">amazing</text><text start="509.84" dur="3.939">yeah you probably touched millions of</text><text start="511.919" dur="4.321">lives then the million the lives of</text><text start="513.779" dur="5.94">millions create of creators through that</text><text start="516.24" dur="5.76">quite indirectly but sure they&apos;re very</text><text start="519.719" dur="3.18">very highly indirectly but yes I mean I</text><text start="522.0" dur="2.519">feel</text><text start="522.899" dur="3.481">you know I I definitely look at</text><text start="524.519" dur="4.621">Kickstarter as a model I mean like for</text><text start="526.38" dur="4.86">example there was four years of us going</text><text start="529.14" dur="4.259">around and pitching the idea of what now</text><text start="531.24" dur="3.719">people call crowdfunding</text><text start="533.399" dur="3.06">four years of pitching without anything</text><text start="534.959" dur="3.661">to point to</text><text start="536.459" dur="4.621">and it would take forever to explain</text><text start="538.62" dur="4.8">what crowdfunding was forever to explain</text><text start="541.08" dur="4.5">you know the intricacies of this and</text><text start="543.42" dur="5.52">then when you would show someone a web</text><text start="545.58" dur="5.64">page it took like less than 10 seconds</text><text start="548.94" dur="4.68">people like oh why didn&apos;t you tell me</text><text start="551.22" dur="4.38">and I&apos;m like I was you know we were</text><text start="553.62" dur="3.96">trying we&apos;re trying it&apos;s just some some</text><text start="555.6" dur="5.04">things are either easier to experience</text><text start="557.58" dur="4.68">than explain but but yeah I mean I I see</text><text start="560.64" dur="3.96">Kickstarter as</text><text start="562.26" dur="4.199">no one knew that there needed to be a</text><text start="564.6" dur="3.78">door there and then one appeared and</text><text start="566.459" dur="4.681">that door represented a way for Creative</text><text start="568.38" dur="5.94">people to go straight to their audiences</text><text start="571.14" dur="4.98">to get support and I believe that the</text><text start="574.32" dur="5.16">door that does not exist that is going</text><text start="576.12" dur="5.7">to feel very obvious to people is what</text><text start="579.48" dur="3.66">are simple structures for us to</text><text start="581.82" dur="4.38">collaborate together</text><text start="583.14" dur="6.3">and and the beauty of the way we&apos;re</text><text start="586.2" dur="6.6">building a meta label is you know it is</text><text start="589.44" dur="6.3">a it is an on-chain entity it&apos;s plumbing</text><text start="592.8" dur="6.06">will be on chain but that will have a</text><text start="595.74" dur="5.039">shared treasury where a certain</text><text start="598.86" dur="4.14">percentage every meta label will Design</text><text start="600.779" dur="3.661">their own economic structure but a</text><text start="603.0" dur="3.42">certain percentage of the revenue will</text><text start="604.44" dur="4.56">all return to the metal label treasury</text><text start="606.42" dur="4.859">which can be used to invest in new</text><text start="609.0" dur="4.94">projects or people can withdraw from</text><text start="611.279" dur="5.821">and it becomes growing Capital over time</text><text start="613.94" dur="5.68">and and that this is something that</text><text start="617.1" dur="6.6">can happen just around a specific cause</text><text start="619.62" dur="5.219">if you and I just care about uh solar</text><text start="623.7" dur="2.759">Punk and we&apos;re like all right we&apos;re</text><text start="624.839" dur="3.661">going to make solar Punk Comics together</text><text start="626.459" dur="4.38">at all revenue from solar Punk Comics</text><text start="628.5" dur="4.019">are going to our

start="634.68" dur="3.48">every month to a new solar Punk artist</text><text start="636.779" dur="5.701">because we want more people to</text><text start="638.16" dur="6.96">appreciate that like that becomes not</text><text start="642.48" dur="5.4">um some pie in the sky idea that</text><text start="645.12" dur="4.86">actually becomes a viable business model</text><text start="647.88" dur="4.199">that becomes something that for which</text><text start="649.98" dur="4.799">there is infrastructure for which there</text><text start="652.079" dur="4.38">is tooling and for which there is a term</text><text start="654.779" dur="5.221">um and so we we first announced the</text><text start="656.459" dur="5.101">meta-label concept uh in February like I</text><text start="660.0" dur="2.76">wrote We published this essay I had</text><text start="661.56" dur="3.6">written and been working on for about a</text><text start="662.76" dur="4.44">year thinking about it and you know</text><text start="665.16" dur="4.32">since then we&apos;ve heard from several</text><text start="667.2" dur="4.079">hundred groups riding in being like I</text><text start="669.48" dur="4.14">think you&apos;ve just described what I am</text><text start="671.279" dur="4.8">and I didn&apos;t know I didn&apos;t know what I</text><text start="673.62" dur="4.86">was and I struggled to say what I was</text><text start="676.079" dur="4.741">and you know currently right now we&apos;re</text><text start="678.48" dur="4.799">running a cohort program called assembly</text><text start="680.82" dur="4.32">where we invited groups to apply and we</text><text start="683.279" dur="3.721">picked 39</text><text start="685.14" dur="4.8">um amazing groups all around the world</text><text start="687.0" dur="6.18">half of which I&apos;d say are web 3 half are</text><text start="689.94" dur="5.399">not web at all they&apos;re cultural and</text><text start="693.18" dur="4.2">we&apos;re all together learning how to</text><text start="695.339" dur="4.321">collaborate how to release work how to</text><text start="697.38" dur="4.079">create catalogs having people like</text><text start="699.66" dur="3.48">stolen camp in to talk about how to</text><text start="701.459" dur="3.901">collaborate or Extinction rebellions</text><text start="703.14" dur="3.9">Extinction rebellions and as a cohort in</text><text start="705.36" dur="5.099">a member of the cohort</text><text start="707.04" dur="5.88">and so you know this idea has definitely</text><text start="710.459" dur="4.56">found people for whom this is already</text><text start="712.92" dur="4.44">like a very valuable way of working but</text><text start="715.019" dur="3.901">it&apos;s one that hasn&apos;t fit in</text><text start="717.36" dur="4.08">and</text><text start="718.92" dur="4.74">um and so we think that much like you</text><text start="721.44" dur="4.56">know crowdfunding was a door that needed</text><text start="723.66" dur="4.619">to exist I I very much think the same</text><text start="726.0" dur="3.959">for meta labels and that it&apos;s a it&apos;s</text><text start="728.279" dur="3.3">like a model that&apos;s in between a</text><text start="729.959" dur="3.781">for-profit and a non-profit and it&apos;s</text><text start="731.579" dur="4.32">it&apos;s a model that maximizes for cultural</text><text start="733.74" dur="3.719">impact and that&apos;s what great record</text><text start="735.899" dur="3.0">labels have always been that&apos;s what</text><text start="737.459" dur="2.94">great art galleries have been that&apos;s</text><text start="738.899" dur="3.841">always what great magazines have been</text><text start="740.399" dur="4.201">and they struggle to survive in the</text><text start="742.74" dur="4.32">for-profit context but I believe this is</text><text start="744.6" dur="3.9">a context where they can flourish and</text><text start="747.06" dur="4.44">last</text><text start="748.5" dur="6.66">right so so take me forward</text><text start="751.5" dur="6.06">let&apos;s call it 10 15 years if metal label</text><text start="755.16" dur="3.96">is really successful what will that have</text><text start="757.56" dur="3.779">Unleashed can you paint me a picture of</text><text start="759.12" dur="5.339">that world</text><text start="761.339" dur="6.3">well I think that</text><text start="764.459" dur="4.62">meta-label is a part of a larger series</text><text start="767.639" dur="3.181">of changes</text><text start="769.079" dur="4.801">that</text><text start="770.82" dur="5.459">I I believe that the</text><text start="773.88" dur="4.62">uh that the internet</text><text start="776.279" dur="4.081">this is going to sound like so Boomer</text><text start="778.5" dur="4.579">but I&apos;m gonna build on this uh the</text><text start="780.36" dur="2.719">internet like</text><text start="783.74" dur="4.3">re-individualized us all before the</text><text start="786.12" dur="4.5">internet we our lives are determined by</text><text start="788.04" dur="3.9">where we grew up and who our families</text><text start="790.62" dur="3.62">were and what we looked like to a large</text><text start="791.94" dur="5.459">degree after the internet</text><text start="794.24" dur="5.92">we&apos;ve now had this Infinite Space going</text><text start="797.399" dur="4.74">deeper in this imaginary world of the</text><text start="800.16" dur="3.6">web that is over wrapped and enveloped</text><text start="802.139" dur="3.361">everything and it&apos;s becoming more</text><text start="803.76" dur="4.019">powerful than the physical world that</text><text start="805.5" dur="5.22">gave birth to it in the first place and</text><text start="807.779" dur="5.041">and so on the web we are discovering</text><text start="810.72" dur="4.559">these infinite cells this is a concept I</text><text start="812.82" dur="3.72">call being a post-individual where you</text><text start="815.279" dur="3.481">can create these infinite different</text><text start="816.54" dur="4.62">individualized selves and alts that are</text><text start="818.76" dur="5.639">all real to some degree or not and</text><text start="821.16" dur="5.94">online life is filled with how all those</text><text start="824.399" dur="5.88">alts and people interact with each other</text><text start="827.1" dur="4.859">and what I believe is that in a in an</text><text start="830.279" dur="4.8">individualistic world</text><text start="831.959" dur="4.74">what matters is something like it&apos;s a</text><text start="835.079" dur="4.681">Creator economy thing how many followers</text><text start="836.699" dur="5.041">do I have how many people listen to my</text><text start="839.76" dur="4.079">broadcast is like an individualist way</text><text start="841.74" dur="3.719">of thinking a post-individual is</text><text start="843.839" dur="3.541">thinking way of thinking which is what I</text><text start="845.459" dur="5.041">think the world is moving into it&apos;s more</text><text start="847.38" dur="6.66">like what private chats am I a part of</text><text start="850.5" dur="5.639">what what DMS who&apos;s dming me and who do</text><text start="854.04" dur="4.799">I DM back what is the quality of my</text><text start="856.139" dur="5.041">network to what groups do I belong</text><text start="858.839" dur="5.161">because what you discover is if you look</text><text start="861.18" dur="5.399">back to the moment when humans were</text><text start="864.0" dur="4.32">first individualized there&apos;s two great</text><text start="866.579" dur="4.741">books on this the weirdest people in the</text><text start="868.32" dur="5.639">world by Joseph Heinrich and inventing</text><text start="871.32" dur="5.819">the individual by Larry seidentop</text><text start="873.959" dur="5.281">and they both say point to a moment when</text><text start="877.139" dur="5.401">the Catholic church in about 1000 A.D</text><text start="879.24" dur="4.8">roughly the Catholic Church began to ban</text><text start="882.54" dur="3.299">cousin marriage</text><text start="884.04" dur="3.78">not a phrase you&apos;re expecting to hear on</text><text start="885.839" dur="4.321">the green pillow podcast today</text><text start="887.82" dur="3.959">um but the the church decided to ban</text><text start="890.16" dur="4.02">because of marriage and what happened</text><text start="891.779" dur="4.56">was that until that point families acted</text><text start="894.18" dur="3.779">more like Clans and cousins within</text><text start="896.339" dur="4.201">families would marry each other to</text><text start="897.959" dur="5.401">create more centralized familial Clan</text><text start="900.54" dur="5.82">power and when the church prohibited</text><text start="903.36" dur="4.86">this gradually and then very quickly it</text><text start="906.36" dur="3.479">changed Society because suddenly you the</text><text start="908.22" dur="4.619">young people had to meet people in other</text><text start="909.839" dur="4.8">clans and so there had to be new spaces</text><text start="912.839" dur="3.3">where people could meet each other and</text><text start="914.639" dur="3.841">it was within about a hundred years of</text><text start="916.139" dur="4.981">this happening that the city the</text><text start="918.48" dur="5.64">university the guild and the monastery</text><text start="921.12" dur="5.82">were all invented and so what happened</text><text start="924.12" dur="4.74">when people became individuals they had</text><text start="926.94" dur="4.259">to create new structures that allowed</text><text start="928.86" dur="4.44">them context to</text><text start="931.199" dur="3.541">coordinate to make meaning to do things</text><text start="933.3" dur="3.479">together</text><text start="934.74" dur="5.159">um and so that that&apos;s quickly what they</text><text start="936.779" dur="6.18">discovered and what they did</text><text start="939.899" dur="5.341">the web has similarly re-individualized</text><text start="942.959" dur="4.74">it&apos;s pulled us from our familial context</text><text start="945.24" dur="5.279">in a different kind of way and online</text><text start="947.699" dur="5.64">we&apos;re we&apos;re individuals in in you know</text><text start="950.519" dur="4.5">in a very multiplicitous kind of way and</text><text start="953.339" dur="4.44">I think that what we&apos;re moving to</text><text start="955.019" dur="5.76">towards is a world where</text><text start="957.779" dur="4.8">we are creating the institutions of the</text><text start="960.779" dur="4.141">21st century and the next several</text><text start="962.579" dur="7.5">centuries that are going to be based on</text><text start="964.92" dur="7.44">online kind of first principles that are</text><text start="970.079" dur="4.44">um and in that world</text><text start="972.36" dur="4.02">the groups that we are all members of</text><text start="974.519" dur="4.44">that we can call ourselves members of</text><text start="976.38" dur="4.8">become incredibly meaningful</text><text start="978.959" dur="5.341">and in that world I believe that</text><text start="981.18" dur="5.099">creative people need a kind of a squad</text><text start="984.3" dur="4.26">structure to work together that they</text><text start="986.279" dur="4.62">will similarly need the economic</text><text start="988.56" dur="4.8">resources and the allyship and the</text><text start="990.899" dur="4.68">mutual support that a lot of other forms</text><text start="993.36" dur="3.839">of identity will also create and so in</text><text start="995.579" dur="4.141">that world it&apos;s in that world that I</text><text start="997.199" dur="4.741">think a meta-label or a structure very</text><text start="999.72" dur="3.84">much like it becomes incredibly</text><text start="1001.94" dur="6.36">important because he&apos;s ultimately become</text><text start="1003.56" dur="7.26">new sources of income and solidarity and</text><text start="1008.3" dur="5.58">you know sustainability for their</text><text start="1010.82" dur="5.16">members and and you know so I believe a</text><text start="1013.88" dur="4.079">world where</text><text start="1015.98" dur="4.02">you know right right now labels are seen</text><text start="1017.959" dur="4.141">as elitist but that&apos;s just because there</text><text start="1020.0" dur="3.54">aren&apos;t enough of them I wanna where</text><text start="1022.1" dur="3.78">there&apos;s millions of labels and everyone</text><text start="1023.54" dur="4.44">belongs to multiple communities through</text><text start="1025.88" dur="4.26">which feed them in different ways</text><text start="1027.98" dur="4.68">economic ways creative ways emotional</text><text start="1030.14" dur="5.1">ways and and that&apos;s what I think that&apos;s</text><text start="1032.66" dur="4.919">what where I think we&apos;re going and and</text><text start="1035.24" dur="5.099">so I would say like</text><text start="1037.579" dur="5.34">Dows and meta labels I think they&apos;re</text><text start="1040.339" dur="4.561">more the smoke than the fire</text><text start="1042.919" dur="5.04">and the fire is the way that the</text><text start="1044.9" dur="4.2">internet continues to change society and</text><text start="1047.959" dur="3.121">we are</text><text start="1049.1" dur="5.0">you know moving along through those</text><text start="1051.08" dur="5.459">changes with eyes semi-open that&apos;s where</text><text start="1054.1" dur="5.68">colliding colliding and trying to make</text><text start="1056.539" dur="5.52">it yeah so so it sounds like the meta</text><text start="1059.78" dur="4.38">label is part of a broader context in</text><text start="1062.059" dur="4.021">which the the internet it has</text><text start="1064.16" dur="2.94">re-individualized ourselves and and now</text><text start="1066.08" dur="4.92">we&apos;re kind of like talking about a</text><text start="1067.1" dur="6.36">post-individualist uh Squad that is</text><text start="1071.0" dur="4.14">creating together and this actually</text><text start="1073.46" dur="3.66">feels like a great segue into talking</text><text start="1075.14" dur="4.68">really briefly for The Listener about</text><text start="1077.12" dur="5.22">the concept of bentoism which I first</text><text start="1079.82" dur="4.08">read about when I read your book uh this</text><text start="1082.34" dur="3.18">this can be our future this could be our</text><text start="1083.9" dur="4.62">uh future do you want to talk about</text><text start="1085.52" dur="5.399">bentoism because I think the idea of uh</text><text start="1088.52" dur="4.08">future us and now us kind of kind of</text><text start="1090.919" dur="5.581">fits into into that</text><text start="1092.6" dur="6.54">yeah um the Bento is a</text><text start="1096.5" dur="5.16">a basically a a thought structure a</text><text start="1099.14" dur="4.56">decision-making framework that I worked</text><text start="1101.66" dur="4.68">on and built a community around for for</text><text start="1103.7" dur="5.46">several years and the Bento is an</text><text start="1106.34" dur="4.38">acronym that stands for Beyond near-term</text><text start="1109.16" dur="4.62">orientation</text><text start="1110.72" dur="4.56">and um one day I was thinking about the</text><text start="1113.78" dur="3.66">concept of self-interest and I was</text><text start="1115.28" dur="4.74">doodling in a notebook</text><text start="1117.44" dur="4.14">a hockey stick graph and I thought this</text><text start="1120.02" dur="3.659">you know this is our image of</text><text start="1121.58" dur="4.979">self-interest today like</text><text start="1123.679" dur="5.341">see in your slide deck that yeah revenue</text><text start="1126.559" dur="5.521">is going up that&apos;s it right yeah up and</text><text start="1129.02" dur="5.46">to the right and</text><text start="1132.08" dur="4.62">um and I just I I don&apos;t know I just</text><text start="1134.48" dur="4.38">tried extending the lines</text><text start="1136.7" dur="4.74">of the X and Y axis because I thought</text><text start="1138.86" dur="4.02">you know the the time axis keeps going</text><text start="1141.44" dur="4.08">as far into the future as we want and</text><text start="1142.88" dur="4.5">also the axis measuring self-interest I</text><text start="1145.52" dur="4.32">also that think that keeps growing like</text><text start="1147.38" dur="3.96">that can go infinitely and also the more</text><text start="1149.84" dur="3.06">your self-interest grows like other</text><text start="1151.34" dur="3.0">things happen too and so when I when I</text><text start="1152.9" dur="4.019">expanded this suddenly there&apos;s this</text><text start="1154.34" dur="5.82">giant space and this like hockey stick</text><text start="1156.919" dur="6.781">graph is just this tiny tiny little Mark</text><text start="1160.16" dur="6.0">in one corner of it it ended up turning</text><text start="1163.7" dur="4.56">this into a basic sort of two by two of</text><text start="1166.16" dur="3.48">four quadrants and and the bottom left</text><text start="1168.26" dur="4.26">was</text><text start="1169.64" dur="5.64">the bottom left box is now me and that&apos;s</text><text start="1172.52" dur="4.5">where that uh that hockey stick graphs</text><text start="1175.28" dur="3.66">lives and that&apos;s that&apos;s the concept of</text><text start="1177.02" dur="5.1">self-interest that we all live with</text><text start="1178.94" dur="5.34">generally today which is you know what I</text><text start="1182.12" dur="4.32">need want and need right now is what</text><text start="1184.28" dur="5.04">matters and these are like low things on</text><text start="1186.44" dur="5.88">Maslow&apos;s hierarchy but if you move to</text><text start="1189.32" dur="6.12">the bottom right box you see future me</text><text start="1192.32" dur="5.34">which is the person that you will become</text><text start="1195.44" dur="4.32">or you hope to become and what you</text><text start="1197.66" dur="4.019">quickly realize is you see that is that</text><text start="1199.76" dur="4.02">person becomes real or not real at any</text><text start="1201.679" dur="3.0">given moment based on what now me is</text><text start="1203.78" dur="4.5">doing</text><text start="1204.679" dur="6.421">if you move up to the top left uh above</text><text start="1208.28" dur="5.58">now me you have now us</text><text start="1211.1" dur="4.559">um you know because as your decisions uh</text><text start="1213.86" dur="3.299">as your self-interest grows you have</text><text start="1215.659" dur="3.301">responsibilities</text><text start="1217.159" dur="3.661">your decisions affect your family the</text><text start="1218.96" dur="3.66">people around you so thinking about them</text><text start="1220.82" dur="3.96">and their needs is also part of your</text><text start="1222.62" dur="4.439">self-interest and finally you have</text><text start="1224.78" dur="4.2">future Us in the top right corner</text><text start="1227.059" dur="3.781">which represents your kids if you have</text><text start="1228.98" dur="4.439">them or future kids</text><text start="1230.84" dur="4.38">and you see how the choices you make you</text><text start="1233.419" dur="4.561">should make them thinking about their</text><text start="1235.22" dur="4.319">interests and uh and just like filtering</text><text start="1237.98" dur="2.819">your choices yeah through what it would</text><text start="1239.539" dur="3.481">do for them and what&apos;s important for</text><text start="1240.799" dur="5.221">them and as you</text><text start="1243.02" dur="6.48">as I like Came Upon This form for the</text><text start="1246.02" dur="6.06">first time uh it instantly felt very</text><text start="1249.5" dur="4.08">true to me um and I wrote written down a</text><text start="1252.08" dur="3.66">written down a very basic description</text><text start="1253.58" dur="3.959">Beyond near-term orientation that&apos;s what</text><text start="1255.74" dur="4.5">this was a picture of and I realized</text><text

dur="5.52">generally we struggle to think about</text><text start="1288.5" dur="6.419">with much Clarity and and so the Bento</text><text start="1292.28" dur="4.86">is a is a tool it&apos;s a tool to

dur="4.14">beautiful I mean I I think it was kind</text><text start="1321.08" dur="3.959">of a a mind-blowing moment for me to</text><text start="1323.059" dur="4.74">learn about bentoism in that two

dur="4.62">communities it&apos;s probably just to be</text><text start="1513.559" dur="4.261">recognized or just to not feel alone or</text><text start="1516.2" dur="3.839">just to have a collaborator

that&apos;s a viable path</text><text start="1556.039" dur="4.201">and I think it&apos;s one that a lot of</text><text start="1557.299" dur="4.561">people will will gladly opt into yeah I</text><text

think that the joint</text><text start="1566.12" dur="4.14">success is more powerful than the</text><text start="1567.919" dur="4.201">individual success in a lot of ways and</text><text

biology us for us and on the</text><text start="1575.779" dur="3.061">podcast and he was talking about the</text><text start="1576.98" dur="3.12">network State and how each Network state</text><text

the world that you</text><text start="1583.1" dur="3.6">want to correct and that becomes your</text><text start="1584.96" dur="4.079">sort of aggregator your memetic filter</text><text start="1586.7" dur="4.44">would you say that each meta label has</text><text start="1589.039" dur="3.601">to have a one commandment or can it just</text><text start="1591.14" dur="4.44">be based off of the vibe of a certain</text><text start="1592.64" dur="5.1">group or something else</text><text start="1595.58" dur="4.74">um we we have it designated and we have</text><text start="1597.74" dur="4.14">a tool on our site metalabel.xyz it&apos;s</text><text start="1600.32" dur="3.54">the one called elements of a metal label</text><text start="1601.88" dur="4.26">to help you do this but</text><text start="1603.86" dur="4.5">the way I would classify that as purpose</text><text start="1606.14" dur="4.26">you know every meta label has to have a</text><text start="1608.36" dur="4.62">purpose and that purpose is expressed</text><text start="1610.4" dur="5.7">through releases</text><text start="1612.98" dur="5.699">um so a meta label is not just like a</text><text start="1616.1" dur="4.86">passive social club like it exists to</text><text start="1618.679" dur="5.341">create work and put it into the world</text><text start="1620.96" dur="5.339">and how it does that is incredibly</text><text start="1624.02" dur="6.96">open-ended it can be software events</text><text start="1626.299" dur="6.36">whatever protests but but what what</text><text start="1630.98" dur="3.42">makes it powerful</text><text start="1632.659" dur="5.701">is if you have</text><text start="1634.4" dur="6.24">disparate voices uh disparate artifacts</text><text start="1638.36" dur="4.799">that are all reinforcing that same core</text><text start="1640.64" dur="4.68">purpose but that purpose could be</text><text start="1643.159" dur="4.14">for Discord records it was like

the</text><text start="1657.38" dur="3.0">enlightenment</text><text start="1659.24" dur="3.059">um you know they&apos;ve been like a</text><text start="1660.38" dur="4.019">credentialed society of

dur="4.62">scientific journals</text><text start="1668.12" dur="6.179">um and so there I believe that there is</text><text start="1671.12" dur="5.58">that there is that calling</text><text

a</text><text start="1705.26" dur="4.62">disagreement with the world that like</text><text start="1707.899" dur="3.241">you know some some maybe some groups</text><text start="1709.88" dur="2.7">would

then</text><text start="1749.779" dur="5.76">participation so I found that quite</text><text start="1752.72" dur="5.16">quite interesting Yeah so basically if</text><text start="1755.539" dur="4.26">you you know if if your group of people</text><text start="1757.88" dur="4.2">if you do if you define what your</text><text start="1759.799" dur="3.961">purpose is why your group if you

dur="5.939">Dao or even a project like catalog that</text><text start="2000.94" dur="4.26">also like very much connect with the</text><text start="2002.919" dur="3.781">metal label framing because</text><text start="2005.2" dur="3.54">um there are groups of people who maybe</text><text start="2006.7" dur="5.579">care about independent music or about</text><text start="2008.74" dur="5.4">certain types of culture uh and they</text><text start="2012.279" dur="3.481">they have a lot of different skill sets</text><text start="2014.14" dur="3.48">in their group and they want to drop</text><text start="2015.76" dur="4.08">different kinds of releases and they&apos;re</text><text start="2017.62" dur="4.799">interested in funding works and so the</text><text start="2019.84" dur="4.92">meta-label model is something that fits</text><text start="2022.419" dur="4.26">with them quite well</text><text start="2024.76" dur="3.18">um and then you know a personal favorite</text><text start="2026.679" dur="3.36">of mine is a group called The Wide</text><text start="2027.94" dur="4.2">awakes which is started by the artist</text><text start="2030.039" dur="4.74">Hank Willis Thomas members of The Roots</text><text start="2032.14" dur="6.36">uh our members it&apos;s a group of activists</text><text start="2034.779" dur="5.221">and artists who uh decided that they</text><text start="2038.5" dur="3.84">wanted to do all their political work</text><text start="2040.0" dur="4.799">together under one name and through that</text><text start="2042.34" dur="5.52">they&apos;ve done things like put Billboards</text><text start="2044.799" dur="5.461">and all 50 U.S states uh created a</text><text start="2047.86" dur="4.08">mobile soup

they all have this Core</text><text start="2061.119" dur="4.921">theme of helping people become wide</text><text start="2063.159" dur="6.541">awake to their community and uh it&apos;s</text><text start="2066.04" dur="6.539">just it&apos;s just a beautiful project that</text><text start="2069.7" dur="5.52">is is hard to tell what it is from the</text><text start="2072.579" dur="3.961">outside but once you begin to see the</text><text start="2075.22" dur="2.459">world through this lens of there are</text><text start="2076.54" dur="2.579">groups of people who have a shared</text><text start="2077.679" dur="4.321">purpose and they just do different</text><text start="2079.119" dur="5.52">releases together then suddenly you</text><text start="2082.0" dur="4.44">could see the underlying structure</text><text start="2084.639" dur="4.141">um and so I I personally think that</text><text start="2086.44" dur="5.82">there are there are many examples around</text><text start="2088.78" dur="5.839">us and that uh a number of dowels will</text><text start="2092.26" dur="5.28">end up creating meta labels so creating</text><text start="2094.619" dur="4.681">explicit arms of</text><text start="2097.54" dur="3.9">um of their activity that is about</text><text start="2099.3" dur="4.84">dropping things creating releases</text><text start="2101.44" dur="4.679">creating culture I mean FWB I think is</text><text start="2104.14" dur="3.26">like the gold standard at this with so</text><text start="2106.119" dur="5.161">much of what they do</text><text start="2107.4" dur="5.439">nouns is a as another fun example</text><text start="2111.28" dur="3.18">um but so I think that this is a form</text><text start="2112.839" dur="5.24">that</text><text start="2114.46" dur="6.42">is is kind of Internet native is rising</text><text start="2118.079" dur="3.941">and uh and I think something that more</text><text start="2120.88" dur="2.1">and more people are going to want to be</text><text start="2122.02" dur="2.04">a part of</text><text start="2122.98" dur="3.599">right</text><text start="2124.06" dur="4.799">yeah I gotta say the meta-label.xyz</text><text start="2126.579" dur="4.321">website is just beautiful and I know</text><text start="2128.859" dur="4.141">that this is an audio only pod so it</text><text start="2130.9" dur="5.459">can&apos;t transmit that to to anyone who&apos;s</text><text start="2133.0" dur="5.579">listening out there but if it strikes me</text><text start="2136.359" dur="6.72">as just this totally genuine High</text><text start="2138.579" dur="7.321">Fidelity look in into into these meta</text><text start="2143.079" dur="4.861">labels and and it just feels so much</text><text start="2145.9" dur="3.3">more beautiful the the art that I&apos;m</text><text start="2147.94" dur="3.0">seeing at these meta labels that I&apos;m</text><text start="2149.2" dur="5.04">checking out then anything that could be</text><text start="2150.94" dur="5.58">created by some uh top down monolithic</text><text start="2154.24" dur="4.14">record label and and I wonder I wonder</text><text start="2156.52" dur="3.78">if that&apos;s a feature because of the</text><text start="2158.38" dur="3.18">bottoms up nature or the the type the</text><text start="2160.3" dur="2.7">caliber of people that are involved in</text><text start="2161.56" dur="5.58">meta label you just kind of get better</text><text start="2163.0" dur="5.4">art or more sincere storytelling is that</text><text start="2167.14" dur="5.4">an attribute of meta labels you think</text><text start="2168.4" dur="7.62">yeah uh well yeah I mean the art is Ilya</text><text start="2172.54" dur="6.96">udanov who&apos;s amazing and it&apos;s one of our</text><text start="2176.02" dur="6.78">one of our co-founders I mean there</text><text start="2179.5" dur="6.66">yes so one I think because the</text><text start="2182.8" dur="5.64">meta-label structure is</text><text start="2186.16" dur="3.84">I mean it it is in our experience only</text><text start="2188.44" dur="3.24">speaking from the experience of us as a</text><text start="2190.0" dur="5.28">group like it&apos;s extremely collaborative</text><text start="2191.68" dur="6.84">where we are seven people who are all</text><text start="2195.28" dur="5.64">all have amazing pedigrees of projects</text><text start="2198.52" dur="6.3">and we are bringing our best selves to</text><text start="2200.92" dur="6.24">improve each other&apos;s work and and there</text><text start="2204.82" dur="6.0">is a way that this project just speaks</text><text start="2207.16" dur="6.48">to us and has and that we have been</text><text start="2210.82" dur="4.799">extremely</text><text start="2213.64" dur="3.54">um authentic and how we&apos;ve expressed it</text><text start="2215.619" dur="3.121">where like maybe it&apos;s been a little bit</text><text start="2217.18" dur="2.76">opaque sometimes but also like we&apos;re</text><text start="2218.74" dur="3.3">figuring it out and we&apos;re trying to</text><text start="2219.94" dur="4.02">express things as well as we can and</text><text start="2222.04" dur="4.38">like it&apos;s all been a very genuine</text><text start="2223.96" dur="4.92">process of discovery that</text><text start="2226.42" dur="4.8">has come to a place of such Clarity that</text><text start="2228.88" dur="3.9">it&apos;s like did we plan this like this is</text><text start="2231.22" dur="5.22">this is kind of weird</text><text start="2232.78" dur="5.22">um how how how well it&apos;s evolved and</text><text start="2236.44" dur="4.2">um kind of by listening</text><text start="2238.0" dur="5.7">but I do think that</text><text start="2240.64" dur="5.34">the ability of a if you have the right</text><text start="2243.7" dur="5.82">mix of people the ability of a</text><text start="2245.98" dur="5.34">meta-label structure uh to allow a

we use a film set a</text><text start="2257.92" dur="3.54">lots of metaphor for how we work</text><text start="2259.3" dur="4.319">together we&apos;re in a in a film set it&apos;s</text><text start="2261.46" dur="5.22">made up of all people who are experts at</text><text start="2263.619" dur="5.341">their craft and everyone has a has their</text><text start="2266.68" dur="4.32">own say in

is</text><text start="2282.76" dur="5.22">what it should be like or shouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="2284.38" dur="5.94">like and so forms like that are</text><text start="2287.98" dur="3.78">they&apos;re naturally egalitarian you know I</text><text start="2290.32" dur="4.019">think that or they they they&apos;re like</text><text start="2291.76" dur="5.339">both expert driven and egalitarian in</text><text start="2294.339" dur="4.861">their structure a bit and uh and so even</text><text start="2297.099" dur="4.561">the way that we have approached our work</text><text start="2299.2" dur="4.8">it&apos;s very it&apos;s very meta where we&apos;re</text><text start="2301.66" dur="4.26">thinking about the way we do things is</text><text start="2304.0" dur="5.04">maybe

that</text><text start="2746.8" dur="5.34">there is a</text><text start="2749.2" dur="4.139">most viral Twitter threads are people</text><text start="2752.14" dur="3.84">like</text><text

dur="5.7">um and so I guess I think that</text><text start="2784.119" dur="4.261">there are a lot of turn offs there are a</text><text start="2786.4" dur="4.919">lot of turn offs that are cultural</text><text start="2788.38" dur="5.58">turn-offs where I would say if people in</text><text start="2791.319" dur="4.5">my life of creative people in my life</text><text start="2793.96" dur="4.32">um I think there are very few of them</text><text start="2795.819" dur="4.441">who think anything good about crypto</text><text start="2798.28" dur="3.72">except for things I&apos;ve talked

dur="3.901">what</text><text start="2806.079" dur="4.081">um and</text><text start="2808.24" dur="3.119">and you know and I I know the reasons</text><text start="2810.16" dur="4.199">why that&apos;s not true but I also think</text><text start="2811.359" dur="5.941">that is true I think they&apos;re not wrong</text><text start="2814.359" dur="5.22">um and so I think that</text><text start="2817.3" dur="4.559">part of part of</text><text start="2819.579" dur="5.821">part of validating a space I think is</text><text start="2821.859" dur="5.401">about just speaking what&apos;s true and and</text><text start="2825.4" dur="3.719">if things are it&apos;s good to talk</text><text start="2827.26" dur="3.48">about what&apos;s</text><text start="2829.119" dur="3.24">um and</text><text start="2830.74" dur="6.18">it&apos;s great when communities police</text><text start="2832.359" dur="7.26">themselves and uh and so you know I&apos;m</text><text start="2836.92" dur="4.08">I&apos;m just interested in in that in the in</text><text start="2839.619" dur="4.5">the long term</text><text start="2841.0" dur="6.059">um and so yeah nothing strategic here</text><text start="2844.119" dur="5.521">just I think just sort of like a genuine</text><text start="2847.059" dur="5.221">uh processing out loud what my own</text><text start="2849.64" dur="5.699">feelings have been and you know so where</text><text start="2852.28" dur="7.2">that what where that&apos;s led me is to like</text><text start="2855.339" dur="5.641">tune out Twitter but to work a lot on</text><text start="2859.48"

dur="4.08">I think it&apos;s a transforming kind of</text><text start="3159.54" dur="4.62">experience you know and um and so yeah</text><text start="3161.88" dur="4.58">so I think making that

start="3169.94" dur="5.919">yeah well I mean in no small way uh this</text><text start="3173.64" dur="6.0">could be our future and this the story</text><text start="3175.859" dur="5.941">of bentoism really influenced me and you</text><text start="3179.64" dur="4.86">know one of the ways I sort of frame the</text><text start="3181.8" dur="4.08">term that I would like to see in in web3</text><text start="3184.5" dur="3.599">you know everyone&apos;s kind of looking for</text><text start="3185.88" dur="4.38">the next wave all the time but for me</text><text start="3188.099" dur="4.321">I&apos;d love to see us move into a more</text><text start="3190.26" dur="4.26">regenerative Direction which means that</text><text start="3192.42" dur="3.78">resource allocation moves over time or</text><text start="3194.52" dur="4.86">it moves up over time which is the</text><text start="3196.2" dur="4.5">future Dimension and then a you know the</text><text start="3199.38" dur="3.0">whole thing about public goods is</text><text start="3200.7" dur="3.899">basically taking the Bento all the way</text><text start="3202.38" dur="4.679">from the individual all the way out to</text><text start="3204.599" dur="3.96">the uh to the whole world which is kind</text><text start="3207.059" dur="3.421">of you know maybe overshooting the</text><text start="3208.559" dur="4.381">Overton window of what&apos;s possible now</text><text start="3210.48" dur="5.879">but uh you know I guess how would we</text><text start="3212.94" dur="5.76">build a more bentoist web three uh you</text><text start="3216.359" dur="4.561">know is that is that a rotation that you</text><text start="3218.7" dur="4.02">wanna that you want to see and how do we</text><text start="3220.92" dur="4.26">program our values into</text><text start="3222.72" dur="4.68">into our money in in order to create a</text><text start="3225.18" dur="5.04">more bentoist web3</text><text start="3227.4" dur="4.439">yeah I mean</text><text start="3230.22" dur="4.98">well I mean</text><text start="3231.839" dur="7.201">it was when I had already been uh</text><text start="3235.2" dur="6.6">following you know blockchain projects</text><text start="3239.04" dur="5.7">um for a while but you know it was when</text><text start="3241.8" dur="7.5">I saw you sharing the Bento on Twitter</text><text start="3244.74" dur="6.599">and then uh Peter Pan joined the Bando</text><text start="3249.3" dur="3.84">society and Scott Moore from get coin</text><text start="3251.339" dur="5.041">joined the Bender Society</text><text start="3253.14" dur="5.459">um John long from from optimism uh</text><text start="3256.38" dur="4.92">joined the Bento society and then I</text><text start="3258.599" dur="4.681">discovered like this ideological</text><text start="3261.3" dur="3.36">alignment I didn&apos;t even I didn&apos;t know I</text><text start="3263.28" dur="3.9">didn&apos;t know I didn&apos;t know I was like I</text><text start="3264.66" dur="6.419">kind of became aware of it through you</text><text start="3267.18" dur="5.34">um and so to see to find a community of</text><text start="3271.079" dur="3.601">people that</text><text start="3272.52" dur="4.62">was thinking about public goods was</text><text start="3274.68" dur="4.919">thinking about these other spaces was</text><text start="3277.14" dur="4.439">imagining creating infrastructure for</text><text start="3279.599" dur="4.381">the next generation of Builders even as</text><text start="3281.579" dur="4.74">they&apos;re getting started</text><text start="3283.98" dur="5.28">um you know to me that&apos;s just like uh</text><text start="3286.319" dur="3.78">that&apos;s that&apos;s like apex apex kind of</text><text start="3290.099" dur="3.24">um you know of just like so it feels</text><text start="3292.02" dur="2.76">like the starting point is creating like</text><text start="3293.339" dur="3.78">a social shelling point where we&apos;re all</text><text start="3294.78" dur="4.2">talking about it at least and then yeah</text><text start="3297.119" dur="3.541">well it&apos;s like we&apos;ve all you know it&apos;s</text><text start="3298.98" dur="3.42">like I forget there are so many great</text><text start="3300.66" dur="3.48">lines about what maps are but it&apos;s like</text><text start="3302.4" dur="5.34">we&apos;re just we&apos;re starting with a map</text><text start="3304.14" dur="4.32">that includes those spaces and like and</text><text start="3307.74" dur="4.5">so</text><text start="3308.46" dur="5.46">the fact that like any web3 project in a</text><text start="3312.24" dur="3.0">way you know because if because of</text><text start="3313.92" dur="3.36">Bitcoin in a way they have to be like</text><text start="3315.24" dur="3.48">what is your public goods position you</text><text start="3317.28" dur="2.88">know what are what are you doing what</text><text start="3318.72" dur="3.42">are you doing for public goods like</text><text start="3320.16" dur="4.98">you&apos;re stepping into this space like you</text><text start="3322.14" dur="3.54">know prove your Bona fides</text><text start="3325.14" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="3325.68" dur="3.6">so I you know I think that there is</text><text start="3328.38" dur="3.62">um</text><text start="3329.28" dur="4.799">there&apos;s there&apos;s a lot of really</text><text start="3332.0" dur="5.38">pro-social values that are already</text><text start="3334.079" dur="5.22">deeply ingrained whether it&apos;s you know</text><text start="3337.38" dur="4.14">having to publish tokenomics and The</text><text start="3339.299" dur="4.381">Insider Outsider ownership of you know</text><text start="3341.52" dur="3.48">uh the structures of these projects in</text><text start="3343.68" dur="3.54">the very beginning that creates a</text><text start="3345.0" dur="3.78">different impact on the outcome</text><text start="3347.22" dur="4.56">um there&apos;s a lot of different ways that</text><text start="3348.78" dur="4.079">I think that the scales are balanced a</text><text start="3351.78" dur="3.539">bit more</text><text start="3352.859" dur="4.681">um but it&apos;s still as always going to be</text><text start="3355.319" dur="4.921">a tension between</text><text start="3357.54" dur="5.039">capital and social movements and it&apos;s</text><text start="3360.24" dur="6.78">going to be a tension between near-term</text><text start="3362.579" dur="6.961">desires and you know long-term goals and</text><text start="3367.02" dur="6.96">you know and I think that the work that</text><text start="3369.54" dur="6.299">you all have done has done a lot to</text><text start="3373.98" dur="3.96">um and like you know hyperstructures</text><text start="3375.839" dur="4.441">from Jacob and all kinds of great folks</text><text start="3377.94" dur="4.74">it&apos;s like very much tilted to cultural</text><text start="3380.28" dur="4.14">scales towards One Direction and the</text><text start="3382.68" dur="5.399">question is as</text><text start="3384.42" dur="4.98">web3 and crypto gets even bigger and if</text><text start="3388.079" dur="3.361">people start like actually getting</text><text start="3389.4" dur="3.84">customers at scale will it will it</text><text start="3391.44" dur="4.56">persist because web2 of course also</text><text start="3393.24" dur="4.319">began with lots of wonderful beliefs</text><text start="3396.0" dur="3.599">that</text><text start="3397.559" dur="3.601">you know eventually Facebook ate the</text><text start="3399.599" dur="3.301">world and then Facebook seemed like the</text><text start="3401.16" dur="3.959">only company that represented all</text><text start="3402.9" dur="5.459">internet companies</text><text start="3405.119" dur="4.561">you have it you know so it could just be</text><text start="3408.359" dur="3.121">you know it could just be Malik again</text><text start="3409.68" dur="3.24">we&apos;ll see we&apos;ll see</text><text start="3411.48" dur="5.639">yeah do you think we&apos;re on that path</text><text start="3412.92" dur="7.1">with web3 uh not so far not so far but I</text><text start="3417.119" dur="2.901">think that there are</text><text start="3421.04" dur="4.36">it&apos;s hard you know it&apos;s hard to say I&apos;ve</text><text start="3423.359" dur="3.72">I&apos;ve I&apos;ve had people Express a lot of</text><text start="3425.4" dur="4.439">you know concern about the degree of</text><text start="3427.079" dur="4.321">stakes uh VCS will have in a lot of</text><text start="3429.839" dur="2.341">different projects and what happens if</text><text start="3431.4" dur="2.64">like</text><text start="3432.18" dur="4.32">someone controls Us in every percentage</text><text start="3434.04" dur="5.16">of like almost every major protocol like</text><text start="3436.5" dur="3.319">what what dangerous does that create</text><text start="3439.2" dur="3.119">um</text><text start="3439.819" dur="4.061">so I don&apos;t you know it&apos;s it&apos;s hard to</text><text start="3442.319" dur="3.181">say but I think in general you just have</text><text start="3443.88" dur="3.84">to assume</text><text start="3445.5" dur="4.38">that everything has the light and the</text><text start="3447.72" dur="5.22">shadow and that they will constantly be</text><text start="3449.88" dur="5.1">in tension with one another and you yeah</text><text start="3452.94" dur="5.639">there&apos;s no there&apos;s no such thing of of</text><text start="3454.98" dur="5.28">only one so uh I think you have to be</text><text start="3458.579" dur="3.901">prepared for that</text><text start="3460.26" dur="4.44">yeah I kind of feel like the internet of</text><text start="3462.48" dur="4.379">value gives us the ability to distribute</text><text start="3464.7" dur="3.54">value across the computer network and</text><text start="3466.859" dur="3.301">for the first time we can program our</text><text start="3468.24" dur="4.079">values into our money and do it in a</text><text start="3470.16" dur="5.04">global scale and what&apos;s so interesting</text><text start="3472.319" dur="4.681">to me about that is that you know in the</text><text start="3475.2" dur="4.32">meat space I I grew up in Pennsylvania</text><text start="3477.0" dur="4.02">in this small town and my Social Circle</text><text start="3479.52" dur="2.819">and who I married and what I&apos;d be doing</text><text start="3481.02" dur="3.539">for work would just be based out of a</text><text start="3482.339" dur="4.561">geographic area but now any interest I</text><text start="3484.559" dur="4.621">have is I have immediate access through</text><text start="3486.9" dur="4.199">the internet to creators who are like me</text><text start="3489.18" dur="4.02">this allowed us to index on interests</text><text start="3491.099" dur="4.441">and beams instead of instead of physical</text><text start="3493.2" dur="4.5">geography and and you know that gives me</text><text start="3495.54" dur="4.14">a lot of hope that we can assemble these</text><text start="3497.7" dur="4.08">hyperstructures that that support people</text><text start="3499.68" dur="3.06">along that infrastructure and I think</text><text start="3501.78" dur="3.12">that you&apos;re doing really really</text><text start="3502.74" dur="3.359">important work there but I&apos;d like to</text><text start="3504.9" dur="2.939">really think that we can if we can</text><text start="3506.099" dur="3.781">program our values into our money we can</text><text start="3507.839" dur="4.561">we can move from don&apos;t be evil to can&apos;t</text><text start="3509.88" dur="5.1">be evil and and build these institutions</text><text start="3512.4" dur="5.459">that will be pro-social uh approvably</text><text start="3514.98" dur="4.8">and from the ground up but uh I think I</text><text start="3517.859" dur="4.141">might be kind of smoking my own hopium</text><text start="3519.78" dur="4.38">given the the state of the market today</text><text start="3522.0" dur="3.48">so it&apos;s good to know that you that you</text><text start="3524.16" dur="3.24">sort of toss around these debates as</text><text start="3525.48" dur="4.879">well yeah definitely well I mean I think</text><text start="3527.4" dur="2.959">you just uh</text><text start="3532.44" dur="5.1">I can I would say this go around making</text><text start="3534.599" dur="4.441">metal label I can feel my experience I</text><text start="3537.54" dur="4.799">can feel that I&apos;ve gone through things</text><text start="3539.04" dur="5.34">before that have wisened me that have</text><text start="3542.339" dur="3.841">made me a little more patient or you</text><text start="3544.38" dur="2.64">know and</text><text start="3546.18" dur="2.22">um</text><text start="3547.02" dur="3.539">and I think one of the things I take</text><text start="3548.4" dur="5.399">from that is just that there&apos;s</text><text start="3550.559" dur="5.461">the there is a constant balancing that</text><text start="3553.799" dur="6.961">you that you know you want to be</text><text start="3556.02" dur="7.62">prepared for and uh and and yeah just</text><text start="3560.76" dur="5.099">like human nature is never just one way</text><text start="3563.64" dur="3.12">um so I you know I I think that there is</text><text start="3565.859" dur="2.581">a</text><text start="3566.76" dur="3.0">so you know in the same way that a lot</text><text start="3568.44" dur="2.7">of people might look and say oh we&apos;re</text><text start="3569.76" dur="3.12">all on our phones and so everyone is</text><text start="3571.14" dur="4.14">like hyper individuals at this moment</text><text start="3572.88" dur="4.679">and it&apos;s never been more individualistic</text><text start="3575.28" dur="3.96">than now but I believe at the same time</text><text start="3577.559" dur="3.3">that that is true there&apos;s this other</text><text start="3579.24" dur="3.66">thing that is rising at the same moment</text><text start="3580.859" dur="4.081">because we&apos;re all realizing the</text><text start="3582.9" dur="3.719">hollowness of just being a sovereign</text><text start="3584.94" dur="4.5">individual that actually that&apos;s an</text><text start="3586.619" dur="5.341">extremely limited experience and that to</text><text start="3589.44" dur="4.32">get anywhere to do anything it takes</text><text start="3591.96" dur="3.899">coordination and alignment with others</text><text start="3593.76" dur="4.559">and the better coordinated aligned you</text><text start="3595.859" dur="6.121">are the more influential and meaningful</text><text start="3598.319" dur="6.3">your work and your life will be and</text><text start="3601.98" dur="4.5">you know you&apos;ve had to work hard to have</text><text start="3604.619" dur="5.341">that life experience you know you&apos;ve had</text><text start="3606.48" dur="5.22">to like go out of go beyond the lines of</text><text start="3609.96" dur="5.04">like the single player mode of how we&apos;re</text><text start="3611.7" dur="5.52">all taught to think to do that and</text><text start="3615.0" dur="4.319">you know metal able is going to be a</text><text start="3617.22" dur="4.32">part of a slew of web 3 projects that</text><text start="3619.319" dur="3.841">are going to make being a part of a</text><text start="3621.54" dur="4.559">squad being a part of something bigger</text><text start="3623.16" dur="5.459">than you like as trivial and as easy as</text><text start="3626.099" dur="5.821">anything else and and I think that&apos;s</text><text start="3628.619" dur="4.74">going to really change how how people</text><text start="3631.92" dur="3.36">think about this kind of work and how</text><text start="3633.359" dur="4.561">willing they are to do it</text><text start="3635.28" dur="4.44">yeah yeah I sure hope so</text><text start="3637.92" dur="3.06">um I&apos;m realizing we&apos;re over the hour</text><text start="3639.72" dur="2.76">right now so I think we should probably</text><text start="3640.98" dur="2.94">get to wrapping up I could spend another</text><text start="3642.48" dur="3.06">five minutes I don&apos;t know how abruptly</text><text start="3643.92" dur="2.699">you want to wrap up but um is there</text><text start="3645.54" dur="3.059">anything I didn&apos;t ask you that you want</text><text start="3646.619" dur="4.021">to say before we
