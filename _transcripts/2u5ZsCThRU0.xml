today we</text><text start="8.28" dur="5.519">got Fabian who is wow he&apos;s just such an</text><text start="10.98" dur="4.92">OG I mean Fabian was one of the</text><text start="13.799" dur="4.98">co-authors of erc20 which is the</text><text start="15.9" dur="5.219">standard that all tokens well all</text><text start="18.779" dur="3.481">fungible tokens on the ethereum network</text><text start="21.119" dur="2.881">use</text><text start="22.26" dur="4.5">um and well not all but there&apos;s there&apos;s</text><text start="24.0" dur="4.619">substandards that are derived from erc20</text><text start="26.76" dur="4.74">but erc20 is kind of like The Godfather</text><text start="28.619" dur="4.261">or the Godmother of uh of tokens on the</text><text start="31.5" dur="4.38">ethereum network</text><text start="32.88" dur="6.48">um Fabian is also the author of ERC 725</text><text start="35.88" dur="5.58">which is a standard around identity on</text><text start="39.36" dur="3.539">the ethereum network and if you&apos;ve been</text><text start="41.46" dur="3.36">following season two of the green pill</text><text start="42.899" dur="3.901">podcast you know that we&apos;re talking a</text><text start="44.82" dur="3.36">lot about decentralized identity and how</text><text start="46.8" dur="3.599">it can create a more green-pilled World</text><text start="48.18" dur="4.199">by allowing us to track our interactions</text><text start="50.399" dur="3.721">with each other create more positive</text><text start="52.379" dur="3.66">some games through repeat interactions</text><text start="54.12" dur="4.02">Fabian was also involved in the Miss</text><text start="56.039" dur="3.84">project which is before metamask and</text><text start="58.14" dur="5.399">infuria one of the ways that you could</text><text start="59.879" dur="5.581">integrate with the web3 based web</text><text start="63.539" dur="4.321">um and he&apos;s just been a lead Engineers</text><text start="65.46" dur="5.159">thinker in the ethereum space for the</text><text start="67.86" dur="5.46">last half a decade and that&apos;s exciting</text><text start="70.619" dur="6.301">to me because we&apos;re now not pushing</text><text start="73.32" dur="5.52">forward standards for uh tokens and</text><text start="76.92" dur="4.559">missed browsers and stuff like that</text><text start="78.84" dur="6.12">we&apos;re now pushing on universal identity</text><text start="81.479" dur="5.701">and uh account abstraction and so</text><text start="84.96" dur="4.14">um this is this episode we&apos;re basically</text><text start="87.18" dur="4.079">covering the opportunity space of</text><text start="89.1" dur="4.74">identity and creating new token</text><text start="91.259" dur="4.32">standards and also fabian&apos;s working on</text><text start="93.84" dur="3.66">this uh layer one called the Luxo</text><text start="95.579" dur="3.421">Network that is going to put a lot of</text><text start="97.5" dur="3.9">these ideas in practice they have some</text><text start="99.0" dur="4.5">really beautiful apis designs and and</text><text start="101.4" dur="4.079">you know Fabian was right in the right</text><text start="103.5" dur="4.02">place uh in in a lot of things in the</text><text start="105.479" dur="3.6">past of ethereum so that gives me a lot</text><text start="107.52" dur="3.599">of confidence that he&apos;s going to be in</text><text start="109.079" dur="4.561">the right place uh and on to something</text><text start="111.119" dur="3.841">when it comes to Identity and and some</text><text start="113.64" dur="4.32">of the trends that we&apos;re following on</text><text start="114.96" dur="4.92">the green pill podcast so uh Fabian is</text><text start="117.96" dur="3.839">just a gigabraine he&apos;s really smart he&apos;s</text><text start="119.88" dur="3.3">an engineer he also speaks marketing he</text><text start="121.799" dur="2.64">also understands the space really well</text><text start="123.18" dur="3.84">and so I think this is a really fun</text><text start="124.439" dur="5.1">episode episode so uh

start="264.84" dur="4.919">different than usual but I&apos;m good now</text><text start="266.759" dur="4.561">yeah we&apos;re transitioning to winter so I</text><text start="269.759" dur="3.061">think

your</text><text start="275.34" dur="5.34">work for years uh you&apos;re the author of</text><text start="277.08" dur="6.48">The erc20 and ERC 725 uh standards you</text><text start="280.68" dur="4.94">worked on Mist web3js uh and lots of</text><text start="283.56" dur="4.74">great things in the ethereum ecosystem</text><text start="285.62" dur="5.799">and excited to catch up and and talk</text><text start="288.3" dur="5.52">about your most recent work so where</text><text start="291.419" dur="2.941">should we Dive In</text><text start="293.82" dur="3.659">um</text><text start="294.36" dur="5.46">I think we can talk a little bit about</text><text start="297.479" dur="4.44">my my path getting to Luxo I think</text><text start="299.82" dur="3.72">that&apos;s a good idea and then I think the</text><text start="301.919" dur="3.84">standards is probably the next important</text><text start="303.54" dur="5.099">thing that&apos;s what people yeah right now</text><text start="305.759" dur="4.801">talked about on Defcon a lot</text><text start="308.639" dur="3.481">so yeah well I mean I think the</text><text start="310.56" dur="3.78">standards you worked on have been really</text><text start="312.12" dur="4.019">influential on the ecosystem so yeah</text><text start="314.34" dur="3.66">let&apos;s start with your your path to to</text><text start="316.139" dur="3.541">getting to Luxo and and working on those</text><text start="318.0" dur="4.919">standards</text><text start="319.68" dur="5.94">so the kind of short version of it is</text><text start="322.919" dur="4.56">um worked at the team Foundation as lead</text><text start="325.62" dur="3.9">the app developer</text><text start="327.479" dur="3.961">um from from there built together with</text><text start="329.52" dur="4.98">Alexander Van de sander uh the Miss</text><text start="331.44" dur="6.18">browser he was a pretty vocal person uh</text><text start="334.5" dur="4.44">at the time you know in ethereum uh he</text><text start="337.62" dur="2.76">came up with the Miss browser concept</text><text start="338.94" dur="3.84">and really the most fascinating thing</text><text start="340.38" dur="3.96">about the Miss browser concept is that</text><text start="342.78" dur="2.88">most of the things that you know he</text><text start="344.34" dur="4.139">described in this video are not even</text><text start="345.66" dur="4.5">done yet and in fact now will be</text><text start="348.479" dur="3.541">possible with universal profiles and the</text><text start="350.16" dur="3.42">new standards I have built lots of these</text><text start="352.02" dur="3.0">things that yet in this video cannot be</text><text start="353.58" dur="3.24">done nicely</text><text start="355.02" dur="4.2">um so I just wanted to interject for the</text><text start="356.82" dur="5.4">listeners who don&apos;t know uh Miss browser</text><text start="359.22" dur="4.62">was a bundled kind of web browser where</text><text start="362.22" dur="4.62">you would sync the blockchain locally</text><text start="363.84" dur="8.46">and then you could do web3 enabled</text><text start="366.84" dur="6.84">things and uh it kind of was it it was</text><text start="372.3" dur="3.54">was sort of the first idea of</text><text start="373.68" dur="4.14">integrating web3 into a browser-based</text><text start="375.84" dur="3.78">experience but I think that it it didn&apos;t</text><text start="377.82" dur="3.0">really take off because you had to</text><text start="379.62" dur="3.12">download and sync the whole blockchain</text><text start="380.82" dur="3.54">in order to be able to do anything in in</text><text start="382.74" dur="4.14">browser extension that you could install</text><text start="384.36" dur="4.32">and point to inferior kind of beat</text><text start="386.88" dur="3.9">missed in in the marketplace but it was</text><text start="388.68" dur="3.359">still useful proof of concept is that is</text><text start="390.78" dur="3.419">that an accurate portrayal of the Miss</text><text start="392.039" dur="4.801">project</text><text start="394.199" dur="4.381">um actually the Miss browser was the</text><text start="396.84" dur="3.96">thing that initiated all of this so</text><text start="398.58" dur="4.26">metamask was the answer to the missed</text><text start="400.8" dur="4.32">browser and we could have also right I</text><text start="402.84" dur="5.88">mean we could have always pointed to an</text><text start="405.12" dur="5.22">external uh source for the nodes the</text><text start="408.72" dur="3.72">idea of the Miss browser was really to</text><text start="410.34" dur="4.32">try the full decentralized way like</text><text start="412.44" dur="5.28">you&apos;re on your own note you have a local</text><text start="414.66" dur="4.62">uh browser that can run the apps by</text><text start="417.72" dur="3.419">building the best browser by building</text><text start="419.28" dur="4.56">the first wallet we had to literally</text><text start="421.139" dur="5.041">invent the way the apps work and how the</text><text start="423.84" dur="4.199">apps even exist</text><text start="426.18" dur="4.019">um metamask then was kind of like you</text><text start="428.039" dur="3.961">know trying to make the simpler version</text><text start="430.199" dur="3.301">of the Miss browser by saying hey</text><text start="432.0" dur="3.3">instead of making a full browser we just</text><text start="433.5" dur="3.0">make a browse extension</text><text start="435.3" dur="4.2">um and like they kind of like you know</text><text start="436.5" dur="4.62">came out of it came out of mist in a way</text><text start="439.5" dur="3.24">um but it was the centralized version of</text><text start="441.12" dur="2.4">it because you didn&apos;t run your own node</text><text start="442.74" dur="3.48">right</text><text start="443.52" dur="4.56">um and out of this came literally later</text><text start="446.22" dur="3.66">everything else we had after that so the</text><text start="448.08" dur="4.8">Miss browser was kind of the initiation</text><text start="449.88" dur="5.7">and the initial first ever</text><text start="452.88" dur="4.379">the app browser in fact yes first</text><text start="455.58" dur="3.0">whatever web3 browser if you want to</text><text start="457.259" dur="3.601">call it like that</text><text start="458.58" dur="4.679">um and we had to define a lot of pieces</text><text start="460.86" dur="4.86">in that time we had to Define of how you</text><text start="463.259" dur="5.461">talk to a d app right which later you</text><text start="465.72" dur="4.62">know I provided uh like came up with the</text><text start="468.72" dur="4.5">ethereum provider standard which was a</text><text start="470.34" dur="5.16">bit more generic initially we just</text><text start="473.22" dur="4.5">exposed the web3 object into the D app</text><text start="475.5" dur="4.319">which then what the apps used to talk to</text><text start="477.72" dur="4.44">uh you know the browser or later even</text><text start="479.819" dur="4.741">metamask metamask or took that</text><text start="482.16" dur="4.259">um and um</text><text start="484.56" dur="3.78">yeah I mean we had the first the theme</text><text start="486.419" dur="4.321">wallet running this way and figured out</text><text start="488.34" dur="4.139">a lot of things along the way</text><text start="490.74" dur="3.6">so I mean you know</text><text start="492.479" dur="2.94">as a listener and someone who&apos;s followed</text><text start="494.34" dur="2.94">your career what I kind of take away</text><text start="495.419" dur="3.78">from this is that Fabian you&apos;ve been</text><text start="497.28" dur="4.44">sort of on the Forefront of innovating</text><text start="499.199" dur="4.021">in web 3 for years and so</text><text start="501.72" dur="4.14">um I Look Backwards in the rear review</text><text start="503.22" dur="6.479">mirror at the at the success of erc20</text><text start="505.86" dur="5.279">and 725 and web 3.js and it allows me to</text><text start="509.699" dur="3.481">have a lot of confidence looking forward</text><text start="511.139" dur="4.561">that you&apos;re going to help us continue to</text><text start="513.18" dur="4.859">innovate with universal profiles and the</text><text start="515.7" dur="4.259">work that you&apos;re doing these days so um</text><text start="518.039" dur="4.981">it&apos;s been a long journey in it and you</text><text start="519.959" dur="5.401">know I&apos;m curious I&apos;m curious about erc20</text><text start="523.02" dur="4.98">uh maybe that&apos;s the next at least the</text><text start="525.36" dur="4.26">the next thing to to chat about tell me</text><text start="528.0" dur="2.58">about working on the erc20 standard</text><text start="529.62" dur="2.339">because that&apos;s the foundation of</text><text start="530.58" dur="4.199">everything in this space</text><text start="531.959" dur="5.161">it is that&apos;s actually the least</text><text start="534.779" dur="3.721">contribution I made I mean from my</text><text start="537.12" dur="4.32">perspective because this was really</text><text start="538.5" dur="5.279">initially uh vitalik&apos;s uh proposal it</text><text start="541.44" dur="3.72">wasn&apos;t a Wiki page we had to chat like</text><text start="543.779" dur="3.0">as a few developers I&apos;m not sure there</text><text start="545.16" dur="4.679">were like three or four of us debating</text><text start="546.779" dur="5.341">uh how a topic could look like in a</text><text start="549.839" dur="4.861">smart conduct form and at the time there</text><text start="552.12" dur="5.279">was this uh ER EIP repository that</text><text start="554.7" dur="4.38">Martin BC created to discuss ethereum</text><text start="557.399" dur="3.841">proposals around the network</text><text start="559.08" dur="3.72">and literally just two weeks before he</text><text start="561.24" dur="3.659">created this so I thought that&apos;s a great</text><text start="562.8" dur="4.02">place to discuss a standard so instead</text><text start="564.899" dur="3.541">of this Niche wiki page where nobody is</text><text start="566.82" dur="4.38">really really paying attention let&apos;s</text><text start="568.44" dur="5.579">just talk there and so I had to come up</text><text start="571.2" dur="5.88">with a format that was more</text><text start="574.019" dur="6.481">specification like so I kind of you know</text><text start="577.08" dur="5.28">referenced the RFC specification way if</text><text start="580.5" dur="3.18">it&apos;s a bit simpler form and I called it</text><text start="582.36" dur="3.06">a table request for comment because I</text><text start="583.68" dur="3.659">thought it was a great</text><text start="585.42" dur="3.96">way to get input from the community and</text><text start="587.339" dur="4.921">then have a proper standard</text><text start="589.38" dur="4.74">the request for comment became then even</text><text start="592.26" dur="3.84">the name for the standard and it was the</text><text start="594.12" dur="6.12">issue number 20 which created New Year&apos;s</text><text start="596.1" dur="6.0">E20 and um I did some small changes we</text><text start="600.24" dur="3.84">had the discussion of 60 people over</text><text start="602.1" dur="4.32">like a few peer a month period and</text><text start="604.08" dur="4.439">people started adopting it and that this</text><text start="606.42" dur="3.539">became you know the token what&apos;s really</text><text start="608.519" dur="3.721">interesting</text><text start="609.959" dur="4.921">for me though is</text><text start="612.24" dur="4.56">how such a simple agreement on just a</text><text start="614.88" dur="4.5">few functions can have such a strong</text><text start="616.8" dur="4.86">impact on all the things you can build</text><text start="619.38" dur="3.66">on a program of a blockchain right and</text><text start="621.66" dur="4.08">this is this is in my opinion the most</text><text start="623.04" dur="4.5">fascinating thing to see how</text><text start="625.74" dur="4.2">you know what comes out of so little</text><text start="627.54" dur="5.1">agreement if you want</text><text start="629.94" dur="5.1">um and yes it built the basis right icos</text><text start="632.64" dur="3.72">came out of it D5 came out of it nfts</text><text start="635.04" dur="2.4">came out of it literally everything came</text><text start="636.36" dur="2.159">out of it</text><text start="637.44" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="638.519" dur="5.101">and what I&apos;m now doing and this is</text><text start="640.68" dur="4.98">really uh why I took this as a learning</text><text start="643.62" dur="3.779">which was purely I would say a</text><text start="645.66" dur="3.72">coincidence even you know that this took</text><text start="647.399" dur="4.5">off that big time there was a need</text><text start="649.38" dur="5.22">um at the time but like taking this</text><text start="651.899" dur="4.741">learning and then making this more</text><text start="654.6" dur="4.38">consciously right that&apos;s what I&apos;m doing</text><text start="656.64" dur="4.62">now you know like coming up with the</text><text start="658.98" dur="6.18">next set of standards that are</text><text start="661.26" dur="7.259">fundamentally important for the</text><text start="665.16" dur="6.239">the future of this space but doing it</text><text start="668.519" dur="5.041">with some thought and doing it with some</text><text start="671.399" dur="4.081">way where I can already like you know</text><text start="673.56" dur="3.719">anticipate things and put them together</text><text start="675.48" dur="3.419">in the right way that they create a</text><text start="677.279" dur="4.141">great foundation for things to be built</text><text start="678.899" dur="4.68">in the future while using 20</text><text start="681.42" dur="3.78">it was on the end purely you know like</text><text start="683.579" dur="3.481">people said they want tokens with</text><text start="685.2" dur="4.56">Telethon a little bit came up with this</text><text start="687.06" dur="5.1">idea we discussed around it made a bit</text><text start="689.76" dur="4.62">better changed things and came up with</text><text start="692.16" dur="4.5">some basic bare bone thing without</text><text start="694.38" dur="4.68">really stretching our thoughts far too</text><text start="696.66" dur="5.52">uh too far in the future trying to make</text><text start="699.06" dur="5.64">it too complex system because first</text><text start="702.18" dur="4.26">something needed to be adopted right</text><text start="704.7" dur="3.3">um that&apos;s now different when you have</text><text start="706.44" dur="4.019">all this experience what happened over</text><text start="708.0" dur="4.38">these years and you see you know what</text><text start="710.459" dur="4.021">went good right and wrong what could be</text><text start="712.38" dur="4.88">improved now you can make it right and</text><text start="714.48" dur="5.7">you now can make it way better with some</text><text start="717.26" dur="6.34">experience that exists now which didn&apos;t</text><text start="720.18" dur="5.339">exist at all in 2015 November six months</text><text start="723.6" dur="3.6">seven seven eight months after the main</text><text start="725.519" dur="4.741">net was started right was a very</text><text start="727.2" dur="4.92">different time so that actually you know</text><text start="730.26" dur="5.28">I think puts puts me in a way better</text><text start="732.12" dur="4.68">position to like do these standards and</text><text start="735.54" dur="2.82">or improve these standards and create</text><text start="736.8" dur="3.599">these new standards that I have done now</text><text start="738.36" dur="2.94">over the last few years together with my</text><text start="740.399" dur="3.721">team</text><text start="741.3" dur="4.02">I&apos;m wondering if you could do erc20 all</text><text start="744.12" dur="2.82">over again is there anything that you</text><text start="745.32" dur="3.36">would change given the the gift of</text><text start="746.94" dur="5.16">perfect hindsight</text><text start="748.68" dur="7.08">I am actually doing it as a 20 all over</text><text start="752.1" dur="6.66">again actually we have we call it</text><text start="755.76" dur="6.96">Luxor standard proposal number seven so</text><text start="758.76" dur="7.319">it&apos;s called lsb7 and this is literally</text><text start="762.72" dur="6.48">um the new esc20 so it&apos;s actually I did</text><text start="766.079" dur="5.82">exactly that so what was improved is</text><text start="769.2" dur="5.1">number one</text><text start="771.899" dur="4.201">um the way of that actually this this</text><text start="774.3" dur="4.08">token standard calls other smart</text><text start="776.1" dur="4.28">contracts right this idea was not new</text><text start="778.38" dur="4.92">right there was ESC</text><text start="780.38" dur="6.519">777-223 even seven to one has this kind</text><text start="783.3" dur="4.32">of uh on tokens receive function built</text><text start="786.899" dur="3.601">in</text><text start="787.62" dur="5.219">but how we did it is we did it in a</text><text start="790.5" dur="3.42">generic way that it&apos;s a generic function</text><text start="792.839" dur="3.781">you call it called called universal</text><text start="793.92" dur="5.159">receiver that basically can notify any</text><text start="796.62" dur="3.779">smart contract especially profiles</text><text start="799.079" dur="3.841">whatever exists in the future in a</text><text start="800.399" dur="4.141">generic way that means you can now send</text><text start="802.92" dur="3.599">tokens to the smart corner and the token</text><text start="804.54" dur="4.62">the smartphone can react on it</text><text start="806.519" dur="4.38">which is the biggest pain point of es20</text><text start="809.16" dur="3.9">for example that you have to constantly</text><text start="810.899" dur="4.5">do this you know approve and transfer</text><text start="813.06" dur="4.019">from kind of double call</text><text start="815.399" dur="3.781">just to like make a Smart Connect</text><text start="817.079" dur="4.2">understand that he received some tokens</text><text start="819.18" dur="5.7">which is I guess the most biggest pain</text><text start="821.279" dur="5.821">point of D5 in fact so yes that&apos;s</text><text start="824.88" dur="4.5">improved uh what&apos;s also improved is to</text><text start="827.1" dur="3.96">have batch calls built in what&apos;s also</text><text start="829.38" dur="5.94">improved is that you have an unlimited</text><text start="831.06" dur="7.5">way of adding metadata smart on readable</text><text start="835.32" dur="4.56">metadata to your token so now you can</text><text start="838.56" dur="2.7">reference the Json file with some</text><text start="839.88" dur="3.84">pictures and name and description</text><text start="841.26" dur="3.96">website and whatever but you can also</text><text start="843.72" dur="3.72">reference other protocols or other</text><text start="845.22" dur="4.32">tokens or other systems that somehow</text><text start="847.44" dur="4.079">relate to the Token you have literally</text><text start="849.54" dur="4.02">in unlimited key value store that you</text><text start="851.519" dur="5.341">can attach to your token contract which</text><text start="853.56" dur="5.519">will make these extremely extensible in</text><text start="856.86" dur="3.06">in a standardized way</text><text start="859.079" dur="3.721">um</text><text start="859.92" dur="5.219">so that&apos;s kind of the major improvements</text><text start="862.8" dur="4.32">there&apos;s a lot more smaller detail</text><text start="865.139" dur="4.981">improvements but also really what&apos;s</text><text start="867.12" dur="4.56">what&apos;s nice now is the the naming and I</text><text start="870.12" dur="3.06">think when it comes to standards one of</text><text start="871.68" dur="3.48">the most important thing is</text><text start="873.18" dur="4.2">hey you&apos;re having an intuitive naming</text><text start="875.16" dur="5.039">having something that kind of developers</text><text start="877.38" dur="4.8">ideally get and kind of can remember</text><text start="880.199" dur="3.721">without constantly having to go back to</text><text start="882.18" dur="4.38">documentation and reading it again and</text><text start="883.92" dur="4.62">again and right now for example there&apos;s</text><text start="886.56" dur="4.38">a lot of differences between esc20 and</text><text start="888.54" dur="3.539">ESC 7 to 1 in terms of how the functions</text><text start="890.94" dur="2.82">are named</text><text start="892.079" dur="3.181">purely because they all thought they</text><text start="893.76" dur="2.579">want to improve it and change it and</text><text start="895.26" dur="2.759">then they give it different function</text><text start="896.339" dur="3.24">names and all of this and that makes it</text><text start="898.019" dur="3.06">very confusing for people</text><text start="899.579" dur="3.781">so when you do these standard from</text><text start="901.079" dur="4.741">scratch and you really don&apos;t care about</text><text start="903.36" dur="3.779">the past because you create a new</text><text start="905.82" dur="2.28">network and you can literally do things</text><text start="907.139" dur="3.541">right</text><text start="908.1" dur="4.739">we can clean up that mess and kind of</text><text start="910.68" dur="4.74">you know unify function names in a way</text><text start="912.839" dur="5.041">that they are now consistent across nfts</text><text start="915.42" dur="4.62">and token standards and in the way they</text><text start="917.88" dur="4.74">act and behave and everything so it&apos;s</text><text start="920.04" dur="4.859">it&apos;s also a clean house cleaning task</text><text start="922.62" dur="4.079">that we did in a way on top of that</text><text start="924.899" dur="3.721">Improvement yeah</text><text start="926.699" dur="3.301">yeah I mean having having users is a</text><text start="928.62" dur="2.7">double-edged sword because you have</text><text start="930.0" dur="3.24">Network effects that come out of that</text><text start="931.32" dur="3.3">but you also have a lot of Legacy things</text><text start="933.24" dur="3.599">that you if you could do it all over</text><text start="934.62" dur="4.98">again you&apos;d probably do differently</text><text start="936.839" dur="4.981">um so I&apos;d love to segue from ERC oh</text><text start="939.6" dur="3.96">sorry go ahead no exactly I mean I fully</text><text start="941.82" dur="4.92">agree with you this is exactly the the</text><text start="943.56" dur="6.12">big problem that you know ethereum&apos;s uh</text><text start="946.74" dur="4.26">standard space has right this a lot of</text><text start="949.68" dur="2.459">people want to propose things but</text><text start="951.0" dur="3.0">there&apos;s a lot of people already went</text><text start="952.139" dur="4.801">with some way right and they already</text><text start="954.0" dur="4.139">went down Rabbit Hole a so it&apos;s very</text><text start="956.94" dur="4.86">hard to convince them to go to Rapid</text><text start="958.139" dur="5.341">hole C or D and if you create a new</text><text start="961.8" dur="4.26">network from scratch</text><text start="963.48" dur="4.62">people are very willing to adopt and use</text><text start="966.06" dur="3.839">the new standard from scratch that gives</text><text start="968.1" dur="3.72">basically if they&apos;re the right standards</text><text start="969.899" dur="4.141">in the right way give people a lot more</text><text start="971.82" dur="3.54">possibilities of what they can build and</text><text start="974.04" dur="4.26">you can create a whole different unit of</text><text start="975.36" dur="5.219">experience something very hard to</text><text start="978.3" dur="4.08">to push through in an existing Network</text><text start="980.579" dur="3.481">and this is really a little bit same</text><text start="982.38" dur="3.48">with Bitcoin by the way in any other</text><text start="984.06" dur="3.36">network right they always have that</text><text start="985.86" dur="3.419">baggage of</text><text start="987.42" dur="4.08">people have a way of doing things and</text><text start="989.279" dur="4.341">they kind of want to stick with it in a</text><text start="991.5" dur="2.12">way</text><text start="993.72" dur="5.7">yeah yeah backwards compatibility is a</text><text start="996.54" dur="4.32">uh uh is a problem but also</text><text start="999.42" dur="3.06">yeah</text><text start="1000.86" dur="4.26">um so I mean I I&apos;d love to segue from</text><text start="1002.48" dur="4.5">talking to from erc20 which is a</text><text start="1005.12" dur="5.159">foundational part of tokens in the</text><text start="1006.98" dur="5.4">ethereum space to erc725 which is an</text><text start="1010.279" dur="4.62">identity standard and just as I prompt</text><text start="1012.38" dur="3.66">you to talk about ERC 725 one of the you</text><text start="1014.899" dur="2.88">know this is the green pill podcast</text><text start="1016.04" dur="4.08">we&apos;re talking about regenerative uses of</text><text start="1017.779" dur="3.721">crypto positive some uses of crypto and</text><text start="1020.12" dur="4.199">one of sort of the ideas that we&apos;ve been</text><text start="1021.5" dur="4.62">playing with is this idea that</text><text start="1024.319" dur="3.541">um with identity we can now have these</text><text start="1026.12" dur="3.059">pseudonymous identities where because we</text><text start="1027.86" dur="3.0">can track our interactions with each</text><text start="1029.179" dur="3.301">other we can have more positive some</text><text start="1030.86" dur="3.66">games through repeat interactions with</text><text start="1032.48" dur="3.479">each other therefore complexifying the</text><text start="1034.52" dur="3.779">design space and allowing for more</text><text start="1035.959" dur="4.74">regenerative crypto uh projects to be</text><text start="1038.299" dur="5.701">built so I&apos;m just really curious to know</text><text start="1040.699" dur="6.0">you know why ERC 725 was proposed how</text><text start="1044.0" dur="4.26">it&apos;s going and um maybe you could give</text><text start="1046.699" dur="3.36">us a little bit of a hint of of how</text><text start="1048.26" dur="6.32">that&apos;s evolving into Universal profiles</text><text start="1050.059" dur="4.521">over from your Vantage Point hmm</text><text start="1055.039" dur="5.161">um I mean first off uh or you&apos;re totally</text><text start="1058.1" dur="4.8">right right the biggest missing piece in</text><text start="1060.2" dur="4.26">blockchain is is identity I mean we have</text><text start="1062.9" dur="4.2">all we have an identifier it&apos;s an</text><text start="1064.46" dur="4.32">address it&apos;s just a very unhuman</text><text start="1067.1" dur="2.579">readable identifier and that&apos;s the big</text><text start="1068.78" dur="4.139">issue</text><text start="1069.679" dur="5.701">um it&apos;s not very identifiable uh by</text><text start="1072.919" dur="3.601">machines yes by people not so much</text><text start="1075.38" dur="2.64">um and that&apos;s the biggest issue and</text><text start="1076.52" dur="3.899">that&apos;s exactly why a lot of use cases</text><text start="1078.02" dur="4.92">aren&apos;t happening and that&apos;s why</text><text start="1080.419" dur="3.781">literally the nft space is [ __ ] if I</text><text start="1082.94" dur="3.66">can say that in this podcast I&apos;m not</text><text start="1084.2" dur="4.08">sure how you</text><text start="1086.6" dur="4.74">um but I mean it&apos;s it&apos;s basically a</text><text start="1088.28" dur="5.94">problem because the identify identifying</text><text start="1091.34" dur="5.64">creators are not very visible right your</text><text start="1094.22" dur="5.94">your product your nft is visible you as</text><text start="1096.98" dur="7.46">the actual person group Dao brand</text><text start="1100.16" dur="9.3">whatever created it totally invisible so</text><text start="1104.44" dur="7.78">725 basically came initially out of a uh</text><text start="1109.46" dur="5.04">some you know workshops I did</text><text start="1112.22" dur="4.68">um and the idea was let&apos;s create a smart</text><text start="1114.5" dur="4.62">content-based account system I had them</text><text start="1116.9" dur="3.899">make some thoughts about how to do this</text><text start="1119.12" dur="3.72">I came up with a very basic concept</text><text start="1120.799" dur="2.88">which was the first version of seven to</text><text start="1122.84" dur="3.86">five</text><text start="1123.679" dur="5.88">I somehow after that had this urge to</text><text start="1126.7" dur="5.08">propose this as a standard and I was</text><text start="1129.559" dur="5.101">working at ethereum I had literally no</text><text start="1131.78" dur="5.34">idea or interest in doing anything work</text><text start="1134.66" dur="5.639">identity whatsoever</text><text start="1137.12" dur="5.52">um there was Civic protocol and and</text><text start="1140.299" dur="5.521">what&apos;s the consensus version</text><text start="1142.64" dur="4.919">uh Newport at the time in Newport yeah</text><text start="1145.82" dur="4.44">no they were all like the big the big</text><text start="1147.559" dur="4.381">players at the time and yeah</text><text start="1150.26" dur="3.659">um I had totally nothing to do with this</text><text start="1151.94" dur="4.619">I just had this urge that I need to</text><text start="1153.919" dur="4.021">somehow write this in a doc as an ERC</text><text start="1156.559" dur="3.541">which I did</text><text start="1157.94" dur="4.859">um somehow it took traction people got</text><text start="1160.1" dur="5.12">all like really interested in that and</text><text start="1162.799" dur="5.76">Newport got quite offended</text><text start="1165.22" dur="6.94">because they said oh my God a smart kind</text><text start="1168.559" dur="5.761">of basic counts are you crazy and uh you</text><text start="1172.16" dur="4.68">cannot put everything on chain and</text><text start="1174.32" dur="4.26">um wrote big like big articles like</text><text start="1176.84" dur="4.199">saying why this is a monolith and they</text><text start="1178.58" dur="4.8">want to build a modular system</text><text start="1181.039" dur="4.081">uh long story short</text><text start="1183.38" dur="3.539">um I literally thought other people</text><text start="1185.12" dur="3.78">would go do something with the standard</text><text start="1186.919" dur="4.561">I worked you know continued work on web</text><text start="1188.9" dur="5.1">3.js and other things in ethereum I just</text><text start="1191.48" dur="4.5">put it out there it got traction there</text><text start="1194.0" dur="4.74">was the origin protocol that they like</text><text

start="2102.52" dur="3.72">that&apos;s pretty much yeah there&apos;s a really</text><text start="2104.14" dur="3.959">there&apos;s a really interesting episode on</text><text start="2106.24" dur="4.02">Bank lists in which Evan McMullen and</text><text start="2108.099" dur="4.561">vitalik talk about the various merits of</text><text start="2110.26" dur="3.9">Soul bound tokens in vitalik&apos;s case and</text><text start="2112.66" dur="3.179">off-chain the IDS and verifiable</text><text start="2114.16" dur="3.24">credentials</text><text start="2115.839" dur="2.821">um and I think that it&apos;s an important</text><text start="2117.4" dur="4.14">thing to get right so I&apos;ll just direct</text><text start="2118.66" dur="6.48">listeners to to that show if they want</text><text start="2121.54" dur="5.16">to learn more about identity and privacy</text><text start="2125.14" dur="3.06">um I&apos;m curious I&apos;m curious if you&apos;ve</text><text start="2126.7" dur="5.1">read the decentralized society paper</text><text start="2128.2" dur="6.3">Fabian uh by vitalik and Glenn and in</text><text start="2131.8" dur="4.74">Puja and if so what you think of that</text><text start="2134.5" dur="4.56">vision of blockchain-based identity I</text><text start="2136.54" dur="4.26">can quickly recap it if if you&apos;d like uh</text><text start="2139.06" dur="5.0">yeah please do because I have not I&apos;m</text><text start="2140.8" dur="6.66">too busy inventing that then</text><text start="2144.06" dur="5.26">yeah yeah no the idea with decentralized</text><text start="2147.46" dur="3.84">society which is is called like</text><text start="2149.32" dur="4.019">searching for web 3&apos;s Soul was the name</text><text start="2151.3" dur="3.48">of the paper but um because it was all</text><text start="2153.339" dur="3.24">about Soul bound tokens which are</text><text start="2154.78" dur="3.96">basically nfts that can&apos;t be transferred</text><text start="2156.579" dur="4.681">like you know say I go to some event and</text><text start="2158.74" dur="4.8">I get a nft from that event that says</text><text start="2161.26" dur="3.78">that I go went to it and it can&apos;t be</text><text start="2163.54" dur="3.539">transferred that makes it so that it</text><text start="2165.04" dur="4.319">can&apos;t be financialized and so the</text><text start="2167.079" dur="4.741">ultimate articulation of this vision is</text><text start="2169.359" dur="4.561">that vitalik and Glenn imagine this sort</text><text start="2171.82" dur="3.6">of web of trust where say I sent you</text><text start="2173.92" dur="2.58">actually I should do this now that I</text><text start="2175.42" dur="2.28">think about it I should send you an nft</text><text start="2176.5" dur="3.42">saying you&apos;ve been a guest on the</text><text start="2177.7" dur="3.96">Greenville podcast and that&apos;s an</text><text start="2179.92" dur="3.84">identity signal about our relationship</text><text start="2181.66" dur="4.5">with each other at scale if you&apos;re</text><text start="2183.76" dur="3.599">sending tokens uh whether they&apos;re poapps</text><text start="2186.16" dur="3.24">or cell bound tokens to other people</text><text start="2187.359" dur="3.541">there&apos;s a web of trust that we can use</text><text start="2189.4" dur="4.02">to bootstrap things like civil</text><text start="2190.9" dur="5.219">resistance and</text><text start="2193.42" dur="4.74">um and under collateralized loans and</text><text start="2196.119" dur="3.48">web 3 social networks with profiles and</text><text start="2198.16" dur="2.82">stuff like that</text><text start="2199.599" dur="3.121">um and so that&apos;s that&apos;s kind of the</text><text start="2200.98" dur="3.599">articulation of decentralized society</text><text start="2202.72" dur="3.42">and I&apos;d be curious if we could compare</text><text start="2204.579" dur="3.121">and contrast that with your vision and</text><text start="2206.14" dur="3.42">what you&apos;re working on with 725 and</text><text start="2207.7" dur="4.26">Universal profiles if there&apos;s any</text><text start="2209.56" dur="4.68">overlap it&apos;s completely overlapping what</text><text start="2211.96" dur="5.639">I built is exactly the ground</text><text start="2214.24" dur="5.76">structure for this so it&apos;s so Universal</text><text start="2217.599" dur="4.74">profiles are the soul of Soul Bond</text><text start="2220.0" dur="4.079">tokens I personally don&apos;t really like</text><text start="2222.339" dur="4.141">these kind of naming convention that</text><text start="2224.079" dur="5.461">vitalik chose because he was a I guess</text><text start="2226.48" dur="5.16">play war hammer game or whatever this</text><text start="2229.54" dur="4.5">game was that he was into</text><text start="2231.64" dur="4.199">um uh yeah World of Warcraft exactly</text><text start="2234.04" dur="2.34">yeah so</text><text start="2235.839" dur="2.461">um</text><text start="2236.38" dur="4.68">I mean I call them non-transferable</text><text start="2238.3" dur="5.819">tokens I I like a bit more The Logical</text><text start="2241.06" dur="5.1">naming uh then it&apos;s not so in big quiz</text><text start="2244.119" dur="4.381">um but if you call it songbound token</text><text start="2246.16" dur="4.38">the universe broke without a soul and</text><text start="2248.5" dur="4.98">and the problem right now is exactly</text><text start="2250.54" dur="4.74">that there is no soul your wallet</text><text start="2253.48" dur="3.42">account is not a soul this is not</text><text start="2255.28" dur="4.2">something you can ever use for that</text><text start="2256.9" dur="4.5">because you forget your private key and</text><text start="2259.48" dur="4.859">what all your reputation is social</text><text start="2261.4" dur="6.24">interactions are now stuck and gone or</text><text start="2264.339" dur="4.861">uh basically it&apos;s unmanageable it&apos;s not</text><text start="2267.64" dur="2.58">a reputation system that works in any</text><text start="2269.2" dur="2.34">way</text><text start="2270.22" dur="4.08">um or your friend gets hold of it and</text><text start="2271.54" dur="3.78">now they can be you and act as you</text><text start="2274.3" dur="2.7">um</text><text start="2275.32" dur="3.299">so what we&apos;re missing is a soul</text><text start="2277.0" dur="3.42">Universal properties are the soul for</text><text start="2278.619" dur="3.421">sober tokens and yes exactly what I</text><text start="2280.42" dur="3.48">described before you can attach this</text><text start="2282.04" dur="4.799">reputation system that could be based on</text><text start="2283.9" dur="4.439">an nft or a non-transferable token that</text><text start="2286.839" dur="3.301">could be based on some kind of registry</text><text start="2288.339" dur="4.441">that people agreed to some kind of point</text><text start="2290.14" dur="5.04">system actually I would be building</text><text start="2292.78" dur="4.319">these more on top of a point system but</text><text start="2295.18" dur="4.26">yes I mean for example we had a</text><text start="2297.099" dur="4.921">hackathon and we gave people</text><text start="2299.44" dur="4.26">um a participant nft and so on but right</text><text start="2302.02" dur="3.12">now they&apos;re transferable but I mean it&apos;s</text><text start="2303.7" dur="3.36">very easy to make them non-transferable</text><text start="2305.14" dur="3.54">once we launch mainnet and then</text><text start="2307.06" dur="3.96">something that&apos;s stuck on your profile</text><text start="2308.68" dur="5.46">and the good thing is because your</text><text start="2311.02" dur="6.72">profile is very hard to lose not like a</text><text start="2314.14" dur="5.4">key it actually can like this Society in</text><text start="2317.74" dur="3.96">this Vision that I was saying I&apos;m fully</text><text start="2319.54" dur="4.559">agree with this by the way was totally</text><text start="2321.7" dur="4.02">able to happen and the only reason why</text><text start="2324.099" dur="4.921">it couldn&apos;t happen so far is because</text><text start="2325.72" dur="5.58">people like use wallet private Keys as</text><text start="2329.02" dur="4.079">their accounts which is obviously not</text><text start="2331.3" dur="4.68">the way it can happen ever</text><text start="2333.099" dur="6.0">but if you have a profile that you in</text><text start="2335.98" dur="5.28">the worst case consult your recover</text><text start="2339.099" dur="4.921">or you even have a third-party Recovery</text><text start="2341.26" dur="4.92">Service you trust or you have even three</text><text start="2344.02" dur="3.599">their five devices you control it from</text><text start="2346.18" dur="3.439">so if like</text><text start="2347.619" dur="4.5">like four are gone you still have access</text><text start="2349.619" dur="3.761">or you have a dial that could gain your</text><text start="2352.119" dur="4.801">access back</text><text start="2353.38" dur="5.1">everything now possible right then you</text><text start="2356.92" dur="3.36">can actually literally get started have</text><text start="2358.48" dur="3.78">stuffed and stuck it on a profile and</text><text start="2360.28" dur="3.54">literally make it unmovable you don&apos;t</text><text start="2362.26" dur="3.599">even need to think about a logic anymore</text><text start="2363.82" dur="5.64">of how you moved it in whatever lock</text><text start="2365.859" dur="5.461">case have lost because it&apos;s unusable</text><text start="2369.46" dur="4.379">um and that changes the game</text><text start="2371.32" dur="3.779">so I fully agree what they&apos;re saying and</text><text start="2373.839" dur="3.961">this is what I have built up the</text><text start="2375.099" dur="6.541">foundation

start="2383.5" dur="4.92">um by people and</text><text start="2385.599" dur="5.041">and by developers really and this this</text><text start="2388.42" dur="4.14">is now all possible yeah it will change</text><text start="2390.64" dur="4.08">the game yeah</text><text start="2392.56" dur="3.779">so I&apos;m curious um you know given that we</text><text start="2394.72" dur="3.66">only have about 10 minutes left if we</text><text start="2396.339" dur="3.841">can if we can start converging I&apos;d be</text><text start="2398.38" dur="2.58">curious you know</text><text start="2400.18" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="2400.96" dur="6.54">what what you&apos;re focused on now uh how</text><text start="2404.32" dur="5.1">people can can help contribute and and</text><text start="2407.5" dur="3.96">how people can get involved in building</text><text start="2409.42" dur="6.84">this future that that you&apos;re working on</text><text start="2411.46" dur="7.26">yeah all right um so basically we are we</text><text start="2416.26" dur="3.78">will start our mainnet in the coming</text><text start="2418.72" dur="3.54">months</text><text start="2420.04" dur="3.96">um that&apos;s if that&apos;s basically we&apos;re</text><text start="2422.26" dur="3.12">starting a new ethereum let&apos;s call it</text><text start="2424.0" dur="3.92">like this because it&apos;s actually easy to</text><text start="2425.38" dur="5.52">type of network just a new network</text><text start="2427.92" dur="4.3">focused on the new creative economy I</text><text start="2430.9" dur="4.26">don&apos;t want to see it as a competition to</text><text start="2432.22" dur="5.399">ethereum it might end up being that but</text><text start="2435.16" dur="6.0">I see it more as an let&apos;s call it system</text><text start="2437.619" dur="5.281">Network extension right now but it&apos;s</text><text start="2441.16" dur="4.08">built as a new network because we need</text><text start="2442.9" dur="4.5">to have this new basic standards and we</text><text start="2445.24" dur="4.379">have to have this uh focus of these</text><text start="2447.4" dur="4.8">people who built on these new kind of uh</text><text start="2449.619" dur="4.101">setups because they enable all of these</text><text start="2452.2" dur="5.04">new things that we&apos;ve just talked about</text><text start="2453.72" dur="4.899">in the past so we have the standards we</text><text start="2457.24" dur="4.14">have the smartphone implementation we</text><text start="2458.619" dur="3.841">have a browser extension you can test</text><text start="2461.38" dur="3.3">out</text><text start="2462.46" dur="3.659">there&apos;s a whole documentation page we</text><text start="2464.68" dur="4.14">can read about all of this so if you&apos;re</text><text start="2466.119" dur="4.141">developer and you want to really build</text><text start="2468.82" dur="2.82">all of these things you for example</text><text start="2470.26" dur="3.38">mentioned right the ones in the social</text><text start="2471.64" dur="5.219">space and the in the</text><text start="2473.64" dur="6.4">not detail but regen how you call that</text><text start="2476.859" dur="5.76">region space uh yeah</text><text start="2480.04" dur="5.16">um then this is the tool chain for doing</text><text start="2482.619" dur="4.261">that it is the absolute two chain you</text><text start="2485.2" dur="3.96">could use uh Universal problems on any</text><text start="2486.88" dur="3.54">other evm chain that&apos;s possible it&apos;s</text><text start="2489.16" dur="3.3">only on the interest Smart Connect</text><text start="2490.42" dur="4.08">standards our project sensory won&apos;t</text><text start="2492.46" dur="4.5">support it out of the box obviously for</text><text start="2494.5" dur="5.099">for obvious reasons</text><text start="2496.96" dur="5.399">um but what&apos;s really missing is the</text><text start="2499.599" dur="5.041">transaction relay Services that&apos;s what</text><text start="2502.359" dur="4.5">you want so and we will run one we will</text><text start="2504.64" dur="4.8">have one from the get-go and another</text><text start="2506.859" dur="4.381">reason why a new network is we can fund</text><text start="2509.44" dur="3.72">early users we can subsidize their</text><text start="2511.24" dur="3.9">profiles and we can subsidize their</text><text start="2513.16" dur="3.72">initial transactions that&apos;s how you</text><text start="2515.14" dur="4.68">basically get to use the blockchain</text><text start="2516.88" dur="5.34">right away without any of the hassle</text><text start="2519.82" dur="3.96">um what we also instigating you know</text><text start="2522.22" dur="4.859">through our hackathons and others for</text><text start="2523.78" dur="4.98">example the one we did at git coin uh is</text><text start="2527.079" dur="3.901">to foreign</text><text start="2528.76" dur="3.72">less Services now because all of this is</text><text start="2530.98" dur="4.859">standardized building one is fairly</text><text start="2532.48" dur="6.3">simple so you can basically be the</text><text start="2535.839" dur="5.401">mobile or phone provider or Internet</text><text start="2538.78" dur="5.28">service provider of the blockchain and</text><text start="2541.24" dur="5.52">say come sign up with me get a free</text><text start="2544.06" dur="4.38">profile and 10 million gas and then you</text><text start="2546.76" dur="3.48">know subscribe next month</text><text start="2548.44" dur="4.159">and that&apos;s how you get people using</text><text start="2550.24" dur="4.8">blockchain without the day you know</text><text start="2552.599" dur="3.881">being scared away they can also be then</text><text start="2555.04" dur="3.24">the first Recovery Service of your</text><text start="2556.48" dur="4.32">profile and all of that you know web 2</text><text start="2558.28" dur="4.079">ease of use we know while at the same</text><text start="2560.8" dur="2.819">time you have a full-on web3 profile and</text><text start="2562.359" dur="2.401">you can click them out at any point in</text><text start="2563.619" dur="2.821">time and even pay you on transaction</text><text start="2564.76" dur="3.66">fees if you like just fill up your</text><text start="2566.44" dur="5.28">controller key with some feed some money</text><text start="2568.42" dur="5.52">and that&apos;s it so it requires a bit more</text><text start="2571.72" dur="4.139">things you know that&apos;s why Luxor the</text><text start="2573.94" dur="3.419">mainnet with transaction relay service</text><text start="2575.859" dur="3.361">initially and all of these things for</text><text start="2577.359" dur="3.361">this to take off</text><text start="2579.22" dur="3.119">um eventually it will triple down to</text><text start="2580.72" dur="3.06">other networks as well so if you&apos;re a</text><text start="2582.339" dur="3.901">developer and Builder</text><text start="2583.78" dur="4.44">go read the docs understand how to do</text><text start="2586.24" dur="3.96">this it&apos;s not a lot of things you need</text><text start="2588.22" dur="4.26">to understand if you just want to make</text><text start="2590.2" dur="3.48">it the app that works with metamask</text><text start="2592.48" dur="2.099">right now you literally have to change</text><text start="2593.68" dur="2.58">nothing</text><text start="2594.579" dur="3.601">but if you want to use the power of</text><text start="2596.26" dur="4.559">universal profiles if you really want to</text><text start="2598.18" dur="4.679">do something around profiles you know</text><text start="2600.819" dur="4.5">just read the talks and read how you</text><text start="2602.859" dur="3.96">attach information how you get</text><text start="2605.319" dur="4.321">permission set permission to whatever</text><text start="2606.819" dur="6.3">you want and then you can really invent</text><text start="2609.64" dur="6.06">the next level uh social protocols</text><text start="2613.119" dur="4.74">Community protocols Styles whatever else</text><text start="2615.7" dur="4.919">you want and it&apos;s going to be a lot</text><text start="2617.859" dur="5.701">easier for you doing that than it has</text><text start="2620.619" dur="6.121">been the last five years where none of</text><text start="2623.56" dur="3.72">these basic things were solved um all</text><text start="2626.74" dur="2.4">right</text><text start="2627.28" dur="3.539">um I&apos;m curious you know if you can</text><text start="2629.14" dur="4.38">project this out 10 years into the</text><text start="2630.819" dur="4.02">future right I I know when I asked you</text><text start="2633.52" dur="3.48">about like what were the ultimate use of</text><text start="2634.839" dur="3.421">tokens be you&apos;re kind of like well that</text><text start="2637.0" dur="2.64">would could really predict what that</text><text start="2638.26" dur="2.64">would look like but you know if you</text><text start="2639.64" dur="3.78">could do your best to someone who&apos;s been</text><text start="2640.9" dur="5.459">on the frontier of of Technology trends</text><text start="2643.42" dur="5.46">like if Luxo in in Universal profiles</text><text start="2646.359" dur="4.081">are are maximally successful what kind</text><text start="2648.88" dur="3.12">of impact do you think that that has on</text><text start="2650.44" dur="3.0">the world you know what is what is the</text><text start="2652.0" dur="3.5">ultimate sort of north star that you&apos;re</text><text start="2653.44" dur="4.26">chasing I don&apos;t know let&apos;s say in</text><text start="2655.5" dur="4.24">2032 if we have you back on the green</text><text start="2657.7" dur="3.899">pill podcast uh what does the world look</text><text start="2659.74" dur="3.359">like at that point I mean on the end</text><text start="2661.599" dur="3.0">this technology these standards will</text><text start="2663.099" dur="3.421">benefit the whole blockchain space at</text><text start="2664.599" dur="3.841">large not just Luxo but Luxo will be the</text><text start="2666.52" dur="4.2">initiator of it</text><text start="2668.44" dur="3.5">um what I see is basically it will</text><text start="2670.72" dur="5.22">completely</text><text start="2671.94" dur="7.24">disrupt society as we function today</text><text start="2675.94" dur="4.86">like on a fundamental basis because you</text><text start="2679.18" dur="4.86">can now self-organize</text><text start="2680.8" dur="5.279">with actual real people that really can</text><text start="2684.04" dur="4.5">use this new technology all that power</text><text start="2686.079" dur="5.101">that web3 gives you of self-organization</text><text start="2688.54" dur="5.22">of like instead of sovereignty and all</text><text start="2691.18" dur="4.439">this now becomes possible and in the</text><text start="2693.76" dur="4.98">hands of everyone</text><text start="2695.619" dur="5.941">and it will change what I see is</text><text start="2698.74" dur="5.16">really like a unification of the world</text><text start="2701.56" dur="4.08">that&apos;s I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s in 10</text><text start="2703.9" dur="5.52">years it&apos;s more like in 20 or something</text><text start="2705.64" dur="6.959">or 30 maybe yeah orders will dissolve</text><text start="2709.42" dur="5.52">power will dissolve how we operate on a</text><text start="2712.599" dur="4.98">global scale how we you know act on</text><text start="2714.94" dur="5.04">issues and decide on things we&apos;re</text><text start="2717.579" dur="4.201">completely massively disrupt you can</text><text start="2719.98" dur="4.44">build you know decentralized Global</text><text start="2721.78" dur="5.039">voting systems you can have actors and</text><text start="2724.42" dur="5.46">dials that own like billions now and can</text><text start="2726.819" dur="5.04">you know act globally on a fully</text><text start="2729.88" dur="5.219">decentralized scale whatever way these</text><text start="2731.859" dur="4.5">people and groups want and it will</text><text start="2735.099" dur="4.201">completely change the game everything</text><text start="2736.359" dur="5.22">will be going hyper Democratic</text><text start="2739.3" dur="5.1">um everything will go very well funded</text><text start="2741.579" dur="4.921">too I mean this the whole world now will</text><text start="2744.4" dur="4.14">actually have a lot of groups that have</text><text start="2746.5" dur="4.8">a lot of very positive impact with a lot</text><text start="2748.54" dur="5.76">of fun funding in all of this old world</text><text start="2751.3" dur="5.46">you know structures where it was so hard</text><text start="2754.3" dur="5.16">to even do an impact</text><text start="2756.76" dur="5.22">um it&apos;s really it will really go to a</text><text start="2759.46" dur="4.02">mass acceleration of everything and on</text><text start="2761.98" dur="3.42">the end it&apos;s up to people what they do</text><text start="2763.48" dur="5.94">with this technology it&apos;s a tool</text><text start="2765.4" dur="6.179">anything could be done and um</text><text start="2769.42" dur="4.5">um and I really hope uh it&apos;s all for the</text><text start="2771.579" dur="6.381">better so we just give people and</text><text start="2773.92" dur="6.78">Humanity a tool of exactly the web 3</text><text start="2777.96" dur="6.159">Tech stack but</text><text start="2780.7" dur="5.76">user friendly and accessible</text><text start="2784.119" dur="5.22">um and that&apos;s going to change everything</text><text start="2786.46" dur="6.96">going forward in the next</text><text start="2789.339" dur="6.181">10 years for sure 20 absolutely</text><text start="2793.42" dur="3.54">all right well if uh if green pill</text><text start="2795.52" dur="4.079">podcast is still around in 10 years</text><text start="2796.96" dur="4.74">we&apos;ll have to have you back in into a</text><text start="2799.599" dur="3.361">review of how it went but um is there</text><text start="2801.7" dur="2.34">anything I didn&apos;t ask that you want to</text><text start="2802.96" dur="3.42">say</text><text start="2804.04" dur="4.14">uh</text><text start="2806.38" dur="3.719">no I think I&apos;m good I mean on the end</text><text start="2808.18" dur="4.26">it&apos;s really it&apos;s a new I mean it&apos;s a new</text><text start="2810.099" dur="5.581">technology it&apos;s a new set of Standards</text><text start="2812.44" dur="4.98">it&apos;s more complex than USA 20. um once</text><text start="2815.68" dur="3.899">you get the concepts it&apos;s actually not</text><text start="2817.42" dur="4.98">really hard to understand it makes a lot</text><text start="2819.579" dur="4.5">of sense yeah it takes a little digging</text><text start="2822.4" dur="3.78">initially</text><text start="2824.079" dur="4.141">um once you use these things it will</text><text start="2826.18" dur="4.32">become more and more clear</text><text start="2828.22" dur="4.2">um it&apos;s unleashing a bit more complex</text><text start="2830.5" dur="3.78">set of standards that are working in</text><text start="2832.42" dur="3.899">concert together</text><text start="2834.28" dur="3.9">um then what we had in the past where</text><text start="2836.319" dur="4.081">somebody comes up with one stand-up</text><text start="2838.18" dur="5.22">proposal and says hey here one smart</text><text start="2840.4" dur="4.679">contract 3 function let&apos;s go and now</text><text start="2843.4" dur="5.1">it&apos;s a bit more complex but it&apos;s</text><text start="2845.079" dur="5.04">actually very modular very extensible</text><text start="2848.5" dur="3.18">very</text><text start="2850.119" dur="5.061">structured but at the same time</text><text start="2851.68" dur="3.5">extremely flexible and</text><text start="2855.4" dur="5.219">I have thought a lot about this stuff on</text><text start="2858.7" dur="3.54">my team and we built this out thought a</text><text start="2860.619" dur="5.521">lot about this we are blown away</text><text start="2862.24" dur="6.06">ourselves every single time of the</text><text start="2866.14" dur="4.38">flexibility in what you could now build</text><text start="2868.3" dur="4.92">like even for us it&apos;s not clear all the</text><text start="2870.52" dur="5.88">stuff that could be built now so</text><text start="2873.22" dur="5.58">I think there would be some years of</text><text start="2876.4" dur="3.54">people really diving into this but it&apos;s</text><text start="2878.8" dur="2.64">going to be very interesting to watch</text><text start="2879.94" dur="3.54">what people build and that&apos;s really what</text><text start="2881.44" dur="4.32">excites me seeing how people will use</text><text start="2883.48" dur="3.119">this and where does always be going and</text><text start="2885.76" dur="4.62">uh</text><text start="2886.599" dur="6.181">yeah it&apos;s probably very crazy</text><text start="2890.38" dur="5.28">so I also want to watch back you know in</text><text start="2892.78" dur="5.16">10 years and I see all the stuff see how</text><text start="2895.66" dur="3.6">right you got it uh through this</text><text start="2897.94" dur="2.22">technology it&apos;s going to be very</text><text start="2899.26" dur="2.76">interesting</text><text start="2900.16" dur="2.939">I mean we&apos;ve seen names of 20 right</text><text start="2902.02" dur="3.36">we&apos;ve seen it with all of the other</text><text start="2903.099" dur="4.141">stuff in the recent years I mean looking</text><text start="2905.38" dur="3.6">back here and it&apos;s crazy if you look at</text><text start="2907.24" dur="5.099">this what happened</text><text start="2908.98" dur="5.82">um it was not totally like that obvious</text><text start="2912.339" dur="4.5">um you know back in the day when we like</text><text start="2914.8" dur="4.74">just came up with it so</text><text start="2916.839" dur="5.641">it would be like this again just</text><text start="2919.54" dur="5.7">massively on a larger scale because you</text><text start="2922.48" dur="4.26">can do a lot more things right a lot</text><text start="2925.24" dur="2.339">more things</text><text start="2926.74" dur="2.579">um</text><text start="2927.579" dur="3.961">because identity is the missing piece</text><text start="2929.319" dur="3.961">really that fundamental piece has been</text><text start="2931.54" dur="3.539">missing in the blockchain space</text><text start="2933.28" dur="5.1">and</text><text start="2935.079" dur="7.981">I do a claim now I solved it but let&apos;s</text><text start="2938.38" dur="6.42">see in a few months and
