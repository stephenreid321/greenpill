dur="4.801">effectively grants around 13 is a way</text><text start="139.599" dur="4.72">for projects to get funding in order to</text><text start="142.4" dur="3.44">advance their their public good that</text><text start="144.319" dur="3.441">they are building and bringing into the</text><text start="145.84" dur="4.32">world and so this is the event that we</text><text start="147.76" dur="4.32">run every three months um grants around</text><text start="150.16" dur="4.0">12 which was our last grants round</text><text start="152.08" dur="4.48">generated over 6 million in public

dur="3.6">we hope to be even bigger and better</text><text start="160.08" dur="3.36">than grants around 12. cool speaking of</text><text start="162.08" dur="3.439">bigger and better what are the what are</text><text start="163.44" dur="3.36">the stats how big is the grants around</text><text start="165.519" dur="3.281">how much money is going to be flowing</text><text start="166.8" dur="4.0">around do we think yeah so we currently</text><text start="168.8" dur="4.64">have three million dollars committed in</text><text start="170.8" dur="5.2">matching funds from our generous</text><text start="173.44" dur="4.96">matching funders so thank you all for</text><text start="176.0" dur="4.48">for coming on board there we&apos;ve got nine</text><text start="178.4" dur="4.16">different ecosystem rounds so different</text><text start="180.48" dur="4.24">web 3 ecosystems that are really looking</text><text start="182.56" dur="3.759">to use public goods funding to build</text><text start="184.72" dur="4.159">their ecosystems and grow their</text><text start="186.319" dur="4.961">communities and in addition we also have</text><text start="188.879" dur="4.881">three cause rounds this time around so</text><text start="191.28" dur="4.56">beyond web 3 we are starting to support</text><text start="193.76" dur="4.96">social causes and we&apos;ve got rounds</text><text start="195.84" dur="5.2">around climate change human longevity</text><text start="198.72" dur="3.92">and also a special round this time</text><text start="201.04" dur="3.279">around for ukraine which we&apos;ll talk a</text><text start="202.64" dur="2.8">little bit more about later</text><text start="204.319" dur="2.401">awesome</text><text start="205.44" dur="3.28">scott i&apos;m wondering if you could take us</text><text start="206.72" dur="4.0">a deep dive on how quadratic funding</text><text start="208.72" dur="4.079">works and why it&apos;s so powerful for</text><text start="210.72" dur="3.76">allocating those millions of dollars in</text><text start="212.799" dur="3.52">matching funding</text><text start="214.48" dur="4.16">absolutely and i think actually what&apos;s</text><text start="216.319" dur="3.681">super important about the way quadratic</text><text start="218.64" dur="2.56">funding works which annika kind of</text><text start="220.0" dur="2.799">mentioned is that it can be used for</text><text start="221.2" dur="3.44">really any cause we don&apos;t need this to</text><text start="222.799" dur="3.36">be something just for web 3 it can be</text><text start="224.64" dur="3.2">something for the world and public kids</text><text start="226.159" dur="3.921">at large and that&apos;s something that i</text><text start="227.84" dur="3.84">think is going to be an increasing theme</text><text start="230.08" dur="4.159">probably even throughout</text><text start="231.68" dur="4.08">uh what we&apos;re talking about today but</text><text start="234.239" dur="3.121">ultimately quadratic funding is just a</text><text start="235.76" dur="3.52">democratic way to allocate a matching</text><text start="237.36" dur="3.12">pool according to the preferences of a</text><text start="239.28" dur="3.039">given community</text><text start="240.48" dur="3.28">so the goal is to understand what do</text><text start="242.319" dur="3.601">people care about and why do they care</text><text start="243.76" dur="4.0">about it and most importantly how much</text><text start="245.92" dur="4.72">do they care about it with their actual</text><text start="247.76" dur="4.399">dollars being a metric for how much is</text><text start="250.64" dur="3.599">actually distributed</text><text start="252.159" dur="3.36">from matching funders so as annika</text><text start="254.239" dur="3.601">mentioned we have three million dollars</text><text start="255.519" dur="6.0">in the pool from a generous group of</text><text start="257.84" dur="5.84">donors we have dns urine uh the ethereum</text><text start="261.519" dur="4.641">foundation has historically been one of</text><text start="263.68" dur="4.64">our largest supporters and a host of</text><text start="266.16" dur="4.8">others including actually even some just</text><text start="268.32" dur="5.28">large anonymous individuals who have</text><text start="270.96" dur="4.72">been willing to donate to our causes and</text><text start="273.6" dur="3.84">to republicans at large and the way it</text><text start="275.68" dur="4.079">works essentially is that you can</text><text start="277.44" dur="4.479">imagine uh over well you won&apos;t have to</text><text start="279.759" dur="4.321">in a second we&apos;ll do this round actually</text><text start="281.919" dur="4.0">over the next two weeks but</text><text start="284.08" dur="3.92">over the two-week period a number of</text><text start="285.919" dur="3.441">people will donate ideally um and</text><text start="288.0" dur="3.68">usually i think it&apos;s in the range of</text><text start="289.36" dur="4.96">anakin correctly around now 50 000 or so</text><text start="291.68" dur="5.04">people um which is honestly staggering</text><text start="294.32" dur="4.64">to me considering uh what we we&apos;re</text><text start="296.72" dur="4.0">looking at in grants around one and two</text><text start="298.96" dur="3.76">but ultimately</text><text start="300.72" dur="4.4">that group is deciding where the</text><text start="302.72" dur="4.88">matching pool funds go so</text><text start="305.12" dur="4.639">basically over those 50 000 donations</text><text start="307.6" dur="4.0">we&apos;re learning effectively what people</text><text start="309.759" dur="3.761">care about and we&apos;re</text><text start="311.6" dur="4.159">kind of like effectively</text><text start="313.52" dur="4.08">donating those funds according to those</text><text start="315.759" dur="3.921">preferences so</text><text start="317.6" dur="3.12">um i&apos;ll pause there but hopefully that</text><text start="319.68" dur="2.72">helps</text><text start="320.72" dur="4.0">i will burst your bubble scott and say</text><text start="322.4" dur="4.0">it was 27 000 unique contributors back</text><text start="324.72" dur="4.4">in gr12 but hopefully we can hit that</text><text start="326.4" dur="4.0">50k number this grants around 13.</text><text start="329.12" dur="2.799">let&apos;s go</text><text start="330.4" dur="3.2">what i think is so cool about quadratic</text><text start="331.919" dur="4.0">funding which is an idea from vitalik</text><text start="333.6" dur="3.76">buter and glenn weil is that the</text><text start="335.919" dur="3.361">preferences of the poor and the many</text><text start="337.36" dur="3.52">matter more than the rich and the few so</text><text start="339.28" dur="3.68">if two grants raised the same amount of</text><text start="340.88" dur="3.599">money but the second grant raised it</text><text start="342.96" dur="3.04">from way more contributors that second</text><text start="344.479" dur="3.201">grant will get way more of the matching</text><text start="346.0" dur="3.919">funds so we&apos;ve built a matching</text><text start="347.68" dur="4.32">algorithm to distribute that three</text><text start="349.919" dur="3.84">million dollars ish based off of the</text><text start="352.0" dur="4.479">preferences of the little people in the</text><text start="353.759" dur="4.081">ecosystem relative to bag size so i</text><text start="356.479" dur="3.681">think that&apos;s what is really exciting</text><text start="357.84" dur="4.32">about quadratic funding to me</text><text start="360.16" dur="4.159">um how can we use quad so say you&apos;re a</text><text start="362.16" dur="3.92">d5 founder nft founder or founder</text><text start="364.319" dur="4.32">working on a project in the space how</text><text start="366.08" dur="4.48">can you leverage grants round 13 in</text><text start="368.639" dur="4.161">order to get funding for your project</text><text start="370.56" dur="4.24">yeah and on the grantee side so in order</text><text start="372.8" dur="4.959">to get funding you can go to get coin</text><text start="374.8" dur="4.959">dot co slash grants and click on the</text><text start="377.759" dur="3.601">application there&apos;s a grant application</text><text start="379.759" dur="3.44">you can walk through it&apos;s pretty</text><text start="381.36" dur="3.839">straightforward much simpler than your</text><text start="383.199" dur="3.28">typical charity grant application for</text><text start="385.199" dur="4.321">those of you who are familiar with the</text><text start="386.479" dur="5.121">not for profit space um but go on there</text><text start="389.52" dur="4.48">check out the eligibility policies for</text><text start="391.6" dur="4.159">the different rounds uh and apply for a</text><text start="394.0" dur="3.84">grant and it&apos;s definitely not too late</text><text start="395.759" dur="4.241">to apply for grants around 13 there&apos;s</text><text start="397.84" dur="4.479">still lots of time so on the grantee</text><text start="400.0" dur="4.56">side that is where to get started</text><text start="402.319" dur="3.841">if you are a project that is looking to</text><text start="404.56" dur="3.6">build your ecosystem and grow your</text><text start="406.16" dur="3.68">community and give back to public goods</text><text start="408.16" dur="4.0">generally speaking you can also come on</text><text start="409.84" dur="4.079">board as a matching funder it&apos;s not too</text><text start="412.16" dur="3.68">late for that either so definitely reach</text><text start="413.919" dur="3.921">out to us if that&apos;s of interest and</text><text start="415.84" dur="3.759">finally if you&apos;re just you know a web 3</text><text start="417.84" dur="3.759">citizen like like all of us and</text><text start="419.599" dur="4.481">interested in you know seeing certain</text><text start="421.599" dur="4.481">projects advance definitely you know</text><text start="424.08" dur="4.32">exercise your your vote in quadratic</text><text start="426.08" dur="4.239">funding so as scott mentioned quadratic</text><text start="428.4" dur="3.359">funding is effectively voting with your</text><text start="430.319" dur="3.361">dollars on where you want to see the</text><text start="431.759" dur="4.0">matching pool funds go across all of</text><text start="433.68" dur="4.48">these thousands of projects so</text><text start="435.759" dur="4.241">definitely go to get coin.com grants</text><text start="438.16" dur="3.84">browse through the interview interface</text><text start="440.0" dur="3.759">see what&apos;s there and contribute to</text><text start="442.0" dur="4.479">public goods because public goods are</text><text start="443.759" dur="5.361">good public goods are good so speaking</text><text start="446.479" dur="5.28">of the grants around 13 round i&apos;m</text><text start="449.12" dur="5.519">noticing that we&apos;ve kind of grown</text><text start="451.759" dur="5.521">the main round the ethereum round</text><text start="454.639" dur="4.641">vertically over the the first couple</text><text start="457.28" dur="4.16">rounds of bitcoin grants and now we&apos;re</text><text start="459.28" dur="6.319">expanding out into doing</text><text start="461.44" dur="6.879">d5 ecosystem rounds and uh longevity</text><text start="465.599" dur="5.521">rounds and climate change rounds and the</text><text start="468.319" dur="4.481">one that that piqued my interest here is</text><text start="471.12" dur="3.759">the growth of a ukraine round which is</text><text start="472.8" dur="3.44">obviously a very hot topic right now can</text><text start="474.879" dur="2.641">we talk a little bit about the ukraine</text><text start="476.24" dur="2.72">round and what kind of grants are going</text><text start="477.52" dur="4.079">to be in that what those funds can be</text><text start="478.96" dur="5.04">used for yeah absolutely so the ukraine</text><text start="481.599" dur="4.88">round arose actually out of an immediate</text><text start="484.0" dur="4.56">need and i think anyone listening uh is</text><text start="486.479" dur="4.56">probably familiar with the crisis that&apos;s</text><text start="488.56" dur="3.6">arisen there over the past few it feels</text><text start="491.039" dur="2.72">like months but actually i think it&apos;s</text><text start="492.16" dur="4.24">even a little bit less time than that</text><text start="493.759" dur="4.081">since everything sort of emerged and</text><text start="496.4" dur="3.68">we had a lot of matching funders reach</text><text start="497.84" dur="4.24">out to us figuring out you know</text><text start="500.08" dur="3.92">they want to support effectively as much</text><text start="502.08" dur="2.799">as they can and i think everyone does</text><text start="504.0" dur="2.319">right now</text><text start="504.879" dur="3.201">um and they wanted to figure out what</text><text start="506.319" dur="4.32">the most effective way was to do that</text><text start="508.08" dur="4.0">and ultimately we decided that based on</text><text start="510.639" dur="3.361">what we&apos;d seen with other projects we&apos;ve</text><text start="512.08" dur="3.199">worked with um i personally have been</text><text start="514.0" dur="3.039">helping a little bit with unchained fund</text><text start="515.279" dur="4.24">i know other folks have been helping out</text><text start="517.039" dur="4.081">with things like ukraine dow we wanted</text><text start="519.519" dur="4.08">to figure out how we can rally the</text><text start="521.12" dur="4.719">bitcoin community towards projects that</text><text start="523.599" dur="4.8">are effectively on the ground doing work</text><text start="525.839" dur="3.44">directly around humanitarian aid and</text><text start="528.399" dur="3.44">around</text><text start="529.279" dur="5.12">journalistic freedom uh in this in this</text><text start="531.839" dur="4.401">case so we have a number of projects</text><text start="534.399" dur="3.12">that are specifically from groups like</text><text start="536.24" dur="3.12">the giving block who have been doing</text><text start="537.519" dur="4.721">really great work towards this cause</text><text start="539.36" dur="4.88">over the last uh even i&apos;d say</text><text start="542.24" dur="3.76">you know six months to a year</text><text start="544.24" dur="3.52">on the ground in various regions and we</text><text start="546.0" dur="3.839">have another group of projects from</text><text start="547.76" dur="3.6">endowment which i would shout out to as</text><text start="549.839" dur="2.401">a very kind of cool</text><text start="551.36" dur="3.28">uh</text><text start="552.24" dur="3.76">i guess almost fiscal host for a lot of</text><text start="554.64" dur="2.08">these projects</text><text start="556.0" dur="2.72">the</text><text start="556.72" dur="3.76">other groups of projects are actually on</text><text start="558.72" dur="4.559">the ground emergent projects that arose</text><text start="560.48" dur="5.2">from the crypto ecosystem directly so</text><text start="563.279" dur="4.321">ukraine dao being one of those on chain</text><text start="565.68" dur="4.32">fund being one of those and again our</text><text start="567.6" dur="5.04">focus is on non-military</text><text start="570.0" dur="5.04">uh humanitarian aid instead of focusing</text><text start="572.64" dur="4.639">on sort of what

start="638.48" dur="4.479">with a single line of solidity code so</text><text start="641.04" dur="3.6">it essentially allows you to solve for</text><text start="642.959" dur="4.0">two things one is

dur="4.32">ecosystem</text><text start="650.399" dur="4.641">we&apos;re really excited that tally has</text><text start="653.279" dur="4.161">decided to partner up with us and become</text><text

is like community</text><text start="662.56" dur="4.32">owned and that value is very important</text><text start="664.399" dur="5.041">to them and so they&apos;ve instantiated this</text><text start="666.88" dur="4.959">aqueduct um even prior to the formation</text><text start="669.44" dur="3.92">of their token and of their doubt</text><text start="671.839" dur="3.201">all right very cool so one of the things</text><text start="673.36" dur="4.08">i think is really neat is how as</text><text start="675.04" dur="4.72">quadratic funding grows how the matching</text><text start="677.44" dur="5.44">pool kind of just stacks as more and</text><text start="679.76" dur="5.92">more causes and ecosystems are added to</text><text start="682.88" dur="5.6">get coin and we&apos;ve seen that on bitcoin</text><text start="685.68" dur="5.2">grants because of quadratic funding the</text><text start="688.48" dur="4.16">um like a one dollar contribution can be</text><text start="690.88" dur="3.92">worth a hundred dollars in matching coin</text><text start="692.64" dur="3.84">center even had a thousand dollars in</text><text start="694.8" dur="3.2">matching for a one dollar contribution</text><text start="696.48" dur="3.28">because of quadratic funding and i think</text><text start="698.0" dur="4.959">that&apos;s because in grants around 12 it</text><text start="699.76" dur="4.8">was in the the the main round and it was</text><text start="702.959" dur="4.241">also in one of the side rounds at once</text><text start="704.56" dur="5.279">so we saw this kind of like effect where</text><text start="707.2" dur="4.16">one round is like a crypto economic is</text><text start="709.839" dur="3.361">like a fan that creates a force for</text><text start="711.36" dur="3.039">funding public goods but when you stack</text><text start="713.2" dur="3.199">the rounds on top of each other it&apos;s</text><text start="714.399" dur="3.921">like a jet engine that creates this</text><text start="716.399" dur="4.321">insane matching multiple and so you&apos;re</text><text start="718.32" dur="3.12">saying that founders can email founders</text><text start="720.72" dur="2.96">at</text><text start="721.44" dur="4.24">founders of of projects can email</text><text start="723.68" dur="3.36">founders at getcoin.co and get hooked up</text><text

partners are</text><text start="730.88" dur="4.72">looking to create an aqueduct in order</text><text start="732.72" dur="5.2">to automate their public goods funding</text><text start="735.6" dur="4.72">going forward and plan it into</text><text start="737.92" dur="4.159">their their general quarterly rounds</text><text start="740.32" dur="3.84">they can go ahead and email us

dur="2.961">coin i want to talk zoom out a little</text><text start="753.68" dur="2.8">bit and i want to talk a little bit</text><text start="754.8" dur="3.599">about the mission of get coin what is</text><text start="756.48" dur="4.32">git coin why do we run these rounds what</text><text start="758.399" dur="4.081">do we believe that causes us to</text><text start="760.8" dur="4.4">work on this insane quadratic funding</text><text start="762.48" dur="3.52">formula and to organize these rounds</text><text start="765.2" dur="2.48">so</text><text start="766.0" dur="3.519">uh i guess i&apos;ll just i&apos;ll just</text><text start="767.68" dur="3.68">ask this what is the mission of bitcoin</text><text start="769.519" dur="3.921">and how does it drive what we do i i</text><text start="771.36" dur="3.44">feel like it&apos;s actually being the</text><text start="773.44" dur="3.44">central point the north star of what</text><text start="774.8" dur="3.44">we&apos;ve done for so long and it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="776.88" dur="3.04">amazing because when you look at a lot</text><text start="778.24" dur="3.279">of organizations as they shift towards</text><text start="779.92" dur="3.599">dows they</text><text start="781.519" dur="4.641">often change there&apos;s often changes in</text><text start="783.519" dur="4.161">priorities changes in uh sort of focus</text><text start="786.16" dur="3.679">and i think we&apos;ve always been focused on</text><text start="787.68" dur="4.48">impact and focused on trying to grow and</text><text start="789.839" dur="4.8">sustain public goods throughout web 3 to</text><text start="792.16" dur="4.32">start admittedly and now of course kind</text><text start="794.639" dur="4.64">of expanding into republicans in the</text><text start="796.48" dur="4.72">real world uh the physical world as well</text><text start="799.279" dur="4.481">and that sort of mission of growing and</text><text start="801.2" dur="4.56">sustaining uh public goods especially</text><text start="803.76" dur="4.879">digital public kids has been sort of a</text><text start="805.76" dur="5.519">center point in this larger picture</text><text start="808.639" dur="4.64">of creating impact and i actually think</text><text start="811.279" dur="3.841">you&apos;ve done a really good job of framing</text><text start="813.279" dur="3.761">what it is that we mean by impact and</text><text start="815.12" dur="3.839">what it means for a dow to be kind of an</text><text start="817.04" dur="4.32">impact dow and i would highly recommend</text><text start="818.959" dur="4.481">actually people check out a post on the</text><text start="821.36" dur="4.4">bitcoin forum gov.goodcoin.com that kind</text><text start="823.44" dur="4.399">of goes through some of these pieces</text><text start="825.76" dur="4.56">in terms of what it means to create</text><text start="827.839" dur="3.601">impact and how we can actually kind

way</text><text start="864.88" dur="3.92">i think is really important because it&apos;s</text><text start="866.959" dur="4.0">actually and it&apos;s very timely in the</text><text start="868.8" dur="3.44">context of the the situation in ukraine</text><text start="870.959" dur="2.641">it&apos;s something we&apos;ve seen</text><text start="872.24" dur="3.76">nation states and these even</text><text start="873.6" dur="4.56">supernational bodies fail to do for so</text><text start="876.0" dur="3.44">long and that&apos;s that&apos;s actually kind of</text><text start="878.16" dur="3.44">coming to a head now with crypto</text><text start="879.44" dur="3.839">donations to ukraine in the context of</text><text start="881.6" dur="4.08">uh crypto actually in many

dur="4.24">the real world and</text><text start="890.0" dur="5.199">it&apos;s actually something that um to me</text><text start="892.639" dur="4.32">makes me very optimistic for the

dur="4.721">that sort of framing of things but we</text><text start="901.839" dur="4.401">have these global coordination tools and</text><text start="904.24" dur="4.8">i think it&apos;s possible for us to</text><text start="906.24" dur="4.32">look at sort of this you know kind of</text><text start="909.04" dur="3.039">kernel the mission of growing and</text><text start="910.56" dur="3.279">sustaining open source software and</text><text start="912.079" dur="4.241">digital public goods and how that&apos;s</text><text start="913.839" dur="4.56">blossomed into this broader vision of</text><text start="916.32" dur="4.8">impact across these different</text><text start="918.399" dur="4.24">pluralistic you know overlapping circles</text><text start="921.12" dur="2.719">or communities sort of as as you called</text><text start="922.639" dur="2.401">them</text><text start="923.839" dur="2.721">and it&apos;s really interesting just to see</text><text start="925.04" dur="3.039">how that&apos;s sort of</text><text start="926.56" dur="3.199">been a</text><text start="928.079" dur="2.88">its own sort of way to solve global</text><text start="929.759" dur="3.921">coordination problems in a way that</text><text start="930.959" dur="4.8">wasn&apos;t possible uh before so</text><text start="933.68" dur="4.159">yeah i&apos;ll pause there but i think that&apos;s</text><text start="935.759" dur="4.561">a really important kind of</text><text start="937.839" dur="4.481">mission and i&apos;m glad to be supporting it</text><text start="940.32" dur="5.6">so we started off funding open source</text><text start="942.32" dur="6.319">software and have since diversified into</text><text start="945.92" dur="4.8">a more pluralistic view of public goods</text><text start="948.639" dur="4.081">all sort of public goods are good and</text><text start="950.72" dur="3.6">luckily quadratic funding which worked</text><text start="952.72" dur="3.6">on open source works in all these other</text><text start="954.32" dur="3.28">ecosystems and one of the things that i</text><text start="956.32" dur="2.879">think that we&apos;ve really been trying to</text><text start="957.6" dur="3.359">design and to get coin from the start is</text><text start="959.199" dur="2.88">to be a channel where greater</text><text start="960.959"

of</text><text start="976.399" dur="3.12">the reason why we&apos;re doing this episode</text><text start="977.68" dur="3.279">on bankless and on greenpild is to get</text><text start="979.519"

is important in how</text><text start="1008.959" dur="2.961">bitcoin is governed</text><text start="1010.48" dur="3.12">yeah absolutely and i&apos;d love to hear</text><text start="1011.92" dur="3.2">actually annika&apos;s take specifically on</text><text start="1013.6" dur="3.599">sort of the public goods funding</text><text start="1015.12" dur="4.639">workstream&apos;s role in this but my view</text><text start="1017.199" dur="3.921">just very quickly is that ultimately the</text><text start="1019.759" dur="3.2">dow is</text><text start="1021.12" dur="3.6">in a sense this kind of

dur="3.52">right now sort of under one banner but</text><text start="1028.24" dur="4.48">increasingly under a constellation of</text><text start="1030.319" dur="4.321">banners to push forward this

north</text><text start="1054.08" dur="3.28">star mission ideally in my view the</text><text start="1056.32" dur="2.4">mission is actually a key part there&apos;s</text><text start="1057.36" dur="3.92">lots of doubts that like don&apos;t have a</text><text start="1058.72" dur="4.88">key mission and i think those will tend</text><text start="1061.28" dur="3.92">to over time do worse than

start="1279.679" dur="3.761">the grants part of the company into the</text><text start="1281.44" dur="4.32">dow and then turning our centralized</text><text start="1283.44" dur="5.04">platform into a protocol</text><text start="1285.76" dur="5.52">so um i want to end by talking a little</text><text start="1288.48" dur="4.4">bit about grant&apos;s 2.0 and our vision to</text><text start="1291.28" dur="3.12">turn bitcoin grants into a credibly</text><text start="1292.88" dur="3.52">neutral protocol</text><text start="1294.4" dur="4.0">and the decentralization i think that&apos;s</text><text start="1296.4" dur="4.24">the kind of like feather in our cap when</text><text start="1298.4" dur="5.12">it comes to really becoming a doubt and</text><text start="1300.64" dur="5.2">becoming decentralized so kevin olsen</text><text start="1303.52" dur="5.44">and lindsay thrift uh what is grant&apos;s</text><text start="1305.84" dur="6.4">2.0 and why is it important</text><text start="1308.96" dur="6.64">yeah what is grants 2.0 um well it&apos;s the</text><text start="1312.24" dur="3.36">version that came after grants</text><text start="1316.84" dur="3.88">1.00 that&apos;s to say that the centralized</text><text start="1319.28" dur="4.16">version of grants that we&apos;re running on</text><text start="1320.72" dur="4.64">today um served the purposes we needed</text><text start="1323.44" dur="4.0">at the time when we were figuring out</text><text start="1325.36" dur="3.84">was there a space for quadratic funding</text><text start="1327.44" dur="3.52">where people are going to use this you</text><text start="1329.2" dur="3.44">mentioned at the beginning</text><text start="1330.96" dur="3.68">that vertical scaling that we went</text><text start="1332.64" dur="3.84">through of the main round</text><text start="1334.64" dur="3.279">and now we&apos;ve had multiple rounds to</text><text start="1336.48" dur="3.199">test out what we&apos;ve kind of been</text><text start="1337.919" dur="3.601">referring to as horizontal scaling but</text><text start="1339.679" dur="4.24">the testing of all these other rounds</text><text start="1341.52" dur="4.72">now with tally coming on and aqueduct</text><text start="1343.919" dur="5.361">it&apos;s super clear to us that there um is</text><text start="1346.24" dur="4.319">an appetite to run your own rounds to to</text><text start="1349.28" dur="3.12">really like</text><text start="1350.559" dur="3.36">hold the future of your own ecosystem</text><text start="1352.4" dur="4.159">and project in your hands and be able to</text><text start="1353.919" dur="5.281">continuously fund and grow that um and</text><text start="1356.559" dur="5.921">very simply grants 1.0 the first</text><text start="1359.2" dur="4.479">centralized version doesn&apos;t serve um the</text><text start="1362.48" dur="2.8">purpose of giving everyone the</text><text start="1363.679" dur="3.681">sovereignty they need to run the rounds</text><text start="1365.28" dur="5.68">for their programs and to scale over</text><text start="1367.36" dur="5.36">time so grants 2.0 is our vision to take</text><text start="1370.96" dur="3.44">quadratic funding and really just public</text><text start="1372.72" dur="3.92">goods funding like we&apos;re using quadratic</text><text start="1374.4" dur="4.88">funding today but there&apos;s multiple other</text><text start="1376.64" dur="4.96">mechanisms existing and emerging that</text><text start="1379.28" dur="3.12">you could use to allocate funds as well</text><text start="1381.6" dur="2.72">so</text><text start="1382.4" dur="4.56">it&apos;s our vision for taking public goods</text><text start="1384.32" dur="4.96">funding to the world where there&apos;s</text><text start="1386.96" dur="4.8">thousands of run rounds running at any</text><text start="1389.28" dur="4.72">time um and it&apos;s really us going from</text><text start="1391.76" dur="3.279">fishing for you giving you a fish um</text><text start="1394.0" dur="2.559">here&apos;s what you need to start your</text><text start="1395.039" dur="2.961">project looks like you scaled let&apos;s give</text><text start="1396.559" dur="2.641">you three fish to actually just teaching</text><text start="1398.0" dur="2.64">you to fish</text><text start="1399.2" dur="2.56">equipping you with all the tools that</text><text start="1400.64" dur="3.84">you need</text><text start="1401.76" dur="5.36">so we&apos;re taking our current product we</text><text start="1404.48" dur="4.559">spent the last three four months or so</text><text start="1407.12" dur="3.439">really going deep on what exists there</text><text start="1409.039" dur="3.281">today what&apos;s the problem statements</text><text start="1410.559" dur="4.721">we&apos;re solving for what are the domains</text><text start="1412.32" dur="4.719">that have emerged within that product</text><text start="1415.28" dur="3.92">and what goes with us into the future</text><text start="1417.039" dur="3.841">and into the decentralized future so</text><text start="1419.2" dur="3.52">we&apos;re headed down a path where we&apos;ll</text><text start="1420.88" dur="3.2">have a decentralized protocol that&apos;s</text><text start="1422.72" dur="3.36">composed</text><text start="1424.08" dur="3.199">of a few different components which</text><text start="1426.08" dur="2.24">we&apos;ll get into</text><text start="1427.279" dur="2.961">in a bit</text><text start="1428.32" dur="4.4">but the spirit of us we want to be fully</text><text start="1430.24" dur="4.4">open source build in a way that</text><text start="1432.72" dur="4.48">marketplace can emerge there can be</text><text start="1434.64" dur="4.399">plug-ins for different mechanisms</text><text start="1437.2" dur="3.599">you can choose how you govern your own</text><text start="1439.039" dur="3.441">rounds bitcoin will have opinions about</text><text start="1440.799" dur="3.36">how we govern ours</text><text start="1442.48" dur="3.92">but that will continue to expand and</text><text start="1444.159" dur="3.601">grow over time um so i don&apos;t want to</text><text start="1446.4" dur="3.6">steal too much of the thunder kevin</text><text start="1447.76" dur="3.84">olsen has been a fantastic partner in us</text><text start="1450.0" dur="2.559">figuring out what&apos;s this architecture</text><text start="1451.6" dur="2.16">look like</text><text start="1452.559" dur="2.961">but that&apos;s our vision let&apos;s be</text><text start="1453.76" dur="3.36">decentralized let&apos;s give everyone the</text><text start="1455.52" dur="3.12">tools they need to run and govern their</text><text start="1457.12" dur="4.48">own rounds</text><text start="1458.64" dur="6.72">great kevin kevin olsen first off cool</text><text start="1461.6" dur="5.36">name ko uh second off what&apos;s grant&apos;s 2.0</text><text start="1465.36" dur="4.16">oh man i mean</text><text start="1466.96" dur="4.48">lindsay that was amazing well done</text><text start="1469.52" dur="3.759">um so it&apos;s it&apos;s gonna be a couple things</text><text start="1471.44" dur="3.68">right so the first thing we&apos;re starting</text><text start="1473.279" dur="3.601">off with is figuring out decentralized</text><text start="1475.12" dur="3.76">identity right and proof of personhood</text><text start="1476.88" dur="3.679">so we&apos;re gonna start off with d-pop</text><text start="1478.88" dur="4.08">that&apos;s gonna be our first component that</text><text start="1480.559" dur="4.161">we&apos;re we&apos;re going into um and we&apos;re</text><text start="1482.96" dur="4.4">really excited uh kicking that off like</text><text start="1484.72" dur="4.64">next week uh so you know no pressure uh</text><text start="1487.36" dur="3.36">getting going um</text><text start="1489.36" dur="2.72">and then beyond that we&apos;re with like</text><text start="1490.72" dur="2.88">these domains that lindsay was talking</text><text start="1492.08" dur="4.079">about we&apos;re getting into</text><text start="1493.6" dur="4.72">um kind of the the components we take to</text><text start="1496.159" dur="4.0">run around right so we&apos;re getting into</text><text start="1498.32" dur="4.4">like where a grant publisher is sort of</text><text start="1500.159" dur="4.721">the self-sovereign person you build a</text><text start="1502.72" dur="4.079">grant you publish that out onto a</text><text start="1504.88" dur="3.6">decentralized data layer right we&apos;re</text><text start="1506.799" dur="4.081">still investigating exactly what that</text><text start="1508.48" dur="4.16">looks like um but then we&apos;re building on</text><text start="1510.88" dur="3.44">top of that all of the operations that</text><text start="1512.64" dur="3.36">we bring to bear and making sure that</text><text start="1514.32" dur="3.28">our partners can take that on themselves</text><text start="1516.0" dur="3.36">the round manager</text><text start="1517.6" dur="3.84">and then lastly for the public the grant</text><text start="1519.36" dur="4.96">explorer experience is something that</text><text start="1521.44" dur="5.44">again the round uh owners will be able</text><text start="1524.32" dur="4.56">to kind of customize and uh tailor to</text><text start="1526.88" dur="3.679">their needs so we&apos;re really envisioning</text><text start="1528.88" dur="4.24">kind of this end-to-end</text><text start="1530.559" dur="5.6">um what it takes to run around</text><text start="1533.12" dur="5.36">to fund it to make that available to a</text><text start="1536.159" dur="3.361">community and then for folks to explore</text><text start="1538.48" dur="4.0">those</text><text start="1539.52" dur="4.48">and then also to fund them i think a big</text><text start="1542.48" dur="3.36">part of that that i&apos;m excited about to</text><text start="1544.0" dur="4.159">make sure we highlight is that we&apos;re</text><text start="1545.84" dur="4.319">really doubling down on the actors in</text><text start="1548.159" dur="4.88">the grants ecosystem right there&apos;s like</text><text start="1550.159" dur="4.961">i am a grantee i own my project</text><text start="1553.039" dur="3.361">and by having the grants publisher be</text><text start="1555.12" dur="3.439">its own</text><text start="1556.4" dur="3.92">part of this ecosystem you can take that</text><text start="1558.559" dur="3.441">from round to round</text><text start="1560.32" dur="3.28">you can take your project to any realm</text><text start="1562.0" dur="3.12">that&apos;s aligned to the vision and mission</text><text start="1563.6" dur="3.439">of your project</text><text start="1565.12" dur="4.32">and source funding there so today it&apos;s</text><text start="1567.039" dur="4.801">stacked in our centralized system</text><text start="1569.44" dur="4.479">but it should stack and spread over time</text><text start="1571.84" dur="4.079">as these rounds scale and then same for</text><text start="1573.919" dur="3.681">round manager if you&apos;re a dow that&apos;s</text><text start="1575.919" dur="2.801">looking to spin up your own grants</text><text start="1577.6" dur="2.64">program</text><text start="1578.72" dur="3.199">you will be able to decide what</text><text start="1580.24" dur="4.16">mechanisms you use for choosing</text><text start="1581.919" dur="4.88">eligibility what&apos;s important and to the</text><text start="1584.4" dur="3.68">values of your of your community how do</text><text start="1586.799" dur="3.041">you want to do

dur="3.679">your ecosystem and then how do you</text><text start="1606.88" dur="4.08">decide who&apos;s eligible who gets to</text><text start="1608.559" dur="3.761">participate in that decision

2.0</text><text start="1660.399" dur="5.041">anything else to say about grants 2.0</text><text start="1663.6" dur="3.199">no man just excited it&apos;s going to be a</text><text start="1665.44" dur="3.28">really exciting journey getting to meet</text><text start="1666.799" dur="3.921">a lot of the ecosystem you know so if</text><text start="1668.72" dur="4.0">you&apos;re interested come talk to us i mean</text><text start="1670.72" dur="3.52">we have so many people who are building</text><text start="1672.72" dur="5.36">in similar spaces we want to learn from</text><text start="1674.24" dur="3.84">you um you know get in touch</text><text start="1678.399" dur="3.601">cool i would love to just step in and</text><text start="1679.919" dur="4.081">just kind of highlight some of the power</text><text start="1682.0" dur="4.24">i see in grants 2.0 as lindsay and kevin</text><text start="1684.0" dur="4.08">articulated it like there has not been</text><text start="1686.24" dur="3.76">anything like this before as a grantee</text><text start="1688.08" dur="3.52">right so just very tactically like let&apos;s</text><text start="1690.0" dur="3.279">say you&apos;re building a really early stage</text><text start="1691.6" dur="3.6">d5 project and you want to get grant</text><text start="1693.279" dur="3.921">funding right now you would probably go</text><text start="1695.2" dur="4.24">out to 15 different grant programs and</text><text start="1697.2" dur="4.24">submit 15 different grant applications</text><text start="1699.44" dur="4.16">what the idea of what lindsay and kevin</text><text start="1701.44" dur="4.08">articulated is you could just do one</text><text start="1703.6" dur="3.84">grant application and automatically be</text><text start="1705.52" dur="3.36">routed to all of these different grants</text><text start="1707.44" dur="3.52">rounds that you might be eligible for</text><text start="1708.88" dur="4.96">whether uniswop wants to fund your grant</text><text start="1710.96" dur="4.56">polygon coinbase etc etc um so to me the</text><text start="1713.84" dur="3.52">power here in kind of the protocol and</text><text start="1715.52" dur="3.36">the standardization from a grantee</text><text start="1717.36" dur="3.28">perspective is just massive and i think</text><text start="1718.88" dur="3.84">in the context of you know charity</text><text start="1720.64" dur="3.759">funding grant funding ngos you know all</text><text start="1722.72" dur="2.88">of all of kind of the structures there i</text><text start="1724.399" dur="3.681">don&apos;t think we&apos;ve seen anything quite</text><text start="1725.6" dur="4.079">like this so um major shout out to what</text><text start="1728.08" dur="2.719">you&apos;re building here</text><text start="1729.679" dur="2.801">yeah super exciting</text><text start="1730.799" dur="3.921">there&apos;s an amazing actually just very</text><text start="1732.48" dur="3.679">quick analogy that i heard which is that</text><text start="1734.72" dur="3.6">the ecosystem rounds are kind of the</text><text start="1736.159" dur="3.841">bays and the main pool and the main</text><text start="1738.32" dur="2.959">round that we&apos;re running is the ocean</text><text start="1740.0" dur="3.6">and you can just imagine that these</text><text start="1741.279" dur="4.321">things all eventually flow back to this</text><text start="1743.6" dur="4.0">larger pool i just think it&apos;s like</text><text start="1745.6" dur="4.24">really kind of beautiful to think about</text><text start="1747.6" dur="3.679">the way in which this is kind of its own</text><text start="1749.84" dur="2.719">like when we say ecosystem i think we</text><text start="1751.279" dur="4.321">often think mechanically but it is</text><text start="1752.559" dur="4.561">really almost in a ecological sense kind</text><text start="1755.6" dur="3.36">of an ecosystem</text><text start="1757.12" dur="4.24">my cellular almost network of projects</text><text start="1758.96" dur="3.92">that are coming together um</text><text start="1761.36" dur="3.52">just awesome john i saw you were going</text><text start="1762.88" dur="3.6">to jump in sorry about that yeah i also</text><text start="1764.88" dur="3.6">wanted to stress just one thing just to</text><text start="1766.48" dur="4.799">contextualize where we are i think in</text><text start="1768.48" dur="4.48">this funding journey like it&apos;s you know</text><text start="1771.279" dur="4.0">most people it&apos;s not the first thing</text><text start="1772.96" dur="4.24">that they do that they join web 3 and</text><text start="1775.279" dur="4.241">they start funding public goods this is</text><text start="1777.2" dur="5.359">still a fairly niche thing in the last</text><text start="1779.52" dur="5.039">round we had 26 000 people um donate</text><text start="1782.559" dur="4.561">which is incredible but there&apos;s over 21</text><text start="1784.559" dur="4.401">million metamask wallets right now so</text><text start="1787.12" dur="4.159">right it&apos;s still a very very small</text><text start="1788.96" dur="4.56">percentage so i think what&apos;s critical is</text><text start="1791.279" dur="4.64">that everyone who does donate and who</text><text start="1793.52" dur="4.32">has done this in the past talks to a few</text><text start="1795.919" dur="3.841">of their friends about it right not just</text><text start="1797.84" dur="4.16">your crypto friends but also some others</text><text start="1799.76" dur="4.56">i would love to see a day when when we</text><text start="1802.0" dur="5.6">have people getting a wallet in order to</text><text start="1804.32" dur="4.8">fund and support public goods</text><text start="1807.6" dur="4.24">all right scott you gave me an idea</text><text start="1809.12" dur="4.4">grants uh grants 2.0 launch party near</text><text start="1811.84" dur="4.079">the ocean just to hit home that</text><text start="1813.52" dur="4.159">ecosystem metaphor</text><text start="1815.919" dur="3.76">you guys know i&apos;m partial to mountains</text><text start="1817.679" dur="3.921">but we can go to a beach for this</text><text start="1819.679" dur="3.441">all right is there anything that i</text><text start="1821.6" dur="3.6">didn&apos;t ask that you all want to say</text><text start="1823.12" dur="4.4">about grants around 13 git coin grants</text><text start="1825.2" dur="3.839">and if not we can start to rap maybe the</text><text start="1827.52" dur="3.2">only thing i would quickly mention is</text><text start="1829.039" dur="3.52">that we kind of talked about the dow and</text><text start="1830.72" dur="3.28">i think we talked about the idea of</text><text start="1832.559" dur="3.12">people getting involved but if you</text><text start="1834.0" dur="4.159">really practically do want to help with</text><text start="1835.679" dur="3.6">this mission if you want to see how sort</text><text start="1838.159" dur="3.601">of everything</text><text start="1839.279" dur="3.28">works internally and is made i think</text><text start="1841.76"
