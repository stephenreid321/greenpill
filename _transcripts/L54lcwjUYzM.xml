that</text><text start="598.48" dur="3.68">make it up it&apos;s like there is this like</text><text start="600.56" dur="3.519">you know collective human species that</text><text start="602.16" dur="4.0">was rolling around right and it kind of</text><text start="604.079" dur="4.401">got infected by cordyceps something like</text><text start="606.16" dur="3.2">cordyceps cordyceps is a is a

start="626.56" dur="4.24">mind control thing but it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="628.48" dur="3.68">we got we got incepted by our own</text><text start="630.8" dur="2.8">cordyceps which was the notion of</text><text start="632.16" dur="3.52">property and money</text><text start="633.6" dur="4.88">and and what that did was it took this</text><text start="635.68" dur="4.56">human organism and it took over its mind</text><text start="638.48" dur="4.4">and it made it spread out through the</text><text start="640.24" dur="5.36">entire world because</text><text start="642.88"

dur="4.24">coordinate i want to ground it with the</text><text start="684.0" dur="5.519">what you do and then we&apos;ll get back</text><text start="686.16" dur="5.44">we&apos;ll we&apos;ll we&apos;ll lift off back into the</text><text start="689.519" dur="3.44">um into the theory and what i love about</text><text start="691.6" dur="3.44">you is that you have such a deep</text><text start="692.959" dur="4.481">practice and a deep theory we can go</text><text start="695.04" dur="5.12">empirical and we can go a priori in this</text><text start="697.44" dur="5.519">conversation so yearn uh is one of the</text><text start="700.16" dur="4.64">most successful yield aggregators in the</text><text start="702.959" dur="5.281">world started by andre</text><text start="704.8" dur="6.8">andre and um who then kind of</text><text start="708.24" dur="4.88">left did a fair launch and then a dow</text><text start="711.6" dur="3.039">formed around him and he said i don&apos;t</text><text start="713.12" dur="5.68">want to be the leader of this and so</text><text start="714.639" dur="6.161">other leaders have emerged um and you&apos;re</text><text start="718.8" dur="3.52">in the middle of that and you developed</text><text start="720.8" dur="4.08">this tool called coordinate without</text><text start="722.32" dur="4.639">which i would call a tool for gathering</text><text start="724.88" dur="4.24">inter-subjective consensus of who is</text><text start="726.959" dur="4.56">contributing uh in which your peers</text><text start="729.12" dur="3.92">decide who&apos;s contributing and who&apos;s not</text><text start="731.519" dur="3.921">and then you can like people can drop</text><text start="733.04" dur="4.799">tokens on on top of that so</text><text start="735.44" dur="4.0">that&apos;s my sort of like tl dr</text><text start="737.839" dur="3.281">of</text><text start="739.44" dur="2.8">york like where you&apos;ve been in dallas</text><text start="741.12" dur="3.44">i&apos;d be curious sort of how you would</text><text start="742.24" dur="4.64">pull that thread all the way from uh</text><text start="744.56" dur="4.079">holy andre young and i went in on</text><text start="746.88" dur="2.8">this to founding coordinate and making</text><text start="748.639" dur="3.121">it one of the most successful</text><text start="749.68" dur="3.599">coordination tools can you just kind of</text><text start="751.76" dur="2.8">take us through that yeah that linear</text><text start="753.279" dur="3.601">progression</text><text start="754.56" dur="3.92">for sure so yeah i was writing a science</text><text start="756.88" dur="3.28">fiction novel here in the middle of</text><text start="758.48" dur="4.799">nowhere and um</text><text start="760.16" dur="4.56">a friend sent me a text by wifey wifi</text><text start="763.279" dur="3.36">and i was like let me take a look at</text><text start="764.72" dur="3.76">this and i found</text><text start="766.639" dur="4.0">this was like in the last day of the</text><text start="768.48" dur="3.599">wifey farming and i found the whole</text><text start="770.639" dur="4.161">story that so many of us know you know</text><text start="772.079" dur="5.76">andre cronier this uh idiosyncratic you</text><text start="774.8" dur="5.2">know principled crazy dev like gave away</text><text start="777.839" dur="4.081">his entire multi-million dollar project</text><text start="780.0" dur="3.44">to the community through minting wifey</text><text start="781.92" dur="4.24">token and gave it away in the first fair</text><text start="783.44" dur="4.88">launch and what that did to me i was</text><text start="786.16" dur="4.4">that was like this kind of singularity</text><text start="788.32" dur="4.8">moment it was this big bang of like</text><text start="790.56" dur="4.079">generosity and you know inspiration that</text><text start="793.12" dur="3.279">kind of echoed out through the through</text><text start="794.639" dur="4.241">the astral plane and it called people</text><text start="796.399" dur="4.641">like me in and many others that were</text><text start="798.88" dur="3.68">like wow i see this cool thing i want to</text><text start="801.04" dur="3.28">do this i want to be a part of this i</text><text start="802.56" dur="3.6">want to be somebody</text><text start="804.32" dur="3.36">that has principles before money you</text><text start="806.16" dur="4.16">know and is trying to create something</text><text start="807.68" dur="4.08">new and open up the financial system for</text><text start="810.32" dur="3.199">equal access and all this stuff it&apos;s</text><text start="811.76" dur="4.8">very much kind of</text><text start="813.519" dur="4.56">very high minded endeavor and um</text><text start="816.56" dur="3.12">so i just wanted to be part of that and</text><text start="818.079" dur="4.481">i i came in and there was no</text><text start="819.68" dur="5.839">organization it was a pure it was like</text><text start="822.56" dur="4.88">the most chaotic thing ever</text><text start="825.519" dur="4.081">just like the kind of dark ages dark</text><text start="827.44" dur="4.88">period after the inflaton field expanded</text><text start="829.6" dur="3.679">the you know the known universe and um i</text><text start="832.32" dur="3.199">was gonna say</text><text start="833.279" dur="3.92">primary primordial soup is the analogy</text><text start="835.519" dur="3.041">that comes to mind for me yeah that&apos;s</text><text start="837.199" dur="3.76">what it was it was all these people</text><text start="838.56" dur="4.399">bumping around all these you know just</text><text start="840.959" dur="3.521">molecules and ions you know bumping into</text><text start="842.959" dur="3.12">each other and some kind of superheated</text><text start="844.48" dur="2.96">gas and and</text><text start="846.079" dur="2.481">all this money flowing in which is</text><text start="847.44" dur="2.32">really important because there&apos;s been a</text><text start="848.56" dur="2.639">lot of cases like this throughout</text><text start="849.76" dur="2.8">history where like collective workers</text><text start="851.199" dur="3.041">collectives things like this doing a lot</text><text start="852.56" dur="3.68">of the same stuff but they didn&apos;t have</text><text start="854.24" dur="3.44">the same foundation of value capture</text><text start="856.24" dur="4.32">right and with that money that&apos;s like</text><text start="857.68" dur="4.24">real blood flow it allows for a</text><text start="860.56" dur="3.36">totally different level of activity and</text><text start="861.92" dur="4.56">energy and so</text><text start="863.92" dur="4.24">so i saw that and i was captivated and i</text><text start="866.48" dur="3.52">just had to be part of it and we worked</text><text start="868.16" dur="4.08">together in this decentralized way to</text><text start="870.0" dur="4.16">create the structure that you know</text><text start="872.24" dur="3.039">created the real dow that urine is and</text><text start="874.16" dur="2.4">you know urine has taken its own</text><text start="875.279" dur="2.881">direction there&apos;s a lot of ways you can</text><text start="876.56" dur="2.959">think about daos</text><text start="878.16" dur="2.72">one important difference i&apos;ll say a lot</text><text start="879.519" dur="2.961">of times people criticize urine for</text><text start="880.88" dur="2.88">having a multi-sig not being fully</text><text start="882.48" dur="2.24">unchained</text><text start="883.76" dur="2.72">that</text><text start="884.72" dur="3.76">there is a difference in its governance</text><text start="886.48" dur="4.24">i mean there is a difference between</text><text start="888.48" dur="5.12">governing an immutable smart contract</text><text start="890.72" dur="4.96">with you know five function calls um and</text><text start="893.6" dur="4.08">governing a incredibly chaotic group of</text><text start="895.68" dur="4.0">200 contributors that can do anything</text><text start="897.68" dur="4.24">right yeah those really require</text><text start="899.68" dur="5.44">different governance architectures so</text><text start="901.92" dur="5.279">we&apos;ve designed the latter</text><text start="905.12" dur="4.0">and um that brings me to coordinate</text><text start="907.199" dur="3.44">which um you know so we had to figure</text><text start="909.12" dur="2.719">out we weren&apos;t larping you know we</text><text start="910.639" dur="3.2">weren&apos;t trying to create governance</text><text start="911.839" dur="4.881">because it&apos;s some cool idea it&apos;s like we</text><text start="913.839" dur="5.201">had a persistent problem of all these</text><text start="916.72" dur="4.0">people trying to do something well and</text><text start="919.04" dur="4.32">also money coming in right as soon as</text><text start="920.72" dur="4.72">there&apos;s money coming in and it&apos;s a hefty</text><text start="923.36" dur="4.96">flow then people fight about it there&apos;s</text><text start="925.44" dur="5.519">rivalries there&apos;s coalitions and you&apos;ve</text><text start="928.32" dur="3.6">got real tangible governance to solve</text><text start="930.959" dur="3.201">there</text><text start="931.92" dur="3.12">yeah exactly so it&apos;s been tension driven</text><text start="934.16" dur="2.96">you know</text><text start="935.04" dur="4.4">practical operational needs from the</text><text start="937.12" dur="4.079">beginning and which is a blessing like</text><text start="939.44" dur="3.68">that is what you want to design the</text><text start="941.199" dur="3.44">system and that&apos;s kind of that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="943.12" dur="2.959">great so</text><text start="944.639" dur="3.041">so we designed a whole new system of</text><text start="946.079" dur="3.361">architecture of governance there through</text><text start="947.68" dur="3.44">multiple phases the most of all version</text><text start="949.44" dur="3.399">of it we call constrained delegation or</text><text start="951.12" dur="4.48">governance 2 which i designed with gabe</text><text start="952.839" dur="4.68">shapiro and um it&apos;s a kind of delegated</text><text start="955.6" dur="3.44">governance where instead of delegating</text><text start="957.519" dur="3.76">your voting power</text><text start="959.04" dur="4.96">you vote to delegate decision-making</text><text start="961.279" dur="4.321">power to autonomous teams that can act</text><text start="964.0" dur="3.279">on behalf of the dao</text><text start="965.6" dur="3.12">cool and that&apos;s yeah there&apos;s a lot more</text><text start="967.279" dur="3.041">to do there but</text><text start="968.72" dur="2.96">you know going to coordinate one of the</text><text start="970.32" dur="3.28">and feel free to ask any questions about</text><text start="971.68" dur="3.279">that but coordinate one of the one of</text><text start="973.6" dur="3.679">the real persistent challenges in</text><text start="974.959" dur="4.481">decentralized work is how do you handle</text><text start="977.279" dur="4.0">compensation and right</text><text start="979.44" dur="3.519">you know most of the time</text><text start="981.279" dur="4.56">you know you&apos;ve got grant mechanisms</text><text start="982.959" dur="4.401">you&apos;ve got uh old ideas like salary</text><text start="985.839" dur="2.721">investing equity but we need something</text><text start="987.36" dur="3.599">new we need something that&apos;s like dow</text><text start="988.56" dur="5.839">native and this is the fascinating</text><text start="990.959" dur="6.481">or you know whatever native we are</text><text start="994.399" dur="3.921">and so how do you actually create like</text><text start="997.44" dur="1.839">just</text><text start="998.32" dur="2.56">fair</text><text start="999.279" dur="4.24">asymmetric</text><text start="1000.88" dur="4.959">value allocation between groups of uh</text><text start="1003.519" dur="4.161">decentralized workers without a top-down</text><text start="1005.839" dur="3.041">you know right process and that&apos;s right</text><text start="1007.68" dur="3.2">so i guess</text><text start="1008.88" dur="4.399">i get why it has to be just and fair but</text><text start="1010.88" dur="3.759">why does it have to be a asymmetric</text><text start="1013.279" dur="3.041">what does that mean</text><text start="1014.639" dur="3.681">because the reality of the market some</text><text start="1016.32" dur="4.16">skill sets are more valuable than others</text><text start="1018.32" dur="3.759">oh i see okay right you could say you</text><text start="1020.48" dur="4.079">could say everybody shares equally and</text><text start="1022.079" dur="3.201">we all get you know 50 yeah a year you</text><text start="1024.559" dur="1.52">know</text><text start="1025.28" dur="1.519">um</text><text start="1026.079" dur="2.96">so</text><text start="1026.799" dur="3.201">proportionality basically to value</text><text start="1029.039" dur="2.561">creation</text><text start="1030.0" dur="3.439">well it has to be competitive with other</text><text start="1031.6" dur="4.8">systems right so like</text><text start="1033.439" dur="5.041">if another system of of compensation is</text><text start="1036.4" dur="3.84">going to have is is going to attract</text><text start="1038.48" dur="3.839">more people and if that&apos;s a top-down</text><text start="1040.24" dur="3.92">rigid hierarchical system but it rewards</text><text start="1042.319" dur="3.12">people better that&apos;s going to win</text><text start="1044.16" dur="3.919">in the near term</text><text start="1045.439" dur="3.841">um so we have to compete with that for</text><text start="1048.079" dur="3.361">talent yeah</text><text start="1049.28" dur="4.16">okay so um how does coordinate work and</text><text start="1051.44" dur="3.68">how did it solve that that sort of</text><text start="1053.44" dur="3.359">problem at urine</text><text start="1055.12" dur="3.36">yeah so in the early days at urine we</text><text start="1056.799" dur="4.0">had a small group of we call it</text><text start="1058.48" dur="3.84">recurring grants people that were you</text><text start="1060.799" dur="4.161">know pretty much full-time working on</text><text start="1062.32" dur="4.16">urine and so those compensation streams</text><text start="1064.96" dur="2.88">were settled but then there was a lot of</text><text start="1066.48" dur="4.24">other people that were contributing a</text><text start="1067.84" dur="4.32">lot in a part-time way and so we created</text><text start="1070.72" dur="3.44">this grants</text><text start="1072.16" dur="4.24">we had this well it was very emergent we</text><text start="1074.16" dur="3.28">just basically it started as gifts we</text><text start="1076.4" dur="2.96">just thought</text><text start="1077.44" dur="4.08">we&apos;ve got money we had this we had the</text><text start="1079.36" dur="4.16">operational power through a proposal to</text><text start="1081.52" dur="3.36">give away some money</text><text start="1083.52" dur="3.44">and so we were just like every month</text><text start="1084.88" dur="4.159">we&apos;d say hey who&apos;s been doing cool stuff</text><text start="1086.96" dur="5.28">and we say oh she has and he has and</text><text start="1089.039" dur="5.281">they have and we say 3 000 for her 2 000</text><text start="1092.24" dur="3.92">for him and we just give money away it</text><text start="1094.32" dur="3.04">was gifts it was not</text><text start="1096.16" dur="2.0">pro quo</text><text start="1097.36" dur="2.96">um</text><text start="1098.16" dur="4.08">and it was great it was really powerful</text><text start="1100.32" dur="3.92">but what we found pretty quickly after a</text><text start="1102.24" dur="3.6">few months is that</text><text start="1104.24" dur="2.799">it took a lot of work and like we didn&apos;t</text><text start="1105.84" dur="3.04">feel like we were particularly good at</text><text start="1107.039" dur="4.241">it you know we weren&apos;t seeing a lot of</text><text start="1108.88" dur="4.159">stuff and if you look at the</text><text start="1111.28" dur="3.279">theories of work and</text><text start="1113.039" dur="3.441">and people that have looked deeply at</text><text start="1114.559" dur="3.761">this generally the wisdom is at the</text><text start="1116.48" dur="3.6">edges of these types of networks like</text><text start="1118.32" dur="3.359">it&apos;s a lot harder to</text><text start="1120.08" dur="4.08">create a fair allocation from the center</text><text start="1121.679" dur="3.841">or the top or or the bottom but

allocation</text><text start="1280.0" dur="4.64">so i&apos;ve been really like kind of tickled</text><text start="1282.159" dur="5.841">by this idea of um inter-subjective</text><text start="1284.64" dur="6.08">consensus for measuring who&apos;s doing</text><text start="1288.0" dur="4.4">what work and and you know i&apos;m coming</text><text start="1290.72" dur="3.28">from this place of

dur="3.72">2018</text><text start="1298.72" dur="3.6">uh maybe 2019 people were trying to</text><text start="1300.72" dur="3.439">build these like</text><text start="1302.32" dur="3.359">page rank networked graphs where you</text><text start="1304.159" dur="2.88">could like look at people&apos;s commits and</text><text start="1305.679" dur="3.36">how many comments were on them and how</text><text start="1307.039" dur="3.201">many hearts they got um and you were</text><text start="1309.039" dur="3.201">trying to build this like objective</text><text start="1310.24" dur="3.6">measure of like which commits had value</text><text start="1312.24" dur="4.24">which is you know only inclusive of</text><text start="1313.84" dur="4.24">coders uh which is one problem but</text><text start="1316.48" dur="4.0">another problem is that when a measure</text><text start="1318.08" dur="3.92">becomes a measure it ceases to become a</text><text start="1320.48" dur="4.0">good measure i think i&apos;m butchering that</text><text start="1322.0" dur="3.84">quote but that&apos;s like the basic idea and</text><text start="1324.48" dur="3.76">and if you move from trying to like</text><text start="1325.84" dur="4.4">objectively measure these things and</text><text start="1328.24" dur="3.439">into an inter-subjective consensus of</text><text start="1330.24" dur="3.52">the participants that are deeply doing</text><text start="1331.679" dur="3.281">the work it becomes much harder to gain</text><text start="1333.76" dur="3.36">so you don&apos;t have that constraint of</text><text start="1334.96" dur="3.12">only code and then you also have this</text><text start="1337.12" dur="3.84">ability</text><text start="1338.08" dur="6.24">that um it&apos;s hard to game the perception</text><text start="1340.96" dur="5.12">of your peers of your work and so um i</text><text start="1344.32" dur="5.359">just think it&apos;s really intersubjective</text><text start="1346.08" dur="6.32">consensus is is a really elegant way of</text><text start="1349.679" dur="4.321">doing distributed resource allocation</text><text start="1352.4" dur="3.12">yeah i totally agree and it&apos;s it&apos;s good</text><text start="1354.0" dur="3.039">heart&apos;s law you know when a measure</text><text start="1355.52" dur="2.56">becomes a target it ceases to be a good</text><text start="1357.039" dur="1.841">measure and</text><text start="1358.08" dur="2.479">um</text><text start="1358.88" dur="3.36">all these basically any any metric you</text><text start="1360.559" dur="3.441">use an algorithmic system it will be</text><text start="1362.24" dur="3.919">gamed and then</text><text start="1364.0" dur="4.08">what you&apos;re creating is a is a</text><text start="1366.159" dur="3.441">environment of adversarial gaming where</text><text start="1368.08" dur="3.04">people are incentivized to take</text><text start="1369.6" dur="3.76">advantage of the system</text><text start="1371.12" dur="3.439">um and now adversarial</text><text start="1373.36" dur="3.04">techniques are</text><text start="1374.559" dur="3.201">important because there are adversaries</text><text start="1376.4" dur="2.399">out there right there are people that</text><text start="1377.76" dur="2.24">are going to act like that and you need</text><text start="1378.799" dur="2.961">to have</text><text start="1380.0" dur="5.039">something robust against that but what</text><text start="1381.76" dur="6.24">we found is in trusted uh creative</text><text start="1385.039" dur="4.961">groups that&apos;s the wrong</text><text start="1388.0" dur="4.08">mental model you know what you want to</text><text start="1390.0" dur="3.6">do is incentivize more trust and</text><text start="1392.08" dur="4.56">incentivize</text><text start="1393.6" dur="4.959">more safety and support and independence</text><text start="1396.64" dur="4.399">and sovereignty and so you that&apos;s</text><text start="1398.559" dur="4.561">coordinate comes from that perspective</text><text start="1401.039" dur="4.161">um which is what intersubjective</text><text start="1403.12" dur="3.52">consensus basically</text><text start="1405.2" dur="4.08">the belief that the people in the</text><text start="1406.64" dur="4.96">community are good and are</text><text start="1409.28" dur="4.399">you know not the naive belief but the uh</text><text start="1411.6" dur="4.079">the starting point that people are good</text><text start="1413.679" dur="3.841">and trustworthy right</text><text start="1415.679" dur="3.36">yeah yeah i think it&apos;s like really</text><text start="1417.52" dur="2.88">interesting that you sort of framed like</text><text start="1419.039" dur="2.481">there&apos;s adversarial environments where</text><text start="1420.4" dur="2.72">you need to</text><text start="1421.52" dur="2.88">take one approach and then there&apos;s</text><text start="1423.12" dur="3.039">environments where you&apos;ve got more of</text><text start="1424.4" dur="3.759">like kind of like a curated</text><text start="1426.159" dur="4.0">list of people that was seated with a</text><text start="1428.159" dur="4.241">trusted seed and then you can kind of do</text><text start="1430.159" dur="4.0">different things with those different</text><text start="1432.4" dur="2.639">trust environments</text><text start="1434.159" dur="2.64">maybe</text><text start="1435.039" dur="3.601">um and what i think is cool is how</text><text start="1436.799" dur="4.401">replicable the coordinate model has been</text><text start="1438.64" dur="4.88">you started in urine and now you all are</text><text start="1441.2" dur="3.76">when i talk to y&apos;all uh</text><text start="1443.52" dur="3.68">like maybe six or nine months ago it was</text><text start="1444.96" dur="3.12">like 45 different dials so you found</text><text start="1447.2" dur="2.88">that it&apos;s</text><text start="1448.08" dur="5.04">coordinate has has this model has</text><text start="1450.08" dur="4.64">replicated to many other dials and um</text><text start="1453.12" dur="3.36">congrats on your all of your success</text><text start="1454.72" dur="2.959">with that and i just think that uh you</text><text start="1456.48" dur="3.04">know i said at the start of the episode</text><text start="1457.679" dur="3.201">that you&apos;re this is amazing a priority</text><text start="1459.52" dur="2.88">thinker but you have all this empirical</text><text start="1460.88" dur="3.919">data and experience too and the</text><text start="1462.4" dur="3.84">intersection of that is is where really</text><text start="1464.799" dur="3.441">cool insights happen and thinking</text><text start="1466.24" dur="4.48">evolves because you can make a come up</text><text start="1468.24" dur="4.799">with a theory and and you can have the</text><text start="1470.72" dur="4.24">data to to validate whether or not it&apos;s</text><text start="1473.039" dur="4.161">a thing so um anything you want to say</text><text start="1474.96" dur="4.4">about the expansion from urine into all</text><text start="1477.2" dur="3.52">these other dials using coordinate</text><text start="1479.36" dur="3.919">well it&apos;s just been really exciting to</text><text start="1480.72" dur="4.24">see how many uh yeah i mean there was 45</text><text start="1483.279" dur="2.801">back then there&apos;s hundreds now i think i</text><text start="1484.96" dur="3.44">don&apos;t know how many of them are super</text><text start="1486.08" dur="4.16">active we don&apos;t have great data but um</text><text start="1488.4" dur="4.399">but yeah it&apos;s been a tremendous amount</text><text start="1490.24" dur="4.4">of pick up trend amount of growth and</text><text start="1492.799" dur="3.36">the coordinate team is really</text><text start="1494.64" dur="3.6">doing some amazing stuff a lot of</text><text start="1496.159" dur="4.561">partnerships a lot of</text><text start="1498.24" dur="4.08">new ideas new designs coming coming soon</text><text start="1500.72" dur="2.559">so that&apos;s pretty exciting</text><text start="1502.32" dur="2.64">cool</text><text start="1503.279" dur="3.361">yeah all right i feel like we&apos;ve done</text><text start="1504.96" dur="5.12">our duty and we&apos;ve we&apos;ve done the</text><text start="1506.64" dur="5.2">through the through fair of uh of your</text><text start="1510.08" dur="3.04">experience into the space and the wi-fi</text><text start="1511.84" dur="3.839">into coordinates so should we get back</text><text start="1513.12" dur="3.919">to the to the weird to the theories</text><text start="1515.679" dur="4.161">let&apos;s go weird</text><text start="1517.039" dur="5.921">so uh you have a really grand view of</text><text start="1519.84" dur="5.36">dowels and of data that&apos;s really based</text><text start="1522.96" dur="4.4">in a lot of empiricism but now i want to</text><text start="1525.2" dur="4.0">get it more into theory so what are the</text><text start="1527.36" dur="4.08">most interesting sort of theories that</text><text start="1529.2" dur="5.2">you&apos;ve been developing and knowledge</text><text start="1531.44" dur="4.64">threads that

dur="3.919">you know i i usually use the lens of</text><text start="1540.96" dur="3.92">kind of development to think about a lot</text><text start="1543.039" dur="4.0">of this stuff and that&apos;s and</text><text start="1544.88" dur="3.679">you can look at</text><text start="1547.039" dur="3.361">kind of echoes of different</text><text start="1548.559" dur="3.681">developmental paths across all

dur="3.619">[Music]</text><text start="1564.88" dur="3.52">similarities between them so like</text><text start="1567.039" dur="3.281">in the talk i gave a shelling point</text><text start="1568.4" dur="5.2">there is this diagram of these three</text><text start="1570.32" dur="4.4">pyramids and you can see that like</text><text start="1573.6" dur="2.64">basically</text><text start="1574.72"

dur="5.12">foundation of chemistry right and and</text><text start="1695.2" dur="5.28">dna and then blood and body and then the</text><text start="1697.44" dur="4.56">person on top so that kind of

dur="4.64">standing on the shoulders of giants</text><text start="1731.679" dur="5.281">there and just comparing and contrasting</text><text start="1734.72" dur="3.679">those those those

dur="4.481">well i think it it&apos;s kind of important</text><text start="1743.039" dur="3.601">for human beings to kind of step back</text><text start="1744.88" dur="4.0">and be like wow this is a

a</text><text start="1756.159" dur="5.201">cosmic process of development right</text><text start="1760.24" dur="2.799">and from different frames it&apos;s</text><text start="1761.36" dur="4.4">completely different and it helps i</text><text start="1763.039" dur="5.12">think it helps me to let go and let the</text><text start="1765.76" dur="3.84">emergent</text><text

dur="2.959">and</text><text start="1784.0" dur="4.48">and the sort of you know the the idea</text><text start="1786.159" dur="4.0">that you gave us at that talk which is</text><text start="1788.48" dur="3.919">the structure of an organization affects</text><text start="1790.159" dur="4.4">its abilities for its contributors to</text><text start="1792.399" dur="3.921">perceive and have autonomy

know</text><text start="1799.44" dur="3.119">i guess not all structures are are the</text><text start="1801.039" dur="3.441">same in their ability to sense make and</text><text start="1802.559" dur="4.24">to to compete in the world like do you</text><text start="1804.48" dur="4.88">have trach&apos;s magic formula for for for</text><text start="1806.799" dur="4.561">what works in the in the

i have some ideas of some pieces</text><text start="1814.799" dur="4.0">you know okay</text><text start="1816.159" dur="4.081">um and it kind of starts with um this</text><text start="1818.799" dur="3.441">kind of transition moment that we&apos;re in</text><text start="1820.24" dur="4.159">again right like the cordyceps has done</text><text start="1822.24" dur="4.159">its job we&apos;ve spread</text><text start="1824.399" dur="4.481">computation in humans all over the world</text><text start="1826.399" dur="4.801">and and money and now we need to shift</text><text start="1828.88"

of</text><text start="1863.36" dur="4.64">another kind of spiritual or tantric</text><text start="1866.0" dur="4.72">lens where command and control are both</text><text start="1868.0" dur="5.12">very

of</text><text start="1875.12" dur="4.64">it&apos;s more feminine um</text><text start="1877.519" dur="5.681">and in the notion of the divine feminine</text><text start="1879.76" dur="6.48">i

speak</text><text start="1888.559" dur="4.72">rather than then go and go and that&apos;s</text><text start="1891.519" dur="3.601">the notion you know charles eisenstein</text><text start="1893.279" dur="3.28">talks about this that we&apos;re the period</text><text start="1895.12" dur="2.96">of our life where we have where we&apos;re</text><text start="1896.559" dur="4.0">growing up we have to go

start="1908.32" dur="2.959">right all right sounds like you&apos;ve been</text><text start="1909.84" dur="3.76">green-pilled i don&apos;t even have to try to</text><text start="1911.279" dur="3.681">green teal you on this</text><text start="1913.6" dur="3.679">oh yeah</text><text start="1914.96" dur="4.64">so so how do like how do we do that like</text><text start="1917.279" dur="4.4">how how do we have the internet of money</text><text start="1919.6" dur="4.079">we&apos;ve got mother earth how how love</text><text start="1921.679" dur="3.921">earth like how do we how do we build a</text><text start="1923.679" dur="4.48">more regenerative crypto economic system</text><text start="1925.6" dur="5.28">how do we uh evolve into this next phase</text><text start="1928.159" dur="5.281">and um avoid it avoid the mistakes that</text><text start="1930.88" dur="4.799">that we might be headed towards</text><text start="1933.44" dur="5.52">yeah i mean it&apos;s all happening all at</text><text start="1935.679" dur="5.281">once right now and i think um it&apos;s like</text><text start="1938.96" dur="4.24">how does the caterpillar know to turn</text><text start="1940.96" dur="3.92">into a cellular slurry and like grow</text><text start="1943.2" dur="3.68">wings like</text><text start="1944.88" dur="4.159">from one level it&apos;s like far beyond any</text><text start="1946.88" dur="3.12">one of our ideas and i think from</text><text start="1949.039" dur="2.64">another</text><text start="1950.0" dur="3.36">level we can say</text><text start="1951.679" dur="3.84">it&apos;s fractal it&apos;s this idea of fractal</text><text start="1953.36" dur="4.799">sovereignty right so like if we want to</text><text start="1955.519" dur="4.88">create organ organizations</text><text start="1958.159" dur="4.481">that can live in balance with each other</text><text start="1960.399" dur="3.681">in the world we have to start by being</text><text start="1962.64" dur="3.2">able to live and balance with each other</text><text start="1964.08" dur="3.599">in the world so</text><text start="1965.84" dur="2.959">develop there&apos;s personal development and</text><text start="1967.679" dur="2.801">collective development that are</text><text start="1968.799" dur="2.72">happening in synchrony</text><text start="1970.48" dur="2.96">and</text><text start="1971.519" dur="3.921">importantly we have to build on solid</text><text start="1973.44" dur="3.68">ground just like the difference between</text><text start="1975.44" dur="6.239">building on blockchain versus building</text><text start="1977.12" dur="6.0">on a public like a bank&apos;s ledger book um</text><text start="1981.679" dur="3.441">one is more solid than the other and as</text><text start="1983.12" dur="4.88">a human being i have to i have to grow</text><text start="1985.12" dur="4.96">on solid foundations of you know</text><text start="1988.0" dur="4.48">clearing up the traumas from my</text><text start="1990.08" dur="4.56">childhood and you know learning how to</text><text start="1992.48" dur="3.84">relate to other people and doing the</text><text start="1994.64" dur="3.84">work to become a more</text><text start="1996.32" dur="4.0">vibrant and sovereign being</text><text start="1998.48" dur="4.079">not because of some woo-woo thing but</text><text start="2000.32" dur="5.04">because that makes me like a</text><text start="2002.559" dur="3.521">healthier part of this organism we&apos;re in</text><text start="2005.36" dur="2.799">and</text><text start="2006.08" dur="3.839">so there&apos;s that piece and then the</text><text start="2008.159" dur="5.36">organisms themselves the organizations</text><text start="2009.919" dur="5.281">they need to grow on solid foundations</text><text start="2013.519" dur="3.201">and this is like you know another idea</text><text start="2015.2" dur="3.199">that i just have been trying like it&apos;s</text><text start="2016.72" dur="3.36">been melting my brain from your talk is</text><text start="2018.399" dur="3.76">this idea of dallas having process</text><text start="2020.08" dur="3.599">fidelity which is basically like if i&apos;m</text><text start="2022.159" dur="3.441">a node in a network i have to trust that</text><text start="2023.679" dur="3.921">the network&apos;s gonna follow the process</text><text start="2025.6" dur="4.0">operational access which i think is</text><text start="2027.6" dur="4.64">access to the information</text><text start="2029.6" dur="4.4">uh that you need to do your job and to</text><text start="2032.24" dur="3.279">be involved in the network topology</text><text start="2034.0" dur="3.84">which is being able to navigate where in</text><text start="2035.519" dur="4.16">the network you are um but those that&apos;s</text><text start="2037.84" dur="3.36">my interpretation but like i think it&apos;s</text><text start="2039.679" dur="3.521">really interesting that you came up with</text><text start="2041.2" dur="3.76">like i&apos;m really bad at being concise and</text><text start="2043.2" dur="3.52">these are like six words for like how to</text><text start="2044.96" dur="4.24">design your doubt process fidelity</text><text start="2046.72" dur="4.8">operational access and network topology</text><text start="2049.2" dur="3.679">sorry topography um anything to say</text><text start="2051.52" dur="3.359">about that</text><text start="2052.879" dur="3.601">yeah that&apos;s a better answer to your</text><text start="2054.879" dur="3.841">question than the previous one i gave so</text><text start="2056.48" dur="4.159">let me speak about that that&apos;s thank you</text><text start="2058.72" dur="4.0">for that prompt um</text><text start="2060.639" dur="3.921">yeah so how do we make daos that are not</text><text start="2062.72" dur="3.439">going to just be a corporation on the</text><text start="2064.56" dur="2.559">blockchain how are we going to work</text><text start="2066.159" dur="3.68">together</text><text start="2067.119" dur="4.48">in a way that allows us to</text><text start="2069.839" dur="4.481">uh handle the wicked challenges in the</text><text start="2071.599" dur="4.08">world and you know and and live in</text><text start="2074.32" dur="3.839">balance with the

start="2080.96" dur="4.0">identified</text><text start="2082.639" dur="4.321">that help you see that you know to make</text><text start="2084.96" dur="3.36">more downness and less corporateness

dur="3.681">command and control and so process</text><text start="2091.52" dur="2.96">fidelity is like probably the most</text><text start="2093.28" dur="2.72">important one</text><text start="2094.48" dur="3.84">which is the um</text><text start="2096.0" dur="4.8">which is based on blockchain like how</text><text start="2098.32" dur="3.92">much can you trust this system and not</text><text start="2100.8" dur="3.039">just how much can i trust that my</text><text start="2102.24" dur="3.68">bitcoin is going to be there tomorrow</text><text start="2103.839" dur="4.24">but how much can i trust that this</text><text start="2105.92" dur="4.32">organization or this dow you know is</text><text start="2108.079" dur="3.841">going to reward me for my work or that</text><text start="2110.24" dur="4.24">if i put effort into this thing it&apos;s</text><text start="2111.92" dur="4.72">going to go in somewhere well or like</text><text start="2114.48" dur="3.119">that this per this anonymous dev online</text><text start="2116.64" dur="2.16">is like</text><text start="2117.599" dur="3.76">somebody good to work with like these</text><text start="2118.8" dur="3.44">are all big challenges like</text><text start="2121.359" dur="3.041">um</text><text start="2122.24" dur="3.839">but that&apos;s key the more that&apos;s the key a</text><text start="2124.4" dur="4.24">key foundational layer</text><text start="2126.079" dur="4.081">um which is very different than you know</text><text start="2128.64" dur="3.04">in comparison to corporate process</text><text start="2130.16" dur="3.36">fidelity if you look at like private</text><text start="2131.68" dur="3.439">corporations versus public corporations</text><text start="2133.52" dur="3.839">versus

dur="3.44">and then the next one operational access</text><text start="2140.4" dur="3.76">like you said it&apos;s like uh</text><text start="2142.16" dur="4.88">you know how accessible is it how</text><text start="2144.16" dur="5.52">legible is it how transparent is it for</text><text start="2147.04" dur="4.72">a new person starting can they um you</text><text start="2149.68" dur="5.76">know can a 13 year old from gambia come</text><text start="2151.76" dur="6.0">in who&apos;s a genius and can she uh you</text><text start="2155.44" dur="4.0">know be able to weigh in on a

start="2166.96" dur="3.119">that&apos;s hard to do</text><text start="2168.96" dur="2.96">and the last one is the network</text><text start="2170.079" dur="3.441">topography and you know i kind of think</text><text start="2171.92" dur="4.4">of these as like</text><text start="2173.52" dur="4.4">car driver and road like the process</text><text start="2176.32" dur="3.2">fidelity is your car how much can you</text><text start="2177.92" dur="3.84">trust the vehicle the operational access</text><text start="2179.52" dur="3.52">is the driver who&apos;s able to drive it and</text><text

start="2479.839" dur="5.361">it&apos;s like where that puts me is is like</text><text start="2483.04" dur="3.76">how do we get them to harm like harness</text><text start="2485.2" dur="4.24">their

dur="2.96">you know the nature metaphor comes back</text><text start="2497.68" dur="3.2">for me we&apos;re in this cambrian explosion</text><text start="2499.2" dur="3.84">of possibility there&apos;s many design</text><text start="2500.88" dur="3.92">opportunities you can get away right now</text><text start="2503.04" dur="3.799">with like low-hanging fruit stuff like</text><text start="2504.8" dur="4.799">simple strategies like</text><text start="2506.839" dur="5.081">um basically just like simple stuff but</text><text start="2509.599" dur="4.0">also adversarial stuff so like taking</text><text start="2511.92" dur="3.84">advantage of people like rug pulls are</text><text start="2513.599" dur="4.321">basically like viruses in this metaphor</text><text start="2515.76" dur="4.16">and like derivative</text><text start="2517.92" dur="3.679">fork vegetable coins are like cancer</text><text start="2519.92" dur="3.04">it&apos;s just like growth at all costs until</text><text start="2521.599" dur="3.361">like there&apos;s no more hosts to consume</text><text start="2522.96" dur="3.84">and then it dies so how do we speedrun</text><text start="2524.96" dur="3.76">the evolution of all this stuff to get</text><text start="2526.8" dur="5.2">to like the crypto equivalent of mammals</text><text start="2528.72" dur="5.359">or mycelial networks or like dolphins um</text><text start="2532.0" dur="3.44">and of course uh evolution is an omni</text><text start="2534.079" dur="3.121">omnidirectional so like we&apos;re not just</text><text start="2535.44" dur="4.879">going towards one</text><text start="2537.2" dur="4.56">one apex but um and also evolution</text><text start="2540.319" dur="3.28">doesn&apos;t stop like things will evolve</text><text start="2541.76" dur="3.28">past humans from here but you know how</text><text start="2543.599" dur="5.281">do we get to the advanced strategies</text><text start="2545.04" dur="5.52">that are symbiotic um and and fair and</text><text start="2548.88" dur="3.52">like create a world that we want to that</text><text start="2550.56" dur="3.759">we want to live in do you have any</text><text start="2552.4" dur="4.08">sort of sort of thoughts on that</text><text start="2554.319" dur="4.401">yeah it&apos;s a it&apos;s a big question it&apos;s</text><text start="2556.48" dur="3.44">like a lot of things come to mind and</text><text start="2558.72" dur="2.8">the first thing that comes to mind is</text><text start="2559.92" dur="4.48">that there&apos;s all different types of</text><text start="2561.52" dur="4.4">people on this planet right like</text><text start="2564.4" dur="3.199">there are people that think the best</text><text start="2565.92" dur="3.36">thing to do is go and kill somebody else</text><text start="2567.599" dur="3.441">there are people that want to give all</text><text start="2569.28" dur="3.44">of their stuff away to help</text><text start="2571.04" dur="3.2">others like there&apos;s everything and</text><text start="2572.72" dur="2.8">there&apos;s children too there&apos;s every</text><text start="2574.24" dur="3.119">different level of development all</text><text start="2575.52" dur="4.079">happening all at the same time and it&apos;s</text><text start="2577.359" dur="4.401">like if you want to have a good time at</text><text start="2579.599" dur="4.081">this party with your kid like you got to</text><text start="2581.76" dur="3.04">have some weird thing for the kid to</text><text start="2583.68" dur="3.04">play with too</text><text start="2584.8" dur="3.76">you know that&apos;s useful for them</text><text start="2586.72" dur="3.92">and so that you can do something also</text><text start="2588.56" dur="4.16">and so we need to design</text><text start="2590.64" dur="4.56">systems not from an ideological</text><text start="2592.72" dur="3.84">perspective of like this is the best way</text><text start="2595.2" dur="2.56">to do it everybody needs to do it but</text><text start="2596.56" dur="3.039">like</text><text start="2597.76" dur="3.599">kind of coming from the open perspective</text><text start="2599.599" dur="4.48">that everybody actually does have</text><text start="2601.359" dur="4.24">something useful to contribute um</text><text start="2604.079" dur="3.361">and actually there&apos;s a frame where you</text><text start="2605.599" dur="4.641">can think every action is actually</text><text start="2607.44" dur="4.159">valuable no matter how crazy it is um</text><text start="2610.24" dur="3.44">but because from that person&apos;s</text><text start="2611.599" dur="3.601">perspective we are all trying to</text><text start="2613.68" dur="3.36">actually do something good even if we</text><text start="2615.2" dur="3.2">think that even if we&apos;re so distorted</text><text start="2617.04" dur="2.4">that&apos;s killing somebody we still think</text><text

dur="3.6">um yeah</text><text start="2786.24" dur="4.72">or we can fall back to something a</text><text start="2788.48" dur="5.28">little a different way of thinking and</text><text start="2790.96" dur="3.92">just just instead of like for me one of</text><text start="2793.76" dur="2.72">the guiding</text><text start="2794.88" dur="2.8">principles that&apos;s helped me in my life</text><text start="2796.48" dur="2.96">is like when i&apos;m trying to think about</text><text start="2797.68" dur="3.84">what i want to do</text><text start="2799.44" dur="4.159">i just think about what my

dur="4.0">i think this is what</text><text start="2807.52" dur="3.76">we need to do endows and we need to do</text><text start="2809.52" dur="2.88">in this new in in regenerative</text><text

dur="2.72">this reminds me of a part of your talk</text><text start="2823.44" dur="3.679">where you have this really amazing venn</text><text start="2824.72" dur="3.92">diagram with four overlapping

start="2831.68" dur="4.159">and one of the beautiful things i think</text><text start="2832.96" dur="4.56">i see here is do what you love and what</text><text start="2835.839" dur="3.201">you&apos;re

the</text><text start="2846.48" dur="2.72">world and all of the things that we need</text><text start="2848.16" dur="1.84">to fix</text><text start="2849.2" dur="3.52">and</text><text start="2850.0" dur="5.2">often is at you know the psychology of</text><text start="2852.72" dur="4.48">of of humans is one that often projects</text><text start="2855.2" dur="3.2">and and we take our fear and we project</text><text start="2857.2" dur="3.119">it on the world we take our pain we</text><text start="2858.4" dur="3.76">project on others and then that makes it</text><text start="2860.319" dur="3.04">feel like it&apos;s easier to fix if i go and</text><text start="2862.16" dur="2.8">change this</text><text start="2863.359" dur="3.841">then i&apos;ll be okay</text><text start="2864.96" dur="3.76">and that little trick is actually kind</text><text start="2867.2" dur="4.48">of the root of all of our suffering</text><text start="2868.72" dur="5.76">that&apos;s moloch&apos;s work right there and</text><text start="2871.68" dur="5.439">um if we can reclaim that stuff and and</text><text start="2874.48" dur="4.8">and think about that diagram of ikeguy</text><text start="2877.119" dur="4.801">the dao guy right</text><text start="2879.28" dur="4.4">and and reclaim the power and see what</text><text start="2881.92" dur="3.679">what do i want to do how can i be of</text><text start="2883.68" dur="3.84">service now it&apos;s not on me it&apos;s not my</text><text start="2885.599" dur="4.321">responsibility over all these other</text><text start="2887.52" dur="3.76">people to fix them or fix everything</text><text start="2889.92" dur="3.439">first take responsibility for my own</text><text start="2891.28" dur="3.2">actions and my own needs</text><text start="2893.359" dur="2.48">and uh</text><text start="2894.48" dur="2.879">you don&apos;t even you know if we&apos;re all</text><text start="2895.839" dur="4.24">doing that it doesn&apos;t really even matter</text><text start="2897.359" dur="5.041">what technology we have</text><text start="2900.079" dur="3.681">so i think that that&apos;s the i blow that</text><text start="2902.4" dur="3.6">down in my head too and i just wrote it</text><text start="2903.76" dur="4.079">down the note how can i be of service</text><text start="2906.0" dur="4.64">now this is the question that dao</text><text start="2907.839" dur="3.841">contributors can can ask</text><text start="2910.64" dur="2.479">yeah</text><text start="2911.68" dur="3.28">amazing</text><text start="2913.119" dur="4.321">um and that requires so many things that</text><text start="2914.96" dur="5.52">requires sense and respond that requires</text><text start="2917.44" dur="4.48">sensing what the dial needs um and</text><text start="2920.48" dur="3.52">looking at yourself and what you love</text><text start="2921.92" dur="4.159">what you&apos;re best at it and asking that</text><text start="2924.0" dur="3.2">question of what can it be paid for</text><text start="2926.079" dur="3.361">and then</text><text start="2927.2" dur="3.6">you know does it sort of</text><text start="2929.44" dur="3.36">your talk title is called fractal</text><text start="2930.8" dur="3.44">sovereignty the emerging structure of</text><text start="2932.8" dur="3.519">decentralized work so does it just</text><text start="2934.24" dur="3.599">fractal from there you have fractal</text><text start="2936.319" dur="3.201">sovereignty and fractal coordination</text><text start="2937.839" dur="3.0">when you start thinking about how i can</text><text start="2939.52" dur="3.44">be of service</text><text start="2940.839" dur="3.72">servicenow i think so i mean it goes all</text><text start="2942.96" dur="4.399">the way down like there&apos;s this notion of</text><text start="2944.559" dur="4.401">cellular psychology that you know that</text><text start="2947.359" dur="2.881">we have this feeling of like oh i don&apos;t</text><text start="2948.96" dur="3.44">feel good something&apos;s wrong but actually</text><text start="2950.24" dur="3.76">that&apos;s like it&apos;s not even at the level</text><text start="2952.4" dur="2.88">of the human it&apos;s actually an emergent</text><text start="2954.0" dur="2.8">property of all these different cells</text><text start="2955.28" dur="3.68">having different feelings and then we&apos;re</text><text start="2956.8" dur="4.319">feeling their feelings and and then it</text><text start="2958.96" dur="4.08">goes up to the doubt too like if all the</text><text start="2961.119" dur="4.0">different contributors in the dao you</text><text start="2963.04" dur="3.92">know or one way this is the idea of</text><text start="2965.119" dur="3.681">fractal sovereignty like for the doubt</text><text start="2966.96" dur="4.0">to be most effective and most efficient</text><text start="2968.8" dur="4.08">mind all of its constituent parts need</text><text start="2970.96" dur="3.52">to also be that way</text><text start="2972.88" dur="3.28">and sovereignty is the lens i use to</text><text start="2974.48" dur="3.44">look at it and this word is actually</text><text start="2976.16" dur="3.76">kind of triggering in some ways because</text><text start="2977.92" dur="4.8">it can mean a king in which it has</text><text start="2979.92" dur="5.199">dominion but just like in all things</text><text start="2982.72" dur="4.08">there&apos;s developmental lenses so like</text><text start="2985.119" dur="3.921">as a child maybe sovereignty is having</text><text start="2986.8" dur="3.68">control of your limbs you know and then</text><text start="2989.04" dur="3.12">you can think of it as being like a king</text><text start="2990.48" dur="4.639">but then at a higher level it&apos;s really</text><text start="2992.16" dur="4.959">having responsibility for my own actions</text><text start="2995.119" dur="3.921">needs feelings you know an impact in the</text><text start="2997.119" dur="3.601">world without outsourcing that to other</text><text start="2999.04" dur="3.68">people or projecting it onto other</text><text start="3000.72" dur="4.879">people and endow full of that type of</text><text start="3002.72" dur="4.48">fractal sovereignty both healthy bodies</text><text start="3005.599" dur="2.801">you know and minds</text><text start="3007.2" dur="2.32">um</text><text start="3008.4" dur="2.439">yeah that&apos;s the thing i want to be a</text><text start="3009.52" dur="3.36">part</text><text start="3010.839" dur="3.961">of so what is the world in which</text><text start="3012.88" dur="2.8">coordinate is maximally successful look</text><text start="3014.8" dur="3.84">like</text><text start="3015.68" dur="4.72">coordinate or maybe your ideas which</text><text start="3018.64" dur="3.76">coordinate is a manifestation of just</text><text start="3020.4" dur="4.48">like the tip of the iceberg of</text><text start="3022.4" dur="4.24">oh man i mean it&apos;s it transcends all of</text><text start="3024.88" dur="3.199">the horrible history of labor in this</text><text start="3026.64" dur="2.24">world right like</text><text start="3028.079" dur="3.201">like</text><text start="3028.88" dur="4.8">in the beginning of the factory you know</text><text start="3031.28" dur="3.68">period of our of our lives like people</text><text start="3033.68" dur="2.8">were out in the fields and they didn&apos;t</text><text start="3034.96" dur="3.52">want to go to the factory work people</text><text start="3036.48" dur="3.76">they would be chained to the to the to</text><text start="3038.48" dur="3.52">the lines and they would go and put</text><text start="3040.24" dur="3.44">clocks in every town and train systems</text><text start="3042.0" dur="3.04">to force people to come and work but</text><text start="3043.68" dur="3.28">they wanted to do their own thing and</text><text start="3045.04" dur="3.6">they would break the clocks and</text><text start="3046.96" dur="4.0">but you know this logic of money has</text><text start="3048.64" dur="4.32">kind of pushed that forward and now we</text><text start="3050.96" dur="4.159">believe that work that we you have to</text><text start="3052.96" dur="4.159">have a work ethic you know and</text><text start="3055.119" dur="3.681">and that&apos;s good and you you need to go</text><text start="3057.119" dur="3.281">and do this thing that you don&apos;t want to</text><text start="3058.8" dur="2.88">do for the benefit of others this is all</text><text start="3060.4" dur="3.36">brainwashing</text><text start="3061.68" dur="2.879">um so the future of coordinate is one</text><text start="3063.76" dur="2.88">where</text><text start="3064.559" dur="4.081">that&apos;s all been broken down</text><text start="3066.64" dur="4.16">we don&apos;t have to have</text><text start="3068.64" dur="4.56">golden handcuffs you know to keep us</text><text start="3070.8" dur="4.319">interested in something we don&apos;t need to</text><text start="3073.2" dur="4.159">be peer pressured into work and have all</text><text start="3075.119" dur="5.281">these carrots and sticks in our lives</text><text start="3077.359" dur="5.361">but instead we can sense into what our</text><text start="3080.4" dur="4.719">calling is in the world what our gifts</text><text start="3082.72" dur="3.599">are and we can offer those to the</text><text start="3085.119" dur="2.881">community</text><text start="3086.319" dur="3.841">and then we can get rewarded by our</text><text start="3088.0" dur="4.16">peers and if i want to go take a month</text><text start="3090.16" dur="3.52">in patagonia you know i just need to</text><text start="3092.16" dur="2.8">talk to the people i&apos;m doing things with</text><text start="3093.68" dur="3.679">and i can go and i don&apos;t have to worry</text><text start="3094.96" dur="4.32">about the money like whatever salary</text><text start="3097.359" dur="4.72">structures or compensation structures</text><text start="3099.28" dur="4.319">will just slowly wither like synapses</text><text start="3102.079" dur="4.24">losing activation in the brain and they</text><text start="3103.599" dur="2.72">can regrow</text><text start="3106.4" dur="4.159">so i imagine this kind of nomad worker</text><text start="3109.2" dur="4.0">where you don&apos;t have to have any</text><text start="3110.559" dur="4.161">contracts with anybody you can work as</text><text start="3113.2" dur="3.44">much or as little as you want and when</text><text start="3114.72" dur="3.52">you put work out into this system and</text><text start="3116.64" dur="3.84">you need the technology and the</text><text start="3118.24" dur="3.76">substrates that can hold and present</text><text start="3120.48" dur="3.44">that work in a way that is legible and</text><text start="3122.0" dur="4.079">useful for others then you can get</text><text start="3123.92" dur="4.24">rewarded through overlapping gift</text><text start="3126.079" dur="5.361">circles from different communities by</text><text start="3128.16" dur="4.8">your peers and admirers and colleagues</text><text start="3131.44" dur="2.96">and um</text><text start="3132.96" dur="3.68">and and then do the same so you can work</text><text start="3134.4" dur="4.159">for five dollars at once one dow like</text><text start="3136.64" dur="4.4">you can stop you can do as much as you</text><text start="3138.559" dur="3.921">want or as little as you want</text><text start="3141.04" dur="3.36">right one of the things that i think is</text><text start="3142.48" dur="4.24">really challenging is as we move from</text><text start="3144.4" dur="4.4">this industrial age to the information</text><text start="3146.72" dur="3.28">age a lot of times it feels like we know</text><text start="3148.8" dur="3.68">what we&apos;re leaving we know the</text><text start="3150.0" dur="4.64">institutions that were we&apos;ve inherited</text><text start="3152.48" dur="3.44">from the baby boomers are not working</text><text start="3154.64" dur="2.4">and the industrial age is not working</text><text start="3155.92" dur="3.12">but we don&apos;t know what&apos;s next like we</text><text start="3157.04" dur="4.4">haven&apos;t grabbed that next monkey bar and</text><text start="3159.04" dur="4.24">but we&apos;ve let go kind of of the last one</text><text start="3161.44" dur="4.08">and and one of the things i think is</text><text start="3163.28" dur="3.68">really cool is that a lot of our motives</text><text start="3165.52" dur="3.28">around work like</text><text start="3166.96" dur="3.84">companies are around the 40-hour</text><text start="3168.8" dur="3.68">workweek which is something we inherited</text><text start="3170.8" dur="4.24">from the industrial age in factories and</text><text start="3172.48" dur="5.04">cubicles are inherited from the</text><text start="3175.04" dur="4.079">industrial age and and and it just feels</text><text start="3177.52" dur="3.44">like we&apos;ve kind of</text><text start="3179.119" dur="4.881">like i think that you just kind of</text><text start="3180.96" dur="4.72">articulated the next monkey bar from the</text><text start="3184.0" dur="3.76">40-hour work week which has just been</text><text start="3185.68" dur="5.2">prolific and and is really a relic of</text><text start="3187.76" dur="4.88">the industrial age so um you know</text><text start="3190.88" dur="3.76">continuing this metaphor of the next</text><text start="3192.64" dur="4.479">monkey bar you know what does work look</text><text start="3194.64" dur="5.439">like in in in this new world is there</text><text start="3197.119" dur="4.321">anything more to say about uh about how</text><text start="3200.079" dur="3.681">people join dallas and join these</text><text start="3201.44" dur="3.76">network sense and respond systems like</text><text start="3203.76" dur="3.2">if if i&apos;m out there and i want to get</text><text start="3205.2" dur="3.2">into what i wanted to get in dallas and</text><text start="3206.96" dur="4.48">i started want to start working this</text><text start="3208.4" dur="5.679">this way where where do i start</text><text start="3211.44" dur="5.119">yeah well to go backwards like yeah the</text><text start="3214.079" dur="4.48">place to start is to</text><text start="3216.559" dur="3.921">whatever communications environment</text><text start="3218.559" dur="4.081">you&apos;re in if it&apos;s twitter or</text><text start="3220.48" dur="4.48">some other group and seeing what&apos;s</text><text
