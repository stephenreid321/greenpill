start="504.0" dur="3.759">problem is they were always put in the</text><text start="504.96" dur="4.56">corner of schoolyard and usually a</text><text start="507.759" dur="4.241">teacher would retire

start="645.519" dur="5.041">came along right when we needed it</text><text start="648.0" dur="5.12">and web 3 is this way to build community</text><text start="650.56" dur="4.16">without a physical

dur="4.56">these the the food the challenge of food</text><text start="675.76" dur="4.4">just in their communities</text><text start="677.68" dur="4.48">and web 3 enables us to build this</text><text

start="685.6" dur="5.2">our community wants physical connection</text><text start="688.48" dur="3.52">so we now meet once a quarter</text><text start="690.8" dur="2.64">in person</text><text

really really</text><text start="712.399" dur="5.601">incredible we we are now a</text><text start="714.8" dur="5.2">19 person dow and in atlanta we probably</text><text start="718.0" dur="3.6">had 30 people show up even</text><text start="720.0" dur="3.519">even people who didn&apos;t have voting</text><text start="721.6" dur="3.76">rights yet or were not</text><text start="723.519" dur="3.601">able to participate because we&apos;re still</text><text start="725.36" dur="3.279">kind of growing slowly</text><text start="727.12" dur="3.279">they&apos;re like that&apos;s fine we just want to</text><text start="728.639" dur="2.88">be there and</text><text start="730.399" dur="3.041">it</text><text start="731.519" dur="3.201">enabled us what what what we did we had</text><text start="733.44" dur="2.88">a lot of financial support from our</text><text start="734.72" dur="3.359">donors</text><text start="736.32" dur="3.6">and we needed to figure out how to how</text><text start="738.079" dur="4.801">to provide that financial support</text><text start="739.92" dur="4.56">without physically being in a location</text><text start="742.88" dur="2.639">so for example we want to help someone</text><text start="744.48" dur="4.08">in</text><text start="745.519" dur="4.961">in detroit in a suburb of detroit</text><text start="748.56" dur="3.92">in our previous world in a pre-covered</text><text start="750.48" dur="3.52">world we would we would either fly to</text><text start="752.48" dur="2.72">detroit or we&apos;d have someone there</text><text start="754.0" dur="3.12">locally and</text><text start="755.2" dur="3.68">in fact we had an office there and we&apos;d</text><text start="757.12" dur="3.44">get to know those people we would</text><text start="758.88" dur="3.759">determine how good they are and whether</text><text start="760.56" dur="4.64">or not we can help them financially</text><text start="762.639" dur="5.681">in a web 3 world you decentralize that</text><text start="765.2" dur="5.6">you give voting rights to people who</text><text start="768.32" dur="4.48">who can pick the non-profits to support</text><text start="770.8" dur="3.76">in detroit for example</text><text start="772.8" dur="3.68">and then you also decentralize</text><text start="774.56" dur="3.839">accountability so in a year from now</text><text start="776.48" dur="3.52">when that nonprofit wants to ask for</text><text start="778.399" dur="3.521">more money</text><text start="780.0" dur="3.92">okay well what&apos;s the community say about</text><text start="781.92" dur="5.12">how are they doing and all of that done</text><text start="783.92" dur="5.2">all of that is done through discord and</text><text start="787.04" dur="3.919">what&apos;s beautiful about it is</text><text start="789.12" dur="4.8">the the web 3</text><text start="790.959" dur="5.361">the dow the actual dow part is so it&apos;s</text><text start="793.92" dur="3.84">all transparent so we know exactly where</text><text start="796.32" dur="3.36">the dollars go</text><text start="797.76" dur="3.519">we know exactly how voting rights work</text><text start="799.68" dur="2.88">like they might not be perfect we might</text><text start="801.279" dur="2.961">have to change them but at least you</text><text start="802.56" dur="5.279">know how they work</text><text start="804.24" dur="6.0">um you you you have a trustless system</text><text start="807.839" dur="3.521">that enables you to build amazing levels</text><text start="810.24" dur="2.88">of trust</text><text start="811.36" dur="4.08">because you if you were to ever leave</text><text start="813.12" dur="4.88">the dao you you understand how you would</text><text start="815.44" dur="4.32">be removed or you might choose to leave</text><text start="818.0" dur="2.48">but people there&apos;s no one person who</text><text start="819.76" dur="2.16">could</text><text start="820.48" dur="2.32">violate your rights or take it away from</text><text start="821.92" dur="3.039">you</text><text start="822.8" dur="3.839">uh it&apos;s been profound and so as a result</text><text start="824.959" dur="3.201">we&apos;ve now given away</text><text start="826.639" dur="3.121">uh</text><text start="828.16" dur="3.119">almost a million dollars up until the</text><text start="829.76" dur="4.96">end of march and now we&apos;re about to give</text><text start="831.279" dur="5.68">away up to another 860 000</text><text start="834.72" dur="3.44">uh we have 46 applications for this</text><text start="836.959" dur="3.361">quarter</text><text start="838.16" dur="3.28">just so just so people know how the dial</text><text start="840.32" dur="2.8">works</text><text start="841.44" dur="3.44">many dowels are done very differently to</text><text start="843.12" dur="3.92">us so what we did was we started with</text><text start="844.88" dur="3.68">this concept of progressively</text><text start="847.04" dur="2.64">decentralizing</text><text start="848.56" dur="3.44">and</text><text start="849.68" dur="4.719">it&apos;s a concept that matthew markman came</text><text start="852.0" dur="3.519">up with he&apos;s a architect of our dao</text><text start="854.399" dur="3.521">amazing</text><text start="855.519" dur="4.081">amazing human uh and you can you can</text><text start="857.92" dur="4.719">find him on twitter</text><text start="859.6" dur="4.72">uh he he he just has this academic view</text><text start="862.639" dur="3.841">on things rather than a</text><text start="864.32" dur="4.319">uh what i did see a lot in which was</text><text start="866.48" dur="4.32">really too speculation focused and</text><text start="868.639" dur="3.041">that&apos;s not i don&apos;t want to judge it but</text><text start="870.8" dur="2.0">uh</text><text start="871.68" dur="2.48">that wasn&apos;t what we&apos;re doing we&apos;re</text><text start="872.8" dur="3.36">philanthropy so</text><text start="874.16" dur="3.2">he really helped me create something</text><text start="876.16" dur="2.799">that was</text><text start="877.36" dur="3.919">uh how do we do the how do we how do we</text><text start="878.959" dur="3.521">do good things so we started with six</text><text start="881.279" dur="3.12">non-profits</text><text start="882.48" dur="3.68">rockstar non-profits that that big green</text><text start="884.399" dur="3.841">knew really well</text><text start="886.16" dur="4.08">and one of them is big green and five</text><text start="888.24" dur="2.959">five um uh</text><text start="890.24" dur="2.0">others</text><text start="891.199" dur="2.88">uh</text><text start="892.24" dur="4.08">three african americans</text><text start="894.079" dur="3.281">one native american uh from the kochiti</text><text start="896.32" dur="2.079">tribe</text><text start="897.36" dur="2.56">and</text><text start="898.399" dur="2.721">one hispanic</text><text start="899.92" dur="3.599">amazing woman</text><text start="901.12" dur="4.48">and then one person from big green</text><text start="903.519" dur="4.081">and they voted to bring on 10 new</text><text start="905.6" dur="4.16">non-profits last quarter</text><text start="907.6" dur="3.919">and now we added some donors including</text><text start="909.76" dur="2.639">myself i got a vote this time which is</text><text start="911.519" dur="2.56">really cool</text><text start="912.399" dur="4.161">which by the way is really cool like i</text><text start="914.079" dur="4.401">gave up my vote in the beginning</text><text start="916.56" dur="3.68">and then they gave me one back</text><text start="918.48" dur="4.08">and like i think that&apos;s really cool now</text><text start="920.24" dur="3.839">i feel obliged to vote of course which</text><text start="922.56" dur="4.639">is exciting but you&apos;re like oh my</text><text start="924.079" dur="4.641">goodness i i&apos;m a my decisions matter i</text><text start="927.199" dur="3.041">mean it&apos;s really cool and you guys at</text><text start="928.72" dur="3.679">gitcoin have been</text><text start="930.24" dur="3.76">an uh invaluable resource in teaching us</text><text start="932.399" dur="3.521">how to how to vote</text><text start="934.0" dur="2.72">effectively and assign dollars and so</text><text start="935.92" dur="2.88">forth</text><text start="936.72" dur="4.239">um but the uh</text><text start="938.8" dur="4.32">we&apos;re gonna potentially bring up to 46</text><text start="940.959" dur="4.161">non-profits the 46 have applied that</text><text start="943.12" dur="4.32">doesn&apos;t mean we would choose all 46 but</text><text start="945.12" dur="3.6">we have funding for all 46 it would just</text><text start="947.44" dur="2.72">be based on</text><text start="948.72" dur="2.72">how much money they get and who gets</text><text start="950.16" dur="2.64">more and less and</text><text start="951.44" dur="3.04">you&apos;ve really taught me this concept of</text><text start="952.8" dur="3.76">quadratic funding and and i&apos;ve heard</text><text start="954.48" dur="4.08">about quadratic voting and really is</text><text start="956.56" dur="4.32">wonderful to see it in action it&apos;s very</text><text start="958.56" dur="3.76">hard to explain in words and then when</text><text start="960.88" dur="3.28">you see it in action it&apos;s really fun</text><text start="962.32" dur="3.36">it&apos;s a fun</text><text start="964.16" dur="3.28">not a game i wouldn&apos;t call it again but</text><text start="965.68" dur="3.279">it&apos;s because we&apos;re we&apos;re taking your</text><text start="967.44" dur="2.88">advice we&apos;re not doing voting on one day</text><text start="968.959" dur="2.641">we know we&apos;re doing it over a week or</text><text start="970.32" dur="3.28">ten days</text><text start="971.6" dur="3.599">you get to vote</text><text start="973.6" dur="3.44">and and every additional vote you give</text><text start="975.199" dur="4.161">in on profit is worth a little bit less</text><text start="977.04" dur="4.64">and and you finish up and then you go to</text><text start="979.36" dur="3.839">the discord and you discuss a little</text><text start="981.68" dur="3.36">and then you go back to your voting and</text><text start="983.199" dur="3.76">you can change your vote because you&apos;ve</text><text start="985.04" dur="3.84">learned a bit more and then over the</text><text start="986.959" dur="4.161">week you kind of have this collaboration</text><text start="988.88" dur="4.0">that is created and that&apos;s come back to</text><text start="991.12" dur="4.32">community it comes back to this uh</text><text start="992.88" dur="5.519">amazing power that web 3 has</text><text start="995.44" dur="5.759">that is really different to the to the</text><text start="998.399" dur="4.88">the web 2 or even non-web world</text><text start="1001.199" dur="4.08">where everything kind of pushes you</text><text start="1003.279" dur="3.92">towards collaborating pushes you towards</text><text start="1005.279" dur="3.36">community pushes you towards building</text><text start="1007.199" dur="3.361">relationships and i think that&apos;s very</text><text start="1008.639" dur="3.841">cool yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s so beautiful and i</text><text start="1010.56" dur="3.36">can it&apos;s hard not to see the symmetry</text><text start="1012.48" dur="3.359">between what you said about learning</text><text start="1013.92" dur="4.08">about how community gathers through food</text><text start="1015.839" dur="3.68">and how community has gathered around</text><text start="1018.0" dur="3.6">big green dow can you tell us a little</text><text start="1019.519" dur="3.68">bit about the symmetries or what&apos;s</text><text start="1021.6" dur="3.12">different about the two the digital</text><text start="1023.199" dur="3.6">versus the physical communities you&apos;ve</text><text start="1024.72" dur="3.599">built you know that&apos;s a great question i</text><text start="1026.799" dur="3.441">don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s asked me that i</text><text start="1028.319" dur="3.281">think that in the case of food</text><text start="1030.24" dur="3.76">especially</text><text start="1031.6" dur="4.319">eating out at a restaurant where</text><text start="1034.0" dur="3.839">you you&apos;re you&apos;re</text><text start="1035.919" dur="3.681">uh you&apos;re maybe meeting someone for the</text><text start="1037.839" dur="3.84">first time or you&apos;re doing a business</text><text start="1039.6" dur="4.64">deal with someone and you kind of need</text><text start="1041.679" dur="3.76">neutral ground right and um when you go</text><text start="1044.24" dur="3.199">sit down at the restaurant you want to</text><text start="1045.439" dur="4.081">order a cocktail and you might</text><text start="1047.439" dur="3.201">uh just for like relax a barrier and</text><text start="1049.52" dur="3.68">then you kind of get to know someone a</text><text start="1050.64" dur="3.84">little bit more uh and then you by the</text><text start="1053.2" dur="2.479">end of that meal</text><text start="1054.48" dur="2.8">you know you&apos;ve been a couple of hours</text><text start="1055.679" dur="2.961">with someone whether it&apos;s a first date</text><text start="1057.28" dur="3.6">with someone or your anniversary with</text><text start="1058.64" dur="3.919">your husband or wife or whether it&apos;s a</text><text start="1060.88" dur="4.159">business relationship</text><text start="1062.559" dur="5.12">you know that person much much more and</text><text start="1065.039" dur="5.76">it it was enabled by eating in this</text><text start="1067.679" dur="4.801">restaurant that that is that is uh</text><text start="1070.799" dur="3.841">just one of the magical frankly the</text><text start="1072.48" dur="5.36">reason i&apos;m in it and when you when you</text><text start="1074.64" dur="4.96">apply it to big green dow what we see is</text><text start="1077.84" dur="3.68">something similar where people come</text><text start="1079.6" dur="3.12">together</text><text start="1081.52" dur="2.8">because</text><text start="1082.72" dur="3.36">there are some there&apos;s a selfish reason</text><text start="1084.32" dur="3.92">of course they want to get funded great</text><text start="1086.08" dur="4.32">or they might want to donate and have</text><text start="1088.24" dur="4.24">their philanthropy go to a food justice</text><text start="1090.4" dur="3.36">cause and i mean it&apos;s a very nice</text><text start="1092.48" dur="2.96">version of selfish but it&apos;s they&apos;re</text><text start="1093.76" dur="3.52">doing it for their own reasons</text><text start="1095.44" dur="3.28">and then when they&apos;re there</text><text start="1097.28" dur="2.96">the the same thing kind of happens as it</text><text start="1098.72" dur="3.04">happens in a restaurant you</text><text start="1100.24" dur="3.12">you might post something on discord you</text><text start="1101.76" dur="2.4">might do a quick vote here and there and</text><text start="1103.36" dur="1.76">then</text><text start="1104.16" dur="3.04">you get</text><text start="1105.12" dur="3.919">to get connected with someone else who</text><text start="1107.2" dur="3.52">might be voting similarly to you and you</text><text start="1109.039" dur="3.52">or you might want to ask them some</text><text start="1110.72" dur="3.12">questions why did

don&apos;t think there is a better platform</text><text start="1350.24" dur="4.319">and so if you think about big green down</text><text start="1352.48" dur="4.559">and the very nature of what we&apos;re doing</text><text start="1354.559" dur="3.281">if you try to do this centrally in other</text><text start="1357.039" dur="2.88">words</text><text start="1357.84" dur="3.839">we&apos;re

dur="4.64">people this quarter we&apos;d need</text><text start="1378.32" dur="5.52">a thousand people within a year from now</text><text start="1380.88" dur="5.44">and we have we have no hiring plan at</text><text start="1383.84" dur="4.88">all because this is all now done by the</text><text start="1386.32" dur="5.2">community so if we were to go from</text><text start="1388.72" dur="4.56">10

dur="4.32">there&apos;s no further overhead in fact the</text><text start="1396.96" dur="4.16">overhead maybe</text><text start="1398.72" dur="4.64">i mean relatively speaking in dollars</text><text start="1401.12" dur="3.76">maybe like you know negligible because</text><text start="1403.36" dur="3.439">you do a hundred million dollars through</text><text start="1404.88" dur="4.159">and it only

start="1761.919" dur="4.64">000 hours in into the governance of the</text><text start="1764.48" dur="4.079">big green dow and really encourage</text><text start="1766.559" dur="4.24">anyone who&apos;s

perfect for our application</text><text start="1780.08" dur="3.92">but it&apos;s going really well and so i</text><text start="1782.32" dur="3.12">would say some a lot lot you can learn</text><text start="1784.0" dur="3.36">from there</text><text start="1785.44" dur="3.839">and so i would say that i went through</text><text start="1787.36" dur="3.439">that that process of the doubt could

start="1822.32" dur="3.2">governments</text><text start="1823.52" dur="4.72">you probably need a representative in dc</text><text start="1825.52" dur="3.92">a lobbyist or or the united nations i</text><text start="1828.24" dur="2.64">just don&apos;t know maybe there&apos;s a way a</text><text start="1829.44" dur="3.76">doubt could help but i just don&apos;t know</text><text start="1830.88" dur="4.64">okay nothing comes to mind</text><text start="1833.2" dur="3.359">and then one of the one of these amazing</text><text start="1835.52" dur="3.2">uh</text><text start="1836.559" dur="3.441">non-profits working in deforestation you</text><text start="1838.72" dur="3.199">know climate change as it relates to</text><text start="1840.0" dur="4.159">deforestation came to me</text><text start="1841.919" dur="5.041">and i was like oh well that would be an</text><text start="1844.159" dur="4.88">obvious one where dao would be fantastic</text><text start="1846.96" dur="4.079">because deforestation happens on the</text><text start="1849.039" dur="4.561">edges of the amazon forest or it happens</text><text start="1851.039" dur="4.481">in northern canada or alaska or it</text><text start="1853.6" dur="5.36">happens in indonesia</text><text start="1855.52" dur="5.2">and you need you really benefit from</text><text start="1858.96" dur="4.719">decentralized

to be amazing</text><text start="1876.88" dur="3.2">for a dao</text><text start="1878.0" dur="5.2">and then what i&apos;ve also learned is this</text><text start="1880.08" dur="5.04">concept of

start="1886.559" dur="2.801">works is</text><text start="1887.6" dur="4.079">when someone in in detroit wants to</text><text start="1889.36" dur="3.919">apply again for another another

in the future um</text><text start="1948.88" dur="3.44">i guess another way of asking this is</text><text start="1950.799" dur="3.201">what does the world look like where</text><text start="1952.32"
