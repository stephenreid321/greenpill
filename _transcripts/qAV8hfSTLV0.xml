how</text><text start="225.36" dur="5.2">you came to author radical markets and</text><text start="228.239" dur="4.961">uh what your view is on regenerative</text><text start="230.56" dur="4.319">crypto economics how can we use crypto</text><text start="233.2" dur="4.48">and markets in order to create a better</text><text start="234.879" dur="4.161">world well a pretty funny thing is that</text><text start="237.68" dur="3.04">um</text><text start="239.04" dur="3.52">radical markets was written with eric</text><text start="240.72" dur="3.36">posner and i don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve ever</text><text start="242.56" dur="2.879">tried to read anything the eric posner</text><text start="244.08" dur="2.56">ever wrote about blockchain i didn&apos;t</text><text start="245.439" dur="2.241">really write about blockchain much</text><text start="246.64" dur="3.44">myself</text><text start="247.68" dur="5.04">but uh none of it was very positive you</text><text start="250.08" dur="4.48">know and eric posner and i actually our</text><text start="252.72" dur="5.759">original work was on financial</text><text start="254.56" dur="4.72">regulation in a direction that&apos;s pretty</text><text start="258.479" dur="2.801">uh</text><text start="259.28" dur="4.16">defy would find pretty</text><text start="261.28" dur="5.12">challenging to work with i think</text><text start="263.44" dur="5.44">um so eric and i were not crypto</text><text start="266.4" dur="5.12">enthusiasts we were really interested in</text><text start="268.88" dur="5.2">the potential of new types of social</text><text start="271.52" dur="4.88">mechanisms to be transformative</text><text start="274.08" dur="4.32">and when things started going really</text><text start="276.4" dur="4.88">weird in the world of politics around</text><text start="278.4" dur="5.519">2016 with brexit and donald trump and so</text><text start="281.28" dur="4.32">forth we felt an impetus to take some of</text><text start="283.919" dur="3.681">these ideas we&apos;d been developing pretty</text><text start="285.6" dur="4.24">academically and put them out there in a</text><text start="287.6" dur="4.319">form that different communities could</text><text start="289.84" dur="3.359">interact with and we didn&apos;t expect one</text><text start="291.919" dur="3.601">of those communities to be the</text><text start="293.199" dur="4.641">blockchain world but it turned out to be</text><text start="295.52" dur="4.239">um and</text><text start="297.84" dur="5.12">it was kind of in a weird</text><text start="299.759" dur="4.401">way vitalik had seen one of the papers</text><text start="302.96" dur="3.12">that went into the book and tweeted</text><text start="304.16" dur="5.12">about it and off of that tweet i got</text><text start="306.08" dur="5.28">more traffic than off of uh everything</text><text start="309.28" dur="4.32">that i&apos;d ever done on twitter before</text><text start="311.36" dur="3.76">and and so at that point i kind of</text><text start="313.6" dur="3.28">looked into him and he looked kind of me</text><text start="315.12" dur="5.12">like uh some kind of a bond villain you</text><text start="316.88" dur="6.08">know like a 23 year old billionaire you</text><text start="320.24" dur="5.44">know russian canadian like it was pretty</text><text start="322.96" dur="6.0">weird and so i i</text><text start="325.68" dur="4.48">dm&apos;d him and i said uh you want to take</text><text start="328.96" dur="3.36">a look at the book</text><text start="330.16" dur="3.599">and he sent me back 25 pages of the most</text><text start="332.32" dur="3.439">thoughtful comments i&apos;ve ever gotten on</text><text start="333.759" dur="3.361">anything and so i thought well maybe</text><text start="335.759" dur="4.401">there&apos;s something here</text><text start="337.12" dur="4.56">so i started corresponding with him and</text><text start="340.16" dur="4.319">working together and eventually wrote</text><text start="341.68" dur="4.48">this paper that i think played a role in</text><text start="344.479" dur="4.801">in starting your business</text><text start="346.16" dur="5.84">and uh yeah that&apos;s kind of the that&apos;s</text><text start="349.28" dur="2.72">kind of the right</text><text start="352.16" dur="3.36">we should clarify for the listeners out</text><text start="353.52" dur="3.36">there that vitalik is not a bond villain</text><text start="355.52" dur="3.36">actually one of the most pure-hearted</text><text start="356.88" dur="4.0">and lucid thinkers uh that i think i&apos;ve</text><text start="358.88" dur="4.159">ever met i couldn&apos;t agree more and in</text><text start="360.88" dur="3.36">the end i was i was surprised about it</text><text start="363.039" dur="3.041">yeah</text><text start="364.24" dur="3.6">uh well it so specifically i remember</text><text start="366.08" dur="3.52">reading radical markets and and and</text><text start="367.84" dur="4.479">learning about quadratic fund or sorry</text><text start="369.6" dur="4.48">quadratic voting and i think that the</text><text start="372.319" dur="4.081">outcome of your collaboration with</text><text start="374.08" dur="4.399">vitalik and also zoe hitzig was taking</text><text start="376.4" dur="4.239">quadratic voting and using it in a</text><text start="378.479" dur="4.081">monetary concept in quadratic funding</text><text start="380.639" dur="3.12">could you talk about that leap at all</text><text start="382.56" dur="3.6">yeah so</text><text start="383.759" dur="4.401">quadratic voting was originally</text><text start="386.16" dur="3.84">um actually originally quadratic voting</text><text start="388.16" dur="3.44">was supposed to be done with money</text><text start="390.0" dur="2.72">uh but then that was really unpalatable</text><text start="391.6" dur="2.879">to people</text><text start="392.72" dur="2.88">and so then and then we had a version of</text><text start="394.479" dur="2.72">quadratic voting where you got our</text><text start="395.6" dur="2.4">official currency</text><text start="397.199" dur="1.921">um</text><text start="398.0" dur="2.72">but then</text><text start="399.12" dur="3.199">we just took it in the direction of okay</text><text start="400.72" dur="3.919">what if you&apos;re funding a project rather</text><text start="402.319" dur="3.841">than making a decision</text><text start="404.639" dur="3.68">and</text><text start="406.16" dur="4.08">in that context because people are much</text><text start="408.319" dur="2.88">more used to like capitalism for funding</text><text start="410.24" dur="3.679">things</text><text start="411.199" dur="4.321">uh money seemed much more natural so we</text><text start="413.919" dur="3.441">used in that context it turns out</text><text start="415.52" dur="3.679">there&apos;s kind of a deep sense in which</text><text start="417.36" dur="4.16">quadratic voting and all these contexts</text><text start="419.199" dur="3.601">is actually kind of the same thing and</text><text start="421.52" dur="2.72">there&apos;s actually no difference really</text><text start="422.8" dur="3.119">between quadratic funding and quadratic</text><text start="424.24" dur="3.28">voting not sure it&apos;s worth going into</text><text start="425.919" dur="3.921">like the mathematical</text><text start="427.52" dur="3.92">uh logic behind that all here but you</text><text start="429.84" dur="3.04">can kind of just play with the formulas</text><text start="431.44" dur="2.96">and you&apos;ll and you&apos;ll see that they&apos;re</text><text start="432.88" dur="2.719">actually there&apos;s actually a sense in</text><text start="434.4" dur="3.6">which they&apos;re the same thing in</text><text start="435.599" dur="4.801">particular like if you had a quadratic</text><text start="438.0" dur="3.919">vote on should this project get this</text><text start="440.4" dur="3.6">amount of money</text><text start="441.919" dur="3.921">um if that was like the proposal and you</text><text start="444.0" dur="3.199">had a quadratic vote on it it turns out</text><text start="445.84" dur="3.759">you can just see from the formula that</text><text start="447.199" dur="4.56">it will pass exactly when</text><text start="449.599" dur="4.481">like it will pass exactly if that amount</text><text start="451.759" dur="4.241">of money is less than or equal to the</text><text start="454.08" dur="4.399">amount that it would get funded under qf</text><text start="456.0" dur="3.84">in in the equilibrium so it&apos;s like uh</text><text start="458.479" dur="3.601">they&apos;re actually the same thing in some</text><text start="459.84" dur="4.88">sense it&apos;s just like quadratic findings</text><text start="462.08" dur="4.32">like discovering the level of funding</text><text start="464.72" dur="2.56">that would pass a vote in a quadratic</text><text start="466.4" dur="2.32">vote</text><text start="467.28" dur="3.919">um</text><text start="468.72" dur="4.08">anyway but um</text><text start="471.199" dur="2.881">so the</text><text start="472.8" dur="3.36">uh</text><text start="474.08" dur="3.679">quadratic funding i think in some ways</text><text start="476.16" dur="3.599">has ended up being at least as impactful</text><text start="477.759" dur="3.921">if not more impactful than quadratic</text><text start="479.759" dur="3.041">voting because</text><text start="481.68" dur="2.88">the</text><text start="482.8" dur="4.64">sort of formulation</text><text start="484.56" dur="5.44">in the world of crypto is very much</text><text start="487.44" dur="3.92">around finance and money and whatever</text><text start="490.0" dur="3.039">rather that you know even though there</text><text start="491.36" dur="4.16">is decision making and governance issues</text><text start="493.039" dur="5.921">and whatever somehow like the sexy thing</text><text start="495.52" dur="4.799">is is funding there uh rather than you</text><text start="498.96" dur="3.2">know collective decision making and</text><text start="500.319" dur="5.121">governance even though as i pointed out</text><text start="502.16" dur="5.52">these are kind of the same thing um</text><text start="505.44" dur="3.28">but uh but that&apos;s the reason why i think</text><text start="507.68" dur="2.239">it&apos;s caught a lot of people&apos;s attention</text><text start="508.72" dur="2.8">in that world whereas in the world of</text><text start="509.919" dur="3.281">politics quadratic voting has gotten a</text><text start="511.52" dur="2.8">lot more attention</text><text start="513.2" dur="3.0">interesting</text><text start="514.32" dur="4.48">yeah i&apos;ll just say i&apos;m looking at</text><text start="516.2" dur="4.6">getcoin.comresults right now and so far</text><text start="518.8" dur="4.0">getcoin has funded 55 million dollars</text><text start="520.8" dur="3.76">worth of funding for open source</text><text start="522.8" dur="3.52">software and i think about two-thirds of</text><text start="524.56" dur="4.32">that has gone through the quadratic</text><text start="526.32" dur="5.12">funding mechanism so we owe a lot of our</text><text start="528.88" dur="4.0">traction at get coin to quadratic</text><text start="531.44" dur="3.12">funding and one of the things that i</text><text start="532.88" dur="3.84">think the users like</text><text start="534.56" dur="3.92">a lot is that they can fund a project</text><text start="536.72" dur="4.16">with a dollar and it can be matched with</text><text start="538.48" dur="4.08">tens sometimes hundreds of dollars so it</text><text start="540.88" dur="4.0">really gets people over that free rider</text><text start="542.56" dur="4.56">problem of why would i fund this when i</text><text start="544.88" dur="3.76">already get it for free uh well the</text><text start="547.12" dur="3.44">answer is because the matching pool is</text><text start="548.64" dur="4.319">going to contribute a lot especially to</text><text start="550.56" dur="4.24">the projects that get a lot of traction</text><text start="552.959" dur="4.081">from many many other people giving their</text><text start="554.8" dur="3.52">dollars it&apos;s kind of takes crowdfunding</text><text start="557.04" dur="4.4">and makes it into a multiplayer</text><text start="558.32" dur="5.68">compounding game absolutely</text><text start="561.44" dur="4.0">yeah so um where do you see uh i want to</text><text start="564.0" dur="3.68">talk about some other mechanisms that</text><text start="565.44" dur="3.76">are regenerative with you but uh i think</text><text start="567.68" dur="3.599">it&apos;d be really interesting to pinch and</text><text start="569.2" dur="4.319">zoom on quadratic funding itself where</text><text start="571.279" dur="3.68">do you see quadratic funding going in</text><text start="573.519" dur="2.241">the future</text><text start="574.959" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="575.76" dur="3.6">i think the most exciting applications</text><text start="577.839" dur="3.201">and you know we really emphasize these</text><text start="579.36" dur="2.4">in the original paper</text><text start="581.04" dur="3.6">are</text><text start="581.76" dur="4.639">to things like</text><text start="584.64" dur="3.28">media</text><text start="586.399" dur="3.44">i think media is one of the most</text><text start="587.92" dur="4.4">interesting areas this is one where</text><text start="589.839" dur="5.521">everybody knows that like capitalism is</text><text start="592.32" dur="6.16">completely broken like the number of</text><text start="595.36" dur="5.84">like the dwell time you can get on a cat</text><text start="598.48" dur="5.359">video versus on like an investigative</text><text start="601.2" dur="4.4">report that totally changes the world</text><text start="603.839" dur="4.0">just bears no relationship to what</text><text start="605.6" dur="4.0">anyone thinks the value of that</text><text start="607.839" dur="4.881">is you know</text><text start="609.6" dur="4.4">and at the same time nobody wants like</text><text start="612.72" dur="4.4">the government</text><text start="614.0" dur="5.279">giving out grants to be like the direct</text><text start="617.12" dur="3.68">uh you know source of funding for most</text><text start="619.279" dur="3.68">of the media so like both of those</text><text start="620.8" dur="3.68">models just don&apos;t work and on the other</text><text start="622.959" dur="3.44">hand like yeah philanthropists could</text><text start="624.48" dur="3.76">give out money but like who does someone</text><text start="626.399" dur="4.721">really want bill gates like determining</text><text start="628.24" dur="4.159">like what media gets funded so</text><text start="631.12" dur="3.04">so</text><text start="632.399" dur="5.0">clearly like the answer has to be</text><text start="634.16" dur="6.0">something in the spirit of</text><text start="637.399" dur="3.961">decentralized but public goods logic</text><text start="640.16" dur="3.28">based</text><text start="641.36" dur="4.24">funding and i just don&apos;t think there&apos;s</text><text start="643.44" dur="3.12">another systematic game in town at the</text><text start="645.6" dur="3.359">moment</text><text start="646.56" dur="4.24">and so i i think it&apos;s it&apos;s that&apos;s a</text><text start="648.959" dur="2.641">really natural application</text><text start="650.8" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="651.6" dur="4.96">campaign funding is like conceptually</text><text start="653.92" dur="4.56">very similar to media uh but it you know</text><text start="656.56" dur="3.2">it&apos;s a slightly different space and and</text><text start="658.48" dur="2.799">these types of mechanisms are already</text><text start="659.76" dur="4.72">used there so i think this is a</text><text start="661.279" dur="4.401">supernatural fit in that context</text><text start="664.48" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="665.68" dur="3.12">uh</text><text start="667.6" dur="2.32">but i i think there&apos;s all kinds of</text><text start="668.8" dur="3.12">things like one area that i think is</text><text start="669.92" dur="4.08">really exciting is within corporations</text><text start="671.92" dur="4.08">and in some sense like that&apos;s kind of</text><text start="674.0" dur="4.079">where bitcoin is because like yeah ethe</text><text start="676.0" dur="3.44">isn&apos;t a corporation but it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="678.079" dur="2.401">spiritually it&apos;s like some kind of a</text><text start="679.44" dur="3.519">private</text><text start="680.48" dur="3.919">loose decentralized entity and you guys</text><text start="682.959" dur="2.721">are sort of supporting things that make</text><text start="684.399" dur="2.88">that ecosystem work but you know i think</text><text start="685.68" dur="3.68">within microsoft</text><text start="687.279" dur="4.481">uh you know a big role that the office</text><text start="689.36" dur="5.68">of the cto that i work in plays</text><text start="691.76" dur="6.16">is to overcome sort of conflicts between</text><text start="695.04" dur="4.16">different organizations within microsoft</text><text start="697.92" dur="2.72">that</text><text start="699.2" dur="2.8">you know don&apos;t want to contribute to</text><text start="700.64" dur="2.879">underlying infrastructure that benefits</text><text start="702.0" dur="3.36">the whole company</text><text start="703.519" dur="3.041">they just want to do whatever benefits</text><text start="705.36" dur="3.68">the bottom line of their order that</text><text start="706.56" dur="4.56">they&apos;re getting credit for and</text><text start="709.04" dur="3.52">this provides a potential mechanism for</text><text start="711.12" dur="3.44">something like the office of the cto not</text><text start="712.56" dur="4.959">to have the big bureaucracy that we&apos;re</text><text start="714.56" dur="5.519">coming to have but instead to just have</text><text start="717.519" dur="3.44">some kind of a</text><text start="720.079" dur="2.481">you know</text><text start="720.959" dur="3.921">big pool of money</text><text start="722.56" dur="4.719">but a pool of money that&apos;s not directed</text><text start="724.88" dur="5.04">by executive fiat but by</text><text start="727.279" dur="4.8">um some decentralized process of sort of</text><text start="729.92" dur="4.0">virtual teams coming together saying</text><text start="732.079" dur="3.44">that we need to do this for the company</text><text start="733.92" dur="3.28">and then that just getting funding based</text><text start="735.519" dur="2.801">on willingness of their different orgs</text><text start="737.2" dur="2.72">to contribute to that common</text><text start="738.32" dur="3.68">infrastructure and have that matched by</text><text start="739.92" dur="3.12">a common pool</text><text start="742.0" dur="2.72">interesting</text><text start="743.04" dur="4.32">you know your story about quadratic</text><text start="744.72" dur="5.2">funding for media reminds me of git coin</text><text start="747.36" dur="4.4">grants has done 12 rounds thus far and</text><text start="749.92" dur="5.039">around round</text><text start="751.76" dur="4.8">three or four vitalik suggested that</text><text start="754.959" dur="3.68">you know this is before i should say</text><text start="756.56" dur="3.92">that right now bitcoin&apos;s quadratic</text><text start="758.639" dur="3.361">funding is governed by the dow and those</text><text start="760.48" dur="3.52">governance rights and all that kind of</text><text start="762.0" dur="4.32">stuff but around rounds three or four it</text><text start="764.0" dur="4.079">was really just bitcoin applying for a</text><text start="766.32" dur="3.759">grant from the ethereum foundation to</text><text start="768.079" dur="4.401">run the rounds and so um in the</text><text start="770.079" dur="4.32">negotiation process for</text><text start="772.48" dur="4.64">running round four i think it was</text><text start="774.399" dur="4.801">vitalik suggested that we do around for</text><text start="777.12" dur="3.68">media um which has always been foreign</text><text start="779.2" dur="4.0">for get coin because we&apos;re about funding</text><text start="780.8" dur="5.839">open source software and one of the</text><text start="783.2" dur="4.96">things that we saw was that the public</text><text start="786.639" dur="4.961">goods the open source software that were</text><text start="788.16" dur="5.76">being funded on git coin got a huge lift</text><text start="791.6" dur="4.16">from media projects also being on the</text><text start="793.92" dur="3.039">platform because the media projects were</text><text start="795.76" dur="3.519">the ones that were bringing large</text><text start="796.959" dur="4.161">twitter audiences and large mailing list</text><text start="799.279" dur="3.521">audiences and their visitors would come</text><text start="801.12" dur="3.279">to the site they would add their</text><text start="802.8" dur="3.68">favorite media organization to the site</text><text start="804.399" dur="3.601">but they would also add the digital</text><text start="806.48" dur="2.88">infrastructure the open source software</text><text start="808.0" dur="3.279">projects to their cart and check out</text><text start="809.36" dur="3.68">with all of them and so there was this</text><text start="811.279" dur="3.36">kind of like positive some game being</text><text start="813.04" dur="3.039">played between the media organizations</text><text start="814.639" dur="3.76">and the open source projects that&apos;s</text><text start="816.079" dur="5.601">interesting uh when when we added those</text><text start="818.399" dur="5.041">to the platform so i i wonder if there&apos;s</text><text start="821.68" dur="3.36">there&apos;s there&apos;s an option to fund</text><text start="823.44" dur="4.079">digital infrastructure technology</text><text start="825.04" dur="4.08">projects along with media and have the</text><text start="827.519" dur="3.841">sun be greater than the whole of its</text><text start="829.12" dur="3.68">parts uh do you have any sort of any</text><text start="831.36" dur="3.68">comment on that</text><text start="832.8" dur="4.96">sounds very interesting to me i mean one</text><text start="835.04" dur="6.159">thing that i pretty strongly believe in</text><text start="837.76" dur="7.12">is that the way that we actually get</text><text start="841.199" dur="6.0">a better internet is to get a much</text><text start="844.88" dur="3.6">larger set of people engaged with the</text><text start="847.199" dur="3.521">need for</text><text start="848.48" dur="3.44">digital public infrastructure i don&apos;t</text><text start="850.72" dur="3.359">think that like</text><text start="851.92" dur="4.88">random crypto people like doing their</text><text start="854.079" dur="5.281">little thing is gonna get us there i</text><text start="856.8" dur="3.76">don&apos;t think that like regulation is</text><text start="859.36" dur="3.12">gonna get us there i think what&apos;s gonna</text><text start="860.56" dur="4.16">get us there is like real public</text><text start="862.48" dur="3.76">engagement with constructively building</text><text start="864.72" dur="5.76">better solutions</text><text start="866.24" dur="5.839">and i think that the link between that</text><text start="870.48" dur="3.039">those things that generate the public</text><text start="872.079" dur="4.401">engagement</text><text start="873.519" dur="4.641">and the things that um</text><text start="876.48" dur="4.719">that are actually like that&apos;s exactly</text><text start="878.16" dur="6.0">what we want so so if that that that&apos;s a</text><text start="881.199" dur="3.921">example of a pathway to do it i&apos;m super</text><text start="884.16" dur="2.239">uh</text><text start="885.12" dur="2.64">super positive and you know that&apos;s the</text><text start="886.399" dur="3.68">way that radical exchange is designed</text><text start="887.76" dur="5.36">right radical exchange has this big art</text><text start="890.079" dur="5.281">base and it also has a big community of</text><text start="893.12" dur="4.56">of builders and we very much believe in</text><text start="895.36" dur="3.279">connecting those to each other so</text><text start="897.68" dur="2.08">right</text><text start="898.639" dur="2.801">um</text><text start="899.76" dur="3.68">that actually sort of reminds me of uh</text><text start="901.44" dur="4.16">two experiments we&apos;ve done outside of</text><text start="903.44" dur="6.32">the cryptosphere with quadratic funding</text><text start="905.6" dur="6.4">is a campaign in may of 2020 to do</text><text start="909.76" dur="5.84">quadratic funding for downtown boulder</text><text start="912.0" dur="5.199">and to prove that everyday retail stores</text><text start="915.6" dur="3.12">that were being threatened by the lack</text><text start="917.199" dur="3.681">of retail foot traffic during the</text><text start="918.72" dur="3.119">pandemic i think we had a comic book</text><text start="920.88" dur="1.92">store</text><text start="921.839" dur="3.921">a</text><text start="922.8" dur="4.479">bookstore a yoga studio and two other</text><text start="925.76" dur="3.84">retail businesses</text><text start="927.279" dur="4.961">we ran a 50k quadratic funding round in</text><text start="929.6" dur="4.32">downtown boulder and got over 250</text><text start="932.24" dur="2.959">donations to those businesses so i think</text><text start="933.92" dur="3.599">it was really interesting to see</text><text start="935.199" dur="5.121">quadratic funding work outside of crypto</text><text start="937.519" dur="4.961">there and then in i think it was</text><text start="940.32" dur="4.319">november no i&apos;m sorry it was it was may</text><text start="942.48" dur="4.4">of 2021 we actually did a quadratic</text><text start="944.639" dur="4.56">funding campaign uh in partnership with</text><text start="946.88" dur="5.04">open collective and funded regular</text><text start="949.199" dur="4.801">traditional open source not crypto open</text><text start="951.92" dur="5.359">source with quadratic funding and was</text><text start="954.0" dur="4.72">able to raise 100k based off of that so</text><text start="957.279" dur="3.041">one of the most interesting things to me</text><text start="958.72" dur="4.32">is that the mechanism scales whether</text><text start="960.32" dur="5.04">you&apos;re in the crypto niche or you&apos;re not</text><text start="963.04" dur="4.239">and so maybe that could be one way that</text><text start="965.36" dur="4.479">we get to a better internet which</text><text start="967.279" dur="5.601">involves more people involved in funding</text><text start="969.839" dur="4.24">and managing digital infrastructure um</text><text start="972.88" dur="3.68">does that sort of comport with your</text><text start="974.079" dur="4.481">vision or how would you augment and and</text><text start="976.56" dur="3.36">i would say that i think one really</text><text start="978.56" dur="4.0">important</text><text start="979.92" dur="5.039">element of that is finding those</text><text start="982.56" dur="5.199">targeted communities like boulder and</text><text start="984.959" dur="6.24">showing that you&apos;re able to get</text><text start="987.759" dur="5.281">real signal through people&apos;s experiences</text><text start="991.199" dur="4.08">with that i mean you really at some</text><text start="993.04" dur="4.32">level want to do like</text><text start="995.279" dur="4.321">almost a natural like a controlled</text><text start="997.36" dur="4.159">experiment where you have some grant</text><text start="999.6" dur="4.88">making authority go and try to like give</text><text start="1001.519" dur="5.281">money in some context you give like ubi</text><text start="1004.48" dur="4.719">to people in some context and then you</text><text start="1006.8" dur="3.839">give matching funds you know all uh</text><text start="1009.199" dur="3.681">bitcoin grants</text><text start="1010.639" dur="4.64">in in three contexts that are kind of</text><text start="1012.88" dur="6.319">parallel like imagine that like you know</text><text start="1015.279" dur="5.68">for to do relief for uh covent you</text><text start="1019.199" dur="2.88">either sent checks to everyone in the</text><text start="1020.959" dur="4.0">community</text><text start="1022.079" dur="4.24">you did your some form of your downtown</text><text start="1024.959" dur="3.681">stimulus</text><text start="1026.319" dur="3.201">in every in in a community</text><text start="1028.64" dur="4.72">and</text><text start="1029.52" dur="5.84">you did uh like someone giving grants</text><text start="1033.36" dur="4.319">all with the same amount of money</text><text start="1035.36" dur="5.12">uh in three different communities in</text><text start="1037.679" dur="4.4">some place you know like that are</text><text start="1040.48" dur="4.479">nearby but you know and pretty</text><text start="1042.079" dur="4.88">equivalent but not the same towns right</text><text start="1044.959" dur="3.921">and see what the impact is you know i</text><text start="1046.959" dur="3.201">think that would be super interesting</text><text start="1048.88" dur="4.32">so i think like this controlled</text><text start="1050.16" dur="4.72">experiment between a central pool ubi</text><text start="1053.2" dur="3.359">and a quadratic funding style matching</text><text start="1054.88" dur="3.36">pool is sort of interesting in</text><text start="1056.559" dur="4.321">understanding how different mechanisms</text><text start="1058.24" dur="4.48">work and in funding things but do you</text><text start="1060.88" dur="4.32">think that uh</text><text start="1062.72" dur="4.24">that the the actual</text><text start="1065.2" dur="3.359">that those things have to be zero-sum</text><text start="1066.96" dur="3.12">with each other i mean could we not have</text><text start="1068.559" dur="3.601">all three of those things stacked on top</text><text start="1070.08" dur="3.92">of each other uh in funding our digital</text><text start="1072.16" dur="4.639">infrastructure all together sure</text><text start="1074.0" dur="4.88">absolutely i mean all of them are gonna</text><text start="1076.799" dur="3.521">have to play roles and even within</text><text start="1078.88" dur="3.6">any context there&apos;s probably gonna have</text><text start="1080.32" dur="5.52">to be some amounts of of each of these</text><text start="1082.48" dur="5.92">different things but um right but i i i</text><text start="1085.84" dur="5.839">tend towards and even beyond the way</text><text start="1088.4" dur="6.48">that quadratic funding does i tend</text><text start="1091.679" dur="5.281">towards things that are decentralized</text><text start="1094.88" dur="3.6">but community oriented rather than</text><text start="1096.96" dur="4.719">either individualistic in the way that</text><text start="1098.48" dur="4.72">ubi is or centralized</text><text start="1101.679" dur="2.961">i want to ask you about other</text><text start="1103.2" dur="3.2">decentralized and community-oriented</text><text start="1104.64" dur="3.279">mechanisms that you&apos;re excited about but</text><text start="1106.4" dur="3.92">before we do that i want to untangle a</text><text start="1107.919" dur="3.841">few more concepts with quadratic funding</text><text start="1110.32" dur="3.04">um i&apos;m wondering if you wouldn&apos;t mind</text><text start="1111.76" dur="2.96">telling us a little bit about the idea</text><text start="1113.36" dur="4.08">that you shared with me six or nine</text><text start="1114.72" dur="4.319">months ago about uh this sort of like</text><text start="1117.44" dur="4.64">gradient between public and private</text><text start="1119.039" dur="4.88">goods and how quadratic funding could be</text><text start="1122.08" dur="3.599">uh augmented by measuring the social</text><text start="1123.919" dur="3.281">distance between participants and maybe</text><text start="1125.679" dur="3.201">changing the incentives based off of</text><text start="1127.2" dur="4.32">that i&apos;m</text><text start="1128.88" dur="3.84">you&apos;re i&apos;d be curious in your words what</text><text start="1131.52" dur="3.039">whether you&apos;re still excited about that</text><text start="1132.72" dur="4.0">mechanism and what problem it solves</text><text start="1134.559" dur="3.521">yeah so a couple of things so first let</text><text start="1136.72" dur="2.64">me talk about the gradient between</text><text start="1138.08" dur="2.479">public and private goods without</text><text start="1139.36" dur="3.6">bringing in this thing of social</text><text start="1140.559" dur="3.841">distance so sure um</text><text start="1142.96" dur="3.12">right now quadratic funding is being</text><text start="1144.4" dur="3.2">used pretty much for things that have no</text><text start="1146.08" dur="3.52">business model where they&apos;re just like</text><text start="1147.6" dur="3.76">putting out completely free stuff</text><text start="1149.6" dur="4.0">i would really love to see quadratic</text><text start="1151.36" dur="4.16">funding go into context where that&apos;s not</text><text start="1153.6" dur="4.0">necessarily the case so like for example</text><text start="1155.52" dur="3.44">imagine that i&apos;m funding a road a road</text><text start="1157.6" dur="2.88">is basically public infrastructure in</text><text start="1158.96" dur="3.92">fact it&apos;s like gave the name to public</text><text start="1160.48" dur="4.079">infrastructure right but</text><text start="1162.88" dur="3.6">roads do get crowded and so you want</text><text start="1164.559" dur="3.201">congestion pricing on roads and once you</text><text start="1166.48" dur="2.72">have congestion pricing roads have</text><text start="1167.76" dur="2.48">somewhat of a business model right like</text><text start="1169.2" dur="3.04">they&apos;re going to make some money off</text><text start="1170.24" dur="3.36">that congestion pricing right</text><text start="1172.24" dur="2.48">um</text><text start="1173.6" dur="3.28">so you should have the congestion</text><text start="1174.72" dur="4.0">pricing but you also don&apos;t want like</text><text start="1176.88" dur="3.52">people charging some ridiculous toll and</text><text start="1178.72" dur="3.36">the road going getting underutilized</text><text start="1180.4" dur="3.6">right that was the whole reason to make</text><text start="1182.08" dur="3.76">it public in the first place you want</text><text start="1184.0" dur="2.96">some balance between those things and</text><text start="1185.84" dur="3.28">and in fact there&apos;s there are going to</text><text start="1186.96" dur="4.079">be a number of things that do naturally</text><text start="1189.12" dur="3.76">have some elements of scarcity and you</text><text start="1191.039" dur="3.041">want to ration things in them and those</text><text start="1192.88" dur="2.72">that will raise some money but not</text><text start="1194.08" dur="3.68">enough to support the</text><text start="1195.6" dur="4.24">the project so i actually really support</text><text start="1197.76" dur="3.279">the notion of having quadratic funding</text><text start="1199.84" dur="4.0">for things that have somewhat of a</text><text start="1201.039" dur="5.76">business model um or even things that</text><text start="1203.84" dur="5.28">maybe are like profitable businesses but</text><text start="1206.799" dur="4.481">they could be much more exploitative and</text><text start="1209.12" dur="4.64">choose to act in the public interest or</text><text start="1211.28" dur="4.399">to be certified b corporations or do you</text><text start="1213.76" dur="3.68">know like open collective like exit to</text><text start="1215.679" dur="3.161">community or whatever things that have</text><text start="1217.44" dur="3.76">business models that can be</text><text start="1218.84" dur="4.76">self-sustaining but that like aren&apos;t</text><text start="1221.2" dur="3.44">really going to thrive unless</text><text start="1223.6" dur="3.36">or aren&apos;t really going to be able to</text><text start="1224.64" dur="4.56">sustain being exit to community or</text><text start="1226.96" dur="4.959">whatever unless they have some of that</text><text start="1229.2" dur="5.68">matching funds so like there&apos;s kind of a</text><text start="1231.919" dur="4.88">spectrum between things that are like</text><text start="1234.88" dur="4.08">totally just like the only way you could</text><text start="1236.799" dur="4.481">possibly do it is completely as sort of</text><text start="1238.96" dur="3.839">a charity plus you know quadratic</text><text start="1241.28" dur="4.879">funding</text><text start="1242.799" dur="4.88">two things that are like businesses but</text><text start="1246.159" dur="2.88">that could be really exploitative</text><text start="1247.679" dur="3.441">businesses or they could be really</text><text start="1249.039" dur="3.441">pro-social businesses and if you have</text><text start="1251.12" dur="3.6">that matching funds there it gives them</text><text start="1252.48" dur="4.48">an incentive to be that pro-social</text><text start="1254.72" dur="4.0">orientation you know what i mean</text><text start="1256.96" dur="2.56">so so that&apos;s the first spectrum to think</text><text start="1258.72" dur="3.04">about</text><text start="1259.52" dur="5.12">the the second one is to think about the</text><text start="1261.76" dur="5.68">fact that most goods and in fact this is</text><text start="1264.64" dur="5.519">what quadratic funding discovers</text><text start="1267.44" dur="4.719">are in some sense community goods</text><text start="1270.159" dur="3.201">they&apos;re neither like pure public goods</text><text start="1272.159" dur="3.841">that just like</text><text start="1273.36" dur="4.88">freely open to everyone or pure private</text><text start="1276.0" dur="4.4">goods that just one person consumes like</text><text start="1278.24" dur="4.559">one example is right now out my window</text><text start="1280.4" dur="4.24">behind you um i&apos;m looking at lake</text><text start="1282.799" dur="4.321">washington where i like to go paddle</text><text start="1284.64" dur="4.32">boarding right and you know you could</text><text start="1287.12" dur="3.36">divide up the water in lake washington</text><text start="1288.96" dur="3.199">and give everyone like some chunk of</text><text start="1290.48" dur="3.04">water that they could drink or do</text><text start="1292.159" dur="3.841">whatever but like no one could go paddle</text><text start="1293.52" dur="4.96">boarding and no one could uh no one</text><text start="1296.0" dur="3.52">could do all the things that you do</text><text start="1298.48" dur="4.4">you know</text><text start="1299.52" dur="6.24">whether it&apos;s jet skiing or or sailing or</text><text start="1302.88" dur="3.679">swimming in that bigger body of water</text><text start="1305.76" dur="3.2">right</text><text start="1306.559" dur="2.401">and</text><text start="1309.52" dur="4.08">those type of goods</text><text start="1311.84" dur="2.959">uh</text><text start="1313.6" dur="3.439">are</text><text start="1314.799" dur="3.521">i think the generic thing like actually</text><text start="1317.039" dur="2.88">most of the value we get out of our</text><text start="1318.32" dur="3.599">lives come out of those types of things</text><text start="1319.919" dur="4.321">they&apos;re they&apos;re community goods</text><text start="1321.919" dur="3.681">rather than either global public goods</text><text start="1324.24" dur="4.08">or private goods</text><text start="1325.6" dur="4.16">and once you take that into account it</text><text start="1328.32" dur="2.8">actually really changes your perspective</text><text start="1329.76" dur="3.919">on a lot of things because what you come</text><text start="1331.12" dur="4.16">to realize is that most people you&apos;re</text><text start="1333.679" dur="4.081">interacting with are not some like</text><text start="1335.28" dur="5.519">anonymous rando person that you only</text><text start="1337.76" dur="5.36">have a market interaction with</text><text start="1340.799" dur="4.641">there are actually people that you have</text><text start="1343.12" dur="4.559">stronger or weaker social ties to</text><text start="1345.44" dur="3.52">depending on how many of those community</text><text start="1347.679" dur="2.401">goods you share</text><text start="1348.96" dur="3.28">and this is definitely true in the</text><text start="1350.08" dur="3.76">crypto world right like people are</text><text start="1352.24" dur="3.12">people are involved in like 17 different</text><text start="1353.84" dur="3.04">projects with like different subsets of</text><text start="1355.36" dur="4.0">people in the crypto world all the time</text><text start="1356.88" dur="4.0">right and the prosperity of people who</text><text start="1359.36" dur="3.439">are in one of those projects with you is</text><text start="1360.88" dur="2.799">like super important to your success as</text><text start="1362.799" dur="1.76">well</text><text start="1363.679" dur="1.841">right</text><text start="1364.559" dur="3.6">and</text><text start="1365.52" dur="4.399">um this means that it&apos;s like just</text><text start="1368.159" dur="4.64">running a mechanism like qf runs into a</text><text start="1369.919" dur="4.321">lot of trouble because</text><text start="1372.799" dur="2.401">yeah there&apos;s collusion or whatever that</text><text start="1374.24" dur="2.48">you&apos;re not supposed to do but then</text><text start="1375.2" dur="3.12">there&apos;s just like the relationships that</text><text start="1376.72" dur="3.92">you have with people</text><text start="1378.32" dur="4.08">right quadratic funding is this problem</text><text start="1380.64" dur="3.519">that if like a bunch of people</text><text start="1382.4" dur="4.0">care about each other and care about</text><text start="1384.159" dur="3.52">what&apos;s important to each other this like</text><text start="1386.4" dur="3.36">actually undermines the functioning</text><text start="1387.679" dur="3.441">quadratic funding which is weird because</text><text start="1389.76" dur="2.48">the whole point of quadratic funding is</text><text start="1391.12" dur="3.28">to get people to have that kind of</text><text start="1392.24" dur="3.84">solidarity so like it should be like</text><text start="1394.4" dur="3.279">thrilled if there&apos;s already solidarity</text><text start="1396.08" dur="4.0">that pre-exists it shouldn&apos;t be like</text><text start="1397.679" dur="5.041">freaked out about that right but</text><text start="1400.08" dur="4.719">um but somehow it like it it&apos;s set up in</text><text start="1402.72" dur="3.839">a way where it it like assumes that</text><text start="1404.799" dur="3.601">everyone&apos;s an atomized individual and</text><text start="1406.559" dur="4.721">then tries to itself build all the</text><text start="1408.4" dur="4.72">solidarity rather than</text><text start="1411.28" dur="3.04">understanding that that solidarity will</text><text start="1413.12" dur="2.4">exist</text><text start="1414.32" dur="4.08">and</text><text start="1415.52" dur="4.399">you know like harnessing that or giving</text><text start="1418.4" dur="3.12">incentives for solidarity where it</text><text start="1419.919" dur="4.081">doesn&apos;t already exist or something like</text><text start="1421.52" dur="4.72">that you know what i mean and so i think</text><text start="1424.0" dur="4.32">we need mechanisms that do a better job</text><text start="1426.24" dur="4.319">of achieving that</text><text start="1428.32" dur="4.32">got it so it it sounds like in the</text><text start="1430.559" dur="3.841">context of quadratic funding in crypto</text><text start="1432.64" dur="3.68">instead of viewing the collusion problem</text><text start="1434.4" dur="4.24">which is basically you know if i go</text><text start="1436.32" dur="3.68">around to all my friends who i have a</text><text start="1438.64" dur="3.2">relationship with and tell them to</text><text start="1440.0" dur="3.679">contribute to my project instead of</text><text start="1441.84" dur="3.92">viewing that as a binary is it collusion</text><text start="1443.679" dur="4.401">or is it not you just kind of take into</text><text start="1445.76" dur="4.799">account the existing social structure of</text><text start="1448.08" dur="6.079">the system and the fact that if we have</text><text start="1450.559" dur="5.36">a relationship uh or if you&apos;re really</text><text start="1454.159" dur="3.841">close to my project that&apos;s kind of a</text><text start="1455.919" dur="4.561">different situation than if it&apos;s a</text><text start="1458.0" dur="4.32">totally public good uh</text><text start="1460.48" dur="4.16">if for which i have no relationship with</text><text start="1462.32" dur="4.8">you or no proximity to the project am i</text><text start="1464.64" dur="3.68">saying that back to you yeah exactly let</text><text start="1467.12" dur="2.88">me give you the example of the org</text><text start="1468.32" dur="3.28">structure of a company right like you</text><text start="1470.0" dur="3.12">know companies have these org structures</text><text start="1471.6" dur="2.88">right where like there are these</text><text start="1473.12" dur="3.2">different organizations and there&apos;s some</text><text start="1474.48" dur="3.679">organizations and whatever</text><text start="1476.32" dur="2.64">and um</text><text start="1478.159" dur="2.481">the</text><text start="1478.96" dur="3.36">the problem that the company faces is</text><text start="1480.64" dur="3.6">not really</text><text start="1482.32" dur="3.12">like oh no one will do anything for the</text><text start="1484.24" dur="3.76">company at all</text><text start="1485.44" dur="5.119">the problem the company faces is that</text><text start="1488.0" dur="4.48">though like further from someone in org</text><text start="1490.559" dur="3.681">space you are the harder it is for you</text><text start="1492.48" dur="2.72">to get credit for collaboration with</text><text start="1494.24" dur="3.52">them</text><text start="1495.2" dur="5.599">and therefore like the more likely you</text><text start="1497.76" dur="4.56">are to like build redundant things that</text><text start="1500.799" dur="2.88">are wasteful of the overall company&apos;s</text><text start="1502.32" dur="2.959">resources and they don&apos;t play well</text><text start="1503.679" dur="3.521">together right</text><text start="1505.279" dur="2.721">and so what the company really wants to</text><text start="1507.2" dur="3.2">do</text><text start="1508.0" dur="4.64">is provide an incentive mechanism so</text><text start="1510.4" dur="4.08">that if people like from different orgs</text><text start="1512.64" dur="4.08">randomly meet in the cafeteria</text><text start="1514.48" dur="4.16">and have a great idea together that they</text><text start="1516.72" dur="3.36">would have like just as much night an</text><text start="1518.64" dur="3.36">incentive to pursue that if it&apos;s in the</text><text start="1520.08" dur="4.24">company&apos;s interests as if they had both</text><text start="1522.0" dur="4.559">been in exactly the same org right</text><text start="1524.32" dur="5.92">um like that&apos;s that&apos;s what that&apos;s what</text><text start="1526.559" dur="5.441">the company wants not just like</text><text start="1530.24" dur="3.28">everyone to build public goods as if</text><text start="1532.0" dur="3.52">there was no existing social structure</text><text start="1533.52" dur="4.159">there at all you know</text><text start="1535.52" dur="4.88">and um</text><text start="1537.679" dur="4.321">that that&apos;s like a better representation</text><text start="1540.4" dur="2.639">of the problem that we face in the world</text><text start="1542.0" dur="1.84">as well</text><text start="1543.039" dur="2.481">um</text><text start="1543.84" dur="3.839">we we live</text><text start="1545.52" dur="4.48">like in quadratic funding there&apos;s like</text><text start="1547.679" dur="4.0">all these there&apos;s like a list of people</text><text start="1550.0" dur="3.6">and then these list of people each put</text><text start="1551.679" dur="4.0">in like some tokens and then these</text><text start="1553.6" dur="3.84">tokens have some like operation applied</text><text start="1555.679" dur="3.521">to them each separately</text><text start="1557.44" dur="3.119">and that&apos;s like</text><text start="1559.2" dur="3.52">that&apos;s like treating people as if</text><text start="1560.559" dur="3.761">they&apos;re equally spaced atoms in some</text><text start="1562.72" dur="3.28">like you know</text><text start="1564.32" dur="3.52">infinite you know high dimensional space</text><text start="1566.0" dur="3.919">but in reality people like live closer</text><text start="1567.84" dur="4.16">to each other and many senses of that</text><text start="1569.919" dur="4.721">they live on a network of relationships</text><text start="1572.0" dur="4.48">and and like a system should somehow</text><text start="1574.64" dur="3.2">rock that sure</text><text start="1576.48" dur="2.96">got it and so what i&apos;m hearing is that</text><text start="1577.84" dur="3.52">you&apos;re looking for those areas of</text><text start="1579.44" dur="3.76">unlikely consensus</text><text start="1581.36" dur="4.559">in which people are voting for the</text><text start="1583.2" dur="4.0">projects that uh they agree upon even</text><text start="1585.919" dur="4.161">though they&apos;re different in different</text><text start="1587.2" dur="5.359">places in the org chart or uh to use</text><text start="1590.08" dur="5.36">your your lake example like people who</text><text start="1592.559" dur="5.281">are far away from the lake are voting</text><text start="1595.44" dur="4.08">are are spending money on that lake and</text><text start="1597.84" dur="4.319">like it&apos;s those areas of unlikely</text><text start="1599.52" dur="4.159">consensus is where the purest public</text><text start="1602.159" dur="3.76">goods are the most important public</text><text start="1603.679" dur="4.401">goods another word that sociologists use</text><text start="1605.919" dur="4.24">is is the distinction between bridging</text><text start="1608.08" dur="4.64">ties and bonding ties</text><text start="1610.159" dur="5.76">um bonding ties are like those that sort</text><text start="1612.72" dur="4.319">of are already existing etc bridging</text><text start="1615.919" dur="2.64">ties are when you take different</text><text start="1617.039" dur="2.64">communities</text><text start="1618.559" dur="4.0">and find something for them to</text><text start="1619.679" dur="4.561">collaborate on you know and and in fact</text><text start="1622.559" dur="3.921">it&apos;s a dynamic process like in fact the</text><text start="1624.24" dur="4.24">way i think about this is that we what</text><text start="1626.48" dur="3.92">we want is an evolving social graph so</text><text start="1628.48" dur="3.12">there&apos;s there&apos;s solidarity that already</text><text start="1630.4" dur="3.2">exists</text><text start="1631.6" dur="4.64">um but then there&apos;s opportunities for</text><text start="1633.6" dur="4.72">new forms of solidarity that get created</text><text start="1636.24" dur="3.919">like you know there might be a bunch of</text><text start="1638.32" dur="3.92">people who all live in a city and</text><text start="1640.159" dur="3.841">they&apos;re like you know a union or</text><text start="1642.24" dur="2.96">whatever and now there&apos;s people in other</text><text start="1644.0" dur="2.88">cities who are forming unions but then</text><text start="1645.2" dur="2.88">they realize oh no if we collaborate we</text><text start="1646.88" dur="3.12">can do the following thing together and</text><text start="1648.08" dur="3.599">like what you want to do and then they</text><text start="1650.0" dur="3.6">have solidarity with each other so</text><text start="1651.679" dur="4.24">actually with the role of the mechanism</text><text start="1653.6" dur="4.24">is to evolve the social graph to take</text><text start="1655.919" dur="4.401">advantage of the new opportunities for</text><text start="1657.84" dur="4.719">cooperation that don&apos;t historically</text><text

so much</text><text start="2222.88" dur="4.16">force for for public good um and an</text><text start="2225.52" dur="3.599">example of this is that coin center</text><text start="2227.04" dur="4.0">alaska coin grants round coin center is</text><text start="2229.119" dur="5.361">an advocacy group for</text><text start="2231.04" dur="6.0">for uh crypto to educate lawmakers about</text><text start="2234.48" dur="5.119">yeah yeah um and and one of what was</text><text start="2237.04" dur="6.079">interesting is that a dollar donation</text><text start="2239.599" dur="4.401">led to a 500 match in in quadratic</text><text start="2243.119" dur="2.561">funding because they were in the</text><text start="2244.0" dur="3.359">advocacy round and they were in a couple</text><text start="2245.68" dur="3.36">different rounds and people on twitter</text><text start="2247.359" dur="4.72">were saying wow this is too good to be</text><text start="2249.04" dur="5.44">true because the matching was so high um</text><text start="2252.079" dur="4.0">and and you know so when we go back to</text><text start="2254.48" dur="4.0">the question of how do we move people</text><text start="2256.079" dur="3.76">out of twitter and into polis or out of</text><text start="2258.48" dur="2.72">centralized funding systems and</text><text start="2259.839" dur="3.52">indicating grants i think there&apos;s a</text><text start="2261.2" dur="4.08">compounding nature to multiple</text><text start="2263.359" dur="4.081">ecosystems being together on the same</text><text start="2265.28" dur="3.68">platform and using that mechanism</text><text start="2267.44" dur="2.88">hopefully that can help us climb out of</text><text start="2268.96" dur="2.96">the hole that we&apos;re in well and also</text><text start="2270.32" dur="2.799">another element to that is i think</text><text start="2271.92" dur="3.199">eventually you guys might have an</text><text start="2273.119" dur="3.841">interesting kind of federal structure</text><text start="2275.119" dur="2.801">where what you might want to do</text><text start="2276.96" dur="3.119">is</text><text start="2277.92" dur="4.32">give matching</text><text start="2280.079" dur="4.561">you know give grants to things that are</text><text start="2282.24" dur="4.8">all quadratic funding</text><text start="2284.64" dur="3.92">organizations or dows or whatever and</text><text start="2287.04" dur="4.24">then what you&apos;re actually giving money</text><text start="2288.56" dur="3.68">to the to in those cases is a matching</text><text start="2291.28" dur="3.12">pool</text><text start="2292.24" dur="3.599">that then is going to match grants</text><text start="2294.4" dur="3.04">on that topic</text><text start="2295.839" dur="3.601">you know you can imagine having like a</text><text start="2297.44" dur="4.56">hierarchical structure like that you</text><text start="2299.44" dur="5.28">know where where there&apos;s like a high</text><text start="2302.0" dur="4.16">level like topic based thing like yeah i</text><text start="2304.72" dur="3.2">think this thing should be this great</text><text start="2306.16" dur="3.52">area should be supported but then that</text><text start="2307.92" dur="2.96">would have a quadratic funding and like</text><text start="2309.68" dur="3.52">and different types of people would</text><text start="2310.88" dur="5.04">participate in each of these types of</text><text start="2313.2" dur="4.08">of around anyways just just a thought</text><text start="2315.92" dur="4.48">we should turn to a couple of other</text><text start="2317.28" dur="6.0">mechanisms that are exciting uh</text><text start="2320.4" dur="4.48">uh out there yeah um but let&apos;s do it you</text><text start="2323.28" dur="3.2">want to list off the ones that are most</text><text start="2324.88" dur="5.36">exciting to you well i think one thing</text><text start="2326.48" dur="6.24">that i i think is is super important is</text><text start="2330.24" dur="4.08">um some kind of</text><text start="2332.72" dur="2.96">i don&apos;t know if people know the spritely</text><text start="2334.32" dur="2.24">project</text><text start="2335.68" dur="3.28">um</text><text start="2336.56" dur="5.84">but there&apos;s a number of these uh</text><text start="2338.96" dur="5.44">mechanisms out there for</text><text start="2342.4" dur="3.6">interesting new forms of identity</text><text start="2344.4" dur="4.32">decentralized identity i don&apos;t know is</text><text start="2346.0" dur="4.8">the only best word to use for it but</text><text start="2348.72" dur="4.48">things that allow us to</text><text start="2350.8" dur="3.68">represent and manage</text><text start="2353.2" dur="3.919">who we are</text><text start="2354.48" dur="4.16">in ways that capture sort of the</text><text start="2357.119" dur="3.601">richness of all the different contexts</text><text start="2358.64" dur="3.84">that go into our lives</text><text start="2360.72" dur="3.04">um</text><text start="2362.48" dur="4.4">uh so</text><text start="2363.76" dur="5.44">sprightly is a great example like that</text><text start="2366.88" dur="4.719">um but there&apos;s a number of other khalia</text><text start="2369.2" dur="5.12">young is like the ultimate repository of</text><text start="2371.599" dur="4.24">all the great projects uh in this area</text><text start="2374.32" dur="2.64">so i think that&apos;s a super exciting</text><text start="2375.839" dur="4.321">direction</text><text start="2376.96" dur="5.6">um i think another set of uh you know</text><text start="2380.16" dur="4.56">mechanisms in this direction</text><text start="2382.56" dur="4.799">are um</text><text start="2384.72" dur="4.24">things coming out of like ipfs</text><text start="2387.359" dur="2.961">um</text><text start="2388.96" dur="4.56">which is</text><text start="2390.32" dur="5.12">uh like sort of horizontal ways for</text><text start="2393.52" dur="5.04">people to share</text><text start="2395.44" dur="4.48">computation and uh</text><text start="2398.56" dur="4.08">and</text><text start="2399.92" dur="4.159">you know files and things like this</text><text start="2402.64" dur="2.959">um but</text><text start="2404.079" dur="3.121">you know of course that just fits in the</text><text start="2405.599" dur="3.921">normal crypto thing but in in the more</text><text start="2407.2" dur="3.28">regenerative version like i really want</text><text start="2409.52" dur="3.36">to see that</text><text start="2410.48" dur="4.48">embedded into a network of trust and</text><text start="2412.88" dur="3.92">relationships where what you really have</text><text start="2414.96" dur="3.44">is not just like you send it out to the</text><text start="2416.8" dur="3.519">marketplace or whatever but where you</text><text start="2418.4" dur="4.24">have communities of people that are</text><text start="2420.319" dur="5.601">pooling together those resources and</text><text start="2422.64" dur="5.04">building on the trust that they have not</text><text start="2425.92" dur="3.439">in the trustlessness but rather the</text><text start="2427.68" dur="4.24">trust within that community i think</text><text start="2429.359" dur="3.921">that&apos;s a super exciting uh set of</text><text start="2431.92" dur="2.64">directions</text><text start="2433.28" dur="3.28">it reminds me a little bit i don&apos;t know</text><text start="2434.56" dur="3.12">if i&apos;m in the same direction as you</text><text start="2436.56" dur="2.64">mentally right now but i remember</text><text start="2437.68" dur="3.36">reading radical markets and learning</text><text start="2439.2" dur="3.6">about data as labor and possible</text><text start="2441.04" dur="5.039">internet economy in which we&apos;ve all kind</text><text start="2442.8" dur="5.44">of formed maybe data labor data unions</text><text start="2446.079" dur="5.121">and we can sell access to data and share</text><text start="2448.24" dur="4.16">data um in a peer-to-peer type of ways</text><text start="2451.2" dur="2.8">is that is that kind of the same</text><text start="2452.4" dur="2.4">direction that you&apos;re thinking yeah well</text><text start="2454.0" dur="2.4">so</text><text start="2454.8" dur="3.84">that&apos;s for data and i think that&apos;s super</text><text start="2456.4" dur="4.24">exciting and that&apos;s definitely an area</text><text start="2458.64" dur="4.08">that i think there&apos;s been a huge amount</text><text start="2460.64" dur="4.16">of activity around um there&apos;s things</text><text start="2462.72" dur="4.0">like uh pool</text><text start="2464.8" dur="2.88">and um</text><text start="2466.72" dur="3.119">uh</text><text start="2467.68" dur="4.399">microsoft has done some there&apos;s a whole</text><text start="2469.839" dur="4.081">range of different projects in that area</text><text start="2472.079" dur="3.601">but there&apos;s also doing that for compute</text><text start="2473.92" dur="4.0">or doing that for storage</text><text start="2475.68" dur="4.24">that i think are really interesting</text><text start="2477.92" dur="3.52">uh as potential alternatives to the</text><text start="2479.92" dur="2.48">cloud you know</text><text start="2481.44" dur="2.32">um</text><text start="2482.4" dur="2.8">another</text><text start="2483.76" dur="4.72">uh set of things that i think is really</text><text start="2485.2" dur="6.24">exciting is um</text><text start="2488.48" dur="4.56">federated learning and other ways of</text><text start="2491.44" dur="4.0">sharing data</text><text start="2493.04" dur="4.16">in privacy-preserving ways and those are</text><text start="2495.44" dur="4.24">very related to these data labor union</text><text start="2497.2" dur="6.24">type things but open mind being a really</text><text start="2499.68" dur="4.8">great example uh of that</text><text start="2503.44" dur="2.72">so those are those are some of my</text><text start="2504.48" dur="3.28">favorite examples</text><text start="2506.16" dur="3.84">right now and in fact there&apos;s this whole</text><text start="2507.76" dur="4.4">umbrella now like digital public goods</text><text start="2510.0" dur="4.4">digital public infrastructure has become</text><text start="2512.16" dur="3.84">really in the last year like a word that</text><text start="2514.4" dur="3.439">like the white house is saying and all</text><text start="2516.0" dur="3.76">sorts of people are saying so it&apos;s a</text><text start="2517.839" dur="3.601">it&apos;s a thought space that&apos;s really</text><text start="2519.76" dur="3.68">exciting to be in</text><text start="2521.44" dur="3.679">right for sure well i think it&apos;s really</text><text start="2523.44" dur="3.36">exciting but i&apos;m obviously drinking the</text><text start="2525.119" dur="4.321">kool-aid talking about digital public</text><text start="2526.8" dur="4.0">goods over here at get coin um what</text><text start="2529.44" dur="3.6">would you say to someone who&apos;s kind of</text><text start="2530.8" dur="3.92">on the periphery of this whole space</text><text start="2533.04" dur="3.6">whether the space is radical markets or</text><text start="2534.72" dur="5.52">regenerative crypto economics or digital</text><text start="2536.64" dur="5.12">public goods um you know what tools or</text><text start="2540.24" dur="3.359">or resources would you recommend for</text><text start="2541.76" dur="3.52">people that are that are just about to</text><text start="2543.599" dur="4.48">jump down the rabbit hole i think the</text><text start="2545.28" dur="5.92">best place to start is an article uh in</text><text start="2548.079" dur="5.52">wired about about audrey tong</text><text start="2551.2" dur="4.08">um called how the</text><text start="2553.599" dur="3.52">digital</text><text start="2555.28" dur="3.36">taiwan&apos;s

start="2584.319" dur="3.441">it is that you know markets have</text><text start="2585.92" dur="4.72">accelerated or like capitalist systems</text><text start="2587.76" dur="5.04">have accelerated with technology and</text><text start="2590.64" dur="3.679">bureaucratic systems</text><text start="2592.8" dur="3.2">which i think you know ai is kind of a</text><text start="2594.319" dur="4.721">bureaucratic system it&apos;s like a system</text><text start="2596.0" dur="5.2">you program and it does things on people</text><text start="2599.04" dur="4.4">um have accelerated but what hasn&apos;t</text><text start="2601.2" dur="4.48">accelerated is participative democratic</text><text start="2603.44" dur="4.08">systems and uh</text><text start="2605.68" dur="4.32">these are giving
