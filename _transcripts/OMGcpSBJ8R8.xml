start="220.5" dur="4.08">today so tell me about kyc Dell</text><text start="223.319" dur="4.021">yeah</text><text start="224.58" dur="5.64">um kyco is a project that focuses on</text><text start="227.34" dur="5.28">like battery compliance so it might be</text><text start="230.22" dur="4.32">slightly different than your usual guest</text><text start="232.62" dur="3.3">uh but super happy to share more about</text><text start="234.54" dur="4.5">it</text><text start="235.92" dur="5.039">um I mean basically uh kyc though wants</text><text start="239.04" dur="4.14">to solve the problem that&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="240.959" dur="5.28">more and more prevalent in the All</text><text start="243.18" dur="5.52">Battery spaces rather like how we can</text><text start="246.239" dur="4.621">use verifications in a way that either</text><text start="248.7" dur="4.5">we don&apos;t need to redo verification but</text><text start="250.86" dur="4.56">actually compliance stays how we can</text><text start="253.2" dur="5.759">help companies or projects or web free</text><text start="255.42" dur="5.58">protocols to become compliant whether</text><text start="258.959" dur="4.561">because they decide to or they do</text><text start="261.0" dur="3.24">services that require them to do</text><text start="263.52" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="264.24" dur="6.78">regulations are kind of coming</text><text start="267.24" dur="5.58">um it&apos;s not really a if it&apos;s a one and</text><text start="271.02" dur="3.72">and kind of building some infrastructure</text><text start="272.82" dur="5.099">around it that can actually serve prep</text><text start="274.74" dur="4.56">Tree in a sort of blockchain any way is</text><text start="277.919" dur="3.06">something that like kind of like</text><text start="279.3" dur="3.0">grinding or driving the whole project</text><text start="280.979" dur="4.44">forward</text><text start="282.3" dur="6.54">right so uh I&apos;m on your website which is</text><text start="285.419" dur="4.981">kyc Dow dot XYZ right now and it says a</text><text start="288.84" dur="5.46">multi-chain platform for issuing</text><text start="290.4" dur="5.76">reusable on-chain kyc verifications so</text><text start="294.3" dur="3.54">who&apos;s the ideal customer for this is it</text><text start="296.16" dur="4.8">just like exchanges who want to make</text><text start="297.84" dur="5.7">sure that their counterparty is not on</text><text start="300.96" dur="5.22">some Blacklist or you know what&apos;s the</text><text start="303.54" dur="5.099">what&apos;s the ideal customer that the the</text><text start="306.18" dur="4.2">kyc dial would integrate with</text><text start="308.639" dur="4.321">so basically</text><text start="310.38" dur="4.56">um I would say like exchanges will be</text><text start="312.96" dur="3.48">like a last category</text><text start="314.94" dur="2.94">um as they already have a compliance</text><text start="316.44" dur="3.0">process in place</text><text start="317.88" dur="3.84">um replacing that through compliance</text><text start="319.44" dur="4.62">processes is extremely complex let&apos;s</text><text start="321.72" dur="3.84">call them web 2 for now</text><text start="324.06" dur="3.72">um ideal customers are really like</text><text start="325.56" dur="4.26">battery projects so think of like Grant</text><text start="327.78" dur="6.0">programs that give out grant grant money</text><text start="329.82" dur="5.879">on like a legal basis or uh platforms</text><text start="333.78" dur="4.979">like dial Frameworks that want to like</text><text start="335.699" dur="5.401">become like legal Dows those that want</text><text start="338.759" dur="4.081">to create like a legal wrapper and they</text><text start="341.1" dur="3.24">kind of like in a jurisdiction where</text><text start="342.84" dur="3.359">they have to verify all their users</text><text start="344.34" dur="3.359">because maybe like everyone decides on</text><text start="346.199" dur="4.261">their treasury</text><text start="347.699" dur="5.22">um it can be used for like potentially</text><text start="350.46" dur="4.86">uh for nft platform for certain use</text><text start="352.919" dur="4.5">cases when when an nft is more consider</text><text start="355.32" dur="5.099">the security in some cases more than a</text><text start="357.419" dur="4.861">utility uh we have conversations with</text><text start="360.419" dur="4.441">with a couple of D5 protocols but those</text><text start="362.28" dur="4.32">are like very distant</text><text start="364.86" dur="3.72">um we had conversations with on an</text><text start="366.6" dur="3.539">offram solution so that kind of like the</text><text start="368.58" dur="3.54">concept of you know you bring your own</text><text start="370.139" dur="3.481">verification to the on-ramp and then</text><text start="372.12" dur="3.24">they can accept it you don&apos;t need to do</text><text start="373.62" dur="3.78">another kyc at the time of like</text><text start="375.36" dur="4.44">on-ramping money</text><text start="377.4" dur="4.38">um so it&apos;s pretty broad uh the goal is</text><text start="379.8" dur="3.78">not to replace the goal is to have bad</text><text start="381.78" dur="3.359">trip projects</text><text start="383.58" dur="4.559">um be able to meet compliance</text><text start="385.139" dur="4.701">requirements got it okay</text><text start="388.139" dur="4.56">yeah I mean I think that there&apos;s</text><text start="389.84" dur="4.18">multiple different types of identity and</text><text start="392.699" dur="3.12">I think you&apos;re probably the first one</text><text start="394.02" dur="4.38">that I&apos;ve talked to that is focused on</text><text start="395.819" dur="4.021">on compliance I I you know I I&apos;d be</text><text start="398.4" dur="3.299">curious before we dive in on that</text><text start="399.84" dur="3.84">specific use case to zoom out a little</text><text start="401.699" dur="3.541">bit first though so you know what&apos;s your</text><text start="403.68" dur="2.94">experience in the digital editing</text><text start="405.24" dur="3.12">identity space I think you worked at</text><text start="406.62" dur="4.26">diff for a little while can you tell us</text><text start="408.36" dur="4.08">about that and what led you to kyc Dell</text><text start="410.88" dur="4.02">yeah sure</text><text start="412.44" dur="4.44">um so basically there is even one more</text><text start="414.9" dur="4.38">before so I got into the whole Space of</text><text start="416.88" dur="5.159">web3 at large uh with my previous</text><text start="419.28" dur="5.52">project uh that was called takanu uh it</text><text start="422.039" dur="5.521">was a banking solution for refugees and</text><text start="424.8" dur="4.739">it was focusing on banking but it became</text><text start="427.56" dur="4.979">extremely very quickly clear that</text><text start="429.539" dur="5.88">identity plays an extra a very big role</text><text start="432.539" dur="4.681">on understanding people and enabling</text><text start="435.419" dur="4.801">them to access Finance</text><text start="437.22" dur="4.86">crypto at that time was playing a role</text><text start="440.22" dur="3.9">and then decentralized Identity or</text><text start="442.08" dur="4.32">blockchain identity at the time as we</text><text start="444.12" dur="3.66">were calling it became very clear it</text><text start="446.4" dur="3.66">would be ideal for people Crossing</text><text start="447.78" dur="4.44">Borders uh who doesn&apos;t really have a</text><text start="450.06" dur="3.9">government or their government is uh is</text><text start="452.22" dur="3.96">the one that they are fleeing from so</text><text start="453.96" dur="4.5">kind of like a very ideal Network that&apos;s</text><text start="456.18" dur="4.919">like not owned by anyone governments got</text><text start="458.46" dur="4.26">shut it down it would make sense</text><text start="461.099" dur="4.32">um of course since then we learned a lot</text><text start="462.72" dur="4.919">about like uh blockchain identity then</text><text start="465.419" dur="4.981">like the term self-certain identity was</text><text start="467.639" dur="4.981">coined and and based and following that</text><text start="470.4" dur="4.38">project I was already drawn very close</text><text start="472.62" dur="4.5">to like identity digital identity and</text><text start="474.78" dur="4.38">and the battery space so I had the</text><text start="477.12" dur="4.799">opportunity to join the decentralized</text><text start="479.16" dur="4.86">identity foundation and really help it</text><text start="481.919" dur="4.68">to scale to what it is now this</text><text start="484.02" dur="5.1">recognized organization uh during my</text><text start="486.599" dur="4.861">time I was basically the only full-time</text><text start="489.12" dur="4.74">paid employee of the foundation so wore</text><text start="491.46" dur="4.56">a lot of hats from running operations</text><text start="493.86" dur="3.66">and legal side of of the foundation as</text><text start="496.02" dur="4.2">well as basically contributing into</text><text start="497.52" dur="4.92">almost every single work item that was</text><text start="500.22" dur="4.14">developed during that time I was I was</text><text start="502.44" dur="4.14">at the foundation</text><text start="504.36" dur="4.32">um so had a chance really to talk</text><text start="506.58" dur="4.5">uh with pretty much every member of</text><text start="508.68" dur="5.46">thief that&apos;s about like 300 companies</text><text start="511.08" dur="5.1">and kind of like help them to onboard or</text><text start="514.14" dur="3.42">or kind of guide them through any of the</text><text start="516.18" dur="3.419">questions that they have or find the</text><text start="517.56" dur="4.14">right person once they&apos;re done</text><text start="519.599" dur="3.781">um as sometimes it was like way too</text><text start="521.7" dur="2.88">technical or way too deeper than I could</text><text start="523.38" dur="3.84">have answered</text><text start="524.58" dur="4.68">so kind like I do have like a pretty</text><text start="527.22" dur="4.08">good understanding of of decentralized</text><text start="529.26" dur="3.78">identifiers and verifiable credentials</text><text start="531.3" dur="3.96">and</text><text start="533.04" dur="4.919">and that knowledge kind of like what</text><text start="535.26" dur="4.74">I&apos;ve been using to starting the concepts</text><text start="537.959" dur="3.901">the early concept of kyc though that we</text><text start="540.0" dur="3.18">have been like establishing and growing</text><text start="541.86" dur="5.22">since the Inception</text><text start="543.18" dur="6.0">right so I mean I I&apos;m I&apos;m curious uh</text><text start="547.08" dur="4.08">exactly how kyc dial works so I see on</text><text start="549.18" dur="4.44">the website kyc nfts are</text><text start="551.16" dur="4.619">non-transferable and unlock novel use</text><text start="553.62" dur="4.5">cases in web3 including trusted</text><text start="555.779" dur="5.521">communities Fair voting dial governance</text><text start="558.12" dur="4.98">defy crypto native on and off ramps uh</text><text start="561.3" dur="3.659">artist team or founder verification and</text><text start="563.1" dur="4.5">pseudonymous fundraising and investment</text><text start="564.959" dur="4.861">so uh it seems like I go through some</text><text start="567.6" dur="4.14">amount of kyc and then I get a</text><text start="569.82" dur="4.5">non-transferable nft</text><text start="571.74" dur="4.68">yeah I mean the tax that&apos;s I would say</text><text start="574.32" dur="3.66">the technical uh situations it&apos;s funny</text><text start="576.42" dur="3.3">enough like we started working with</text><text start="577.98" dur="3.9">non-transferable nfts before they were</text><text start="579.72" dur="4.38">called Soul bands</text><text start="581.88" dur="3.899">um naturally now we are like internally</text><text start="584.1" dur="4.02">also started calling them solvent</text><text start="585.779" dur="4.381">because that got a pretty good pretty</text><text start="588.12" dur="3.839">big Boost from vitalik</text><text start="590.16" dur="4.26">um but in general like we really use</text><text start="591.959" dur="6.301">these nfts to represent the legally</text><text start="594.42" dur="6.479">established trust so what&apos;s important in</text><text start="598.26" dur="4.38">the framework that we really approached</text><text start="600.899" dur="4.741">the whole question from a compliance</text><text start="602.64" dur="5.04">like a legal regulatory perspective and</text><text start="605.64" dur="3.84">we are assigning technology</text><text start="607.68" dur="4.5">um that kind of meets the requirements</text><text start="609.48" dur="4.979">and and the widest area of</text><text start="612.18" dur="6.36">um solutions that our target audience</text><text start="614.459" dur="6.181">kind of have been expressing so we</text><text start="618.54" dur="4.859">in a sense take liability for the</text><text start="620.64" dur="5.4">verifications and so this is not like a</text><text start="623.399" dur="4.5">one-off verification proved Unchained</text><text start="626.04" dur="4.68">that at that day you had a government ID</text><text start="627.899" dur="5.521">and you were able to take a selfie but</text><text start="630.72" dur="5.16">it&apos;s really like how Banks take how</text><text start="633.42" dur="4.14">Banks like issue a credit card to your</text><text start="635.88" dur="3.42">more like a debit card to you that you</text><text start="637.56"

start="647.339" dur="2.641">because there is the blockchain for for</text><text start="648.779" dur="3.661">the payment Trail</text><text start="649.98" dur="4.02">and it&apos;s hidden who you are because the</text><text start="652.44" dur="4.5">nft doesn&apos;t contain any information</text><text start="654.0" dur="5.88">about the user itself it really contains</text><text start="656.94" dur="5.28">a valid or invalid status it&apos;s just the</text><text start="659.88" dur="4.68">difference is that the valid status has</text><text start="662.22" dur="5.34">behind it a whole compliance mechanism</text><text start="664.56" dur="5.519">that continuously ensures that like that</text><text start="667.56" dur="4.86">user is not on a sanction list in the</text><text start="670.079"

dur="5.1">other person they are interacting with</text><text start="685.5" dur="5.16">so really like think really simply like</text><text start="688.2" dur="4.56">not recreating but that&apos;s the closest of</text><text start="690.66" dur="4.26">the debit card framework um uh just</text><text start="692.76" dur="5.04">really designed for that tree</text><text start="694.92" dur="4.859">word so I want to drill in on one point</text><text start="697.8" dur="5.159">that I know that listeners care about</text><text start="699.779" dur="5.581">and that&apos;ll be privacy so when I upload</text><text start="702.959" dur="4.081">my ID it&apos;s got a bunch of different</text><text start="705.36" dur="5.099">information that I probably don&apos;t want</text><text start="707.04" dur="4.859">to be have put out there publicly and I</text><text start="710.459" dur="4.56">know that a lot of blockchain based</text><text start="711.899" dur="5.341">systems have a</text><text

you&apos;re not doing that</text><text start="721.019" dur="4.44">with kyc data so what kind of privacy</text><text start="723.18" dur="5.0">predictions do I have as a user when I</text><text start="725.459" dur="7.38">upload my credentials to the system</text><text start="728.18" dur="6.159">so we we store the data I think like we</text><text start="732.839" dur="4.021">have to be very transparent about that</text><text start="734.339" dur="4.74">because compliance is not not really</text><text start="736.86" dur="4.5">about like a verification itself it&apos;s</text><text start="739.079" dur="3.781">also the continuous monitoring uh for</text><text start="741.36" dur="3.419">continuous monitoring there has to be</text><text start="742.86" dur="5.28">access to data</text><text start="744.779" dur="5.581">um as well as like we will be will be</text><text start="748.14" dur="4.139">required to provide data in case if</text><text start="750.36" dur="3.96">there is a software or there is like a</text><text start="752.279" dur="4.201">full financial transaction like</text><text start="754.32" dur="5.04">in the worst case like the travel rule</text><text start="756.48" dur="5.46">requirements extend to crypto as well</text><text start="759.36" dur="4.2">then technically the users who verified</text><text start="761.94" dur="3.899">through our framework will be able to</text><text start="763.56" dur="4.98">meet those requirements because we can</text><text start="765.839" dur="4.8">support uh interacting we shall I get</text><text start="768.54" dur="5.52">into what&apos;s a travel rule just for</text><text start="770.639" dur="5.161">example yeah so travel rule very simply</text><text start="774.06" dur="4.98">I&apos;m also not a lawyer</text><text start="775.8" dur="4.86">is a is a growing uh requirement</text><text start="779.04" dur="3.419">framework</text><text start="780.66" dur="3.479">um we read about a couple of regulators</text><text start="782.459" dur="3.56">where</text><text start="784.139" dur="5.221">every Trend like International</text><text start="786.019" dur="5.201">transactions that required to know the</text><text start="789.36" dur="3.719">issuer of the account required to</text><text start="791.22" dur="3.559">disclose the name and some personal</text><text start="793.079" dur="4.681">information with the receiver</text><text start="794.779" dur="5.081">institution so my bank has to tell</text><text start="797.76" dur="4.139">Kevin&apos;s Bank who I am before the</text><text start="799.86" dur="3.479">transactions happen but also cabins</text><text start="801.899" dur="4.141">don&apos;t have to do the same before the</text><text start="803.339" dur="4.62">transaction happened to my bank uh and</text><text start="806.04" dur="4.2">now there&apos;s a conversation</text><text start="807.959" dur="4.32">um kind of unfortunately in the EU that</text><text start="810.24" dur="3.36">it might extend to crypto transactions</text><text start="812.279" dur="3.3">as well meaning</text><text start="813.6" dur="3.299">a crypto transaction between two words</text><text start="815.579" dur="3.721">would be considered an international</text><text start="816.899" dur="4.861">transaction that might need to meet</text><text start="819.3" dur="4.38">travel requirements</text><text start="821.76" dur="5.04">um technically speaking we can serve</text><text start="823.68" dur="6.3">this use case as we are able to fulfill</text><text start="826.8" dur="6.0">the requirements that it has uh in terms</text><text start="829.98" dur="5.58">of like privacy so as I said like</text><text start="832.8" dur="3.839">um I&apos;m I&apos;m I&apos;m very conscious of privacy</text><text start="835.56" dur="2.82">so</text><text start="836.639" dur="3.121">um working with refugees and kind of</text><text start="838.38" dur="4.079">like figuring out how we can make</text><text start="839.76" dur="5.519">technologies that works for them is a</text><text start="842.459" dur="5.041">lot more harder than it sounds because</text><text start="845.279" dur="4.5">it&apos;s not just about what&apos;s their privacy</text><text start="847.5" dur="5.1">they think or like they feel is bad but</text><text start="849.779" dur="5.221">also like their data is extremely uh</text><text start="852.6" dur="4.739">sensitive like almost a little bit more</text><text start="855.0" dur="4.32">than every citizen because there are</text><text start="857.339" dur="3.721">governments that are chasing there can</text><text start="859.32" dur="3.9">be a government that&apos;s like chasing them</text><text start="861.06" dur="3.6">so really protecting the data and kind</text><text start="863.22" dur="4.98">of like working around that and making</text><text start="864.66" dur="6.419">Services is a very complex task</text><text start="868.2" dur="4.939">um here what we are doing is using the</text><text start="871.079" dur="5.521">blockchain as kind of the signaling API</text><text start="873.139" dur="5.32">issuing a non-transferable nft it could</text><text start="876.6" dur="3.599">be just a sign message that would not be</text><text start="878.459" dur="3.361">can&apos;t be transferred it&apos;s just the NFD</text><text start="880.199" dur="3.26">has a couple of more meaning can get</text><text start="881.82" dur="4.319">into a bit later</text><text start="883.459" dur="4.301">but it has no personal information and</text><text start="886.139" dur="3.541">that&apos;s like super important it&apos;s really</text><text start="887.76" dur="4.98">signals Trust</text><text start="889.68" dur="5.82">um and and we store the data we have we</text><text start="892.74" dur="5.279">are like we have a pretty context like</text><text start="895.5" dur="4.139">um compliance data service</text><text start="898.019" dur="4.26">um that we are setting up that means</text><text start="899.639" dur="5.88">like GDP or CCPA slc2 and kind of like</text><text start="902.279" dur="5.281">the general requirements but as we are</text><text start="905.519" dur="4.44">not running like a service that really</text><text start="907.56" dur="5.1">wants to mine data we also are able to</text><text start="909.959" dur="6.481">like encrypt on a continuous basis a</text><text start="912.66" dur="6.0">large part we can unencrypt it</text><text start="916.44" dur="4.8">um and in case if it would be for for</text><text start="918.66" dur="5.46">like information transfer as of any</text><text start="921.24" dur="5.399">travel rule or you are facing an on-rem</text><text start="924.12" dur="4.32">that&apos;s required to have the the your</text><text start="926.639" dur="4.32">information because they are a regulated</text><text start="928.44" dur="4.62">entity it only can be happen if there is</text><text start="930.959" dur="3.661">a signed consent message from the user</text><text start="933.06" dur="3.36">so kind of like there is that</text><text start="934.62" dur="4.32">opportunity I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s already</text><text start="936.42" dur="5.58">done we are focusing on making sure that</text><text start="938.94" dur="5.28">it&apos;s usable the the core use cases</text><text start="942.0" dur="3.839">um and really like we will be very</text><text start="944.22" dur="3.9">transparent about like how these things</text><text start="945.839" dur="4.321">are happening uh going forward</text><text start="948.12" dur="4.079">okay got it so if I&apos;m a technologist</text><text start="950.16" dur="3.359">that wants to learn more where do I</text><text start="952.199" dur="2.461">where do I check out how this whole</text><text start="953.519" dur="2.88">system works</text><text start="954.66" dur="3.06">so soon we&apos;re gonna release our</text><text start="956.399" dur="2.88">documentation</text><text start="957.72" dur="3.72">um technically the service is live a</text><text start="959.279" dur="5.041">couple of projects are integrating well</text><text start="961.44" dur="4.68">we who win we covered all of these</text><text start="964.32" dur="4.319">questions uh in their public</text><text start="966.12" dur="5.579">documentation we&apos;ll go live uh in a</text><text start="968.639" dur="5.101">couple of weeks maybe a month and it it</text><text start="971.699" dur="3.301">will cover everything uh and if there</text><text start="973.74" dur="4.62">are any questions we are very happy to</text><text start="975.0" dur="5.1">answer we have a Discord and and we are</text><text start="978.36" dur="3.96">there to answer questions</text><text start="980.1" dur="4.26">what would you say to someone who&apos;s on</text><text start="982.32" dur="5.16">the more safer Punk part of the spectrum</text><text start="984.36" dur="4.4">and would say kyc is censorship you&apos;re</text><text start="987.48" dur="3.479">getting access</text><text start="988.76" dur="4.06">uh we should all be building private</text><text start="990.959" dur="4.62">systems that are outside of the existing</text><text start="992.82" dur="5.879">systems and compliance is a waste of</text><text start="995.579" dur="4.62">time you know like it feels like I I</text><text start="998.699" dur="3.601">know a lot of people in the space that</text><text start="1000.199" dur="5.281">have this sort of perspective on on</text><text start="1002.3" dur="5.399">compliance and you know I&apos;m curious what</text><text start="1005.48" dur="5.52">what your response to that criticism</text><text start="1007.699" dur="5.64">that category of criticism would be</text><text start="1011.0" dur="3.24">I also know a lot of people on on that</text><text start="1013.339" dur="2.401">end</text><text start="1014.24" dur="4.92">um I think</text><text start="1015.74" dur="6.24">as our focus is also not to convince</text><text start="1019.16" dur="4.56">anyone to build the other way</text><text start="1021.98" dur="3.54">um it&apos;s more about the requirements that</text><text start="1023.72" dur="4.38">are extending to companies that are run</text><text start="1025.52" dur="5.1">as companies and not just a protocol</text><text start="1028.1" dur="5.28">that will that are more and more need to</text><text start="1030.62" dur="5.339">meet requirements whether they decide to</text><text start="1033.38" dur="5.459">uh build solutions that are more privacy</text><text start="1035.959" dur="4.261">preserving that&apos;s amazing but there will</text><text start="1038.839" dur="3.36">be companies that decide to meet</text><text start="1040.22" dur="5.28">requirements and they will need to link</text><text start="1042.199" dur="5.161">and whether they use something back to</text><text start="1045.5" dur="4.02">um or something that&apos;s natively built</text><text start="1047.36" dur="5.04">for web3 that&apos;s kind of like we are</text><text start="1049.52" dur="3.779">building something natively for web3</text><text start="1052.4" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="1053.299" dur="5.281">I&apos;m a European citizen our governments</text><text start="1056.12" dur="4.919">are not extremely terrible</text><text start="1058.58" dur="4.86">um in terms of like servicing us but for</text><text start="1061.039" dur="4.801">be able to service us they need a little</text><text start="1063.44" dur="3.84">bit of understanding of who we are</text><text start="1065.84" dur="3.78">um of course like the financial</text><text start="1067.28" dur="5.34">oversight in all these countries are a</text><text start="1069.62" dur="5.52">little bit ridiculous to a degree but</text><text start="1072.62" dur="4.32">but I do understand that like they do</text><text start="1075.14" dur="4.44">need to also protect certain industries</text><text start="1076.94" dur="4.92">of course it usually falls on the other</text><text start="1079.58" dur="4.56">side of the what are those Industries</text><text start="1081.86" dur="4.52">and how much protection they need</text><text start="1084.14" dur="7.26">um I think it&apos;s a super complex question</text><text start="1086.38" dur="7.84">uh I&apos;m I&apos;m a bit realistic that like</text><text start="1091.4" dur="5.639">the regulations will come like we can we</text><text start="1094.22" dur="4.14">can sit and wait that say that they are</text><text start="1097.039" dur="2.88">not coming</text><text start="1098.36" dur="3.24">um we are building Technologies already</text><text start="1099.919" dur="4.741">like there are a number of technologies</text><text start="1101.6" dur="4.92">that can serve a lot of use cases</text><text start="1104.66" dur="4.74">um five years ago we all of us were like</text><text start="1106.52" dur="6.84">Yay like uh we are replacing the banks</text><text start="1109.4" dur="6.06">and it&apos;s going to be a new industry and</text><text start="1113.36" dur="3.66">and now the banks also want to use these</text><text start="1115.46" dur="3.599">Technologies but they bring their own</text><text start="1117.02" dur="4.64">requirements because they run businesses</text><text start="1119.059" dur="4.74">that are regulated they can&apos;t touch</text><text start="1121.66" dur="5.139">non-compliant Services even if they&apos;re</text><text start="1123.799" dur="4.681">like very brave very new companies can</text><text start="1126.799" dur="3.781">do that because they are they don&apos;t have</text><text start="1128.48" dur="3.96">an existing business model and kind of</text><text start="1130.58" dur="3.839">like we need to create the blurring</text><text start="1132.44" dur="4.8">between web through and battery and I</text><text start="1134.419" dur="6.12">see that like using the five Primitives</text><text start="1137.24" dur="5.64">but bringing in or meeting certain</text><text start="1140.539" dur="5.041">compliance requirements that F3 brings</text><text start="1142.88" dur="5.46">in create this like in between layer</text><text start="1145.58" dur="4.8">between web 2 and Battery that can</text><text start="1148.34" dur="4.74">really enable certain growth of the</text><text start="1150.38" dur="4.44">whole industry but it&apos;s clear that the</text><text start="1153.08" dur="3.54">D5 Primitives are like battery</text><text start="1154.82" dur="4.979">Primitives that has been developed in</text><text start="1156.62" dur="5.22">the couple of past years are really the</text><text start="1159.799" dur="5.401">one that like drives this like adoption</text><text start="1161.84" dur="5.82">of of crypto and Battery Technology</text><text start="1165.2" dur="4.02">got it yeah so I mean it seems like a</text><text start="1167.66" dur="2.759">lot of this stuff is non-negotiable if</text><text start="1169.22" dur="3.0">you&apos;re a bank or a company that&apos;s</text><text start="1170.419" dur="2.821">entering the space particularly if</text><text start="1172.22" dur="2.76">you&apos;re in a heavily regulated</text><text start="1173.24" dur="4.62">jurisdiction and you&apos;re trying to build</text><text start="1174.98" dur="4.319">bridges for those people is I guess how</text><text start="1177.86" dur="2.64">I would sum that up but I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="1179.299" dur="3.301">that&apos;s a fair</text><text start="1180.5" dur="4.02">a fair summary</text><text start="1182.6" dur="4.319">yeah I think like</text><text start="1184.52" dur="4.38">um being able to cross between better</text><text start="1186.919" dur="2.661">and that tree is still a really unsolved</text><text start="1188.9" dur="3.62">problem</text><text start="1189.58" dur="5.32">it&apos;s primarily done by very regulated or</text><text start="1192.52" dur="5.26">semi-regulated entities</text><text start="1194.9" dur="5.279">um but no one else can really do that to</text><text start="1197.78" dur="4.2">open that up we need to meet those</text><text start="1200.179" dur="5.701">requirements that pretty much those</text><text start="1201.98" dur="5.52">existing players already meet like or or</text><text start="1205.88" dur="3.12">we can just say that like we build our</text><text start="1207.5" dur="3.78">own economy and we don&apos;t care about the</text><text start="1209.0" dur="4.32">real economy but that has been the same</text><text start="1211.28" dur="4.62">for a long time and and it really didn&apos;t</text><text start="1213.32" dur="4.26">like like crypto payments is still</text><text start="1215.9" dur="3.3">something that like very few Services</text><text start="1217.58" dur="3.839">except crypto</text><text start="1219.2" dur="4.14">and and now we have even more script</text><text start="1221.419" dur="4.921">Unity because like SEC is just like</text><text start="1223.34" dur="5.88">lashing out on on projects and and smart</text><text start="1226.34" dur="4.56">contracts uh but we also</text><text start="1229.22" dur="3.48">can understand or say that like</text><text start="1230.9" dur="4.32">Regulators actually understand what</text><text start="1232.7" dur="4.38">blockchain is so so the saying that</text><text start="1235.22"

have in my</text><text start="1279.02" dur="5.58">notes uh uh uh something that when I</text><text start="1281.72" dur="5.579">when I did research on you all</text><text start="1284.6" dur="4.559">uh nfts versus verifiable credentials</text><text start="1287.299" dur="4.321">which I know has been a Hot Topic I mean</text><text start="1289.159" dur="4.441">that was like four controversies ago</text><text start="1291.62" dur="3.419">that was before tornado cash that was</text><text start="1293.6" dur="4.02">before</text><text start="1295.039" dur="6.0">um soulbound tokens basically the</text><text start="1297.62" dur="5.7">criticism of them was that they were</text><text start="1301.039" dur="4.321">dystopian because there was no consent</text><text start="1303.32"

dur="4.02">that and and where you land on on that</text><text start="1317.6" dur="2.4">debate</text><text start="1318.62" dur="6.48">yeah</text><text start="1320.0" dur="6.9">um I think so let&apos;s starting from macro</text><text start="1325.1" dur="3.48">um let&apos;s be transparent we are</text><text start="1326.9" dur="4.38">developing a solvento camp based</text><text start="1328.58" dur="5.78">solution but we&apos;re also developing a</text><text start="1331.28" dur="6.0">very specific solution that</text><text start="1334.36" dur="4.12">is basically in a way</text><text start="1337.28" dur="4.56">um</text><text start="1338.48" dur="6.48">extremely beneficial to be public at all</text><text start="1341.84" dur="5.16">times and not just in certain cases</text><text start="1344.96" dur="4.199">um I do think that like this closing or</text><text start="1347.0" dur="4.5">creating the solventoken airdropping</text><text start="1349.159" dur="4.081">mechanism because

cannot be like replaced</text><text start="1364.82" dur="4.8">of course you can replace your wallet</text><text start="1367.12" dur="4.48">but really enough resources your</text><text start="1369.62" dur="4.26">previous one then your new wallet can be</text><text start="1371.6" dur="4.5">connected like that&apos;s that kindness has</text><text start="1373.88" dur="4.74">been done uh we know it&apos;s all public at</text><text start="1376.1" dur="4.199">the end so you know the reputation-based</text><text start="1378.62" dur="4.14">solutions trust me they are like looking</text><text start="1380.299" dur="4.441">at these and if you move money from one</text><text start="1382.76" dur="4.14">bullet or to another one that has all</text><text start="1384.74" dur="4.14">these like membership tokens they will</text><text start="1386.9" dur="4.08">be able to connect them as well since</text><text start="1388.88" dur="4.02">you move like 99 of the assets from</text><text start="1390.98" dur="4.8">Walmart to another they are connected so</text><text start="1392.9" dur="4.92">I&apos;m like really not a big fan of using</text><text start="1395.78" dur="5.399">svts without like thinking so there&apos;s</text><text start="1397.82" dur="7.02">another block that we put out during</text><text start="1401.179" dur="6.181">that during that time which kind of like</text><text start="1404.84" dur="4.56">sets out the requirements that we went</text><text start="1407.36" dur="4.62">through thinking about like what exactly</text><text start="1409.4" dur="4.2">our SBT tokens should look like what it</text><text start="1411.98" dur="3.059">should be like like all the</text><text start="1413.6" dur="3.0">considerations</text><text start="1415.039" dur="3.961">um happy to also send you the link and</text><text start="1416.6" dur="4.68">maybe you can put in the show notes</text><text start="1419.0" dur="5.88">um but in general like I think a lot of</text><text start="1421.28" dur="6.54">use cases are not completely ideal</text><text start="1424.88" dur="4.44">um what I would like to see is is is the</text><text start="1427.82" dur="4.02">constant part well of course it&apos;s super</text><text start="1429.32" dur="4.62">important but if you want to have it</text><text start="1431.84" dur="4.56">public then have it public but if you</text><text start="1433.94" dur="4.68">don&apos;t want to have reported then give me</text><text start="1436.4" dur="4.019">a Json give me a verified organization</text><text start="1438.62" dur="3.84">give me something that I can be using</text><text start="1440.419" dur="3.721">whatever ways whether it&apos;s accepted by</text><text start="1442.46" dur="4.86">other parties or not that might be my</text><text start="1444.14" dur="5.34">problem but like don&apos;t force me to have</text><text start="1447.32" dur="3.9">it on chain I want to have other ways</text><text start="1449.48" dur="3.54">because you know if you make a decision</text><text start="1451.22" dur="3.72">you want to have a public like people</text><text start="1453.02" dur="3.3">have been using venmo for transactions</text><text start="1454.94" dur="4.5">like</text><text start="1456.32" dur="4.859">um it&apos;s a decision in a way maybe a bit</text><text start="1459.44" dur="4.5">education could be put around but like</text><text start="1461.179" dur="5.941">at least there was a decision</text><text start="1463.94" dur="5.52">um and and in terms of like VCS or not</text><text start="1467.12" dur="4.22">we see so you know as I said like we are</text><text start="1469.46" dur="4.98">building for that tree</text><text start="1471.34" dur="5.68">VCS are not blockchain native</text><text start="1474.44" dur="5.94">um performance they are off-chain data</text><text start="1477.02" dur="5.84">so what we are building is basically the</text><text start="1480.38" dur="5.7">ability to create protocols that are</text><text start="1482.86" dur="5.92">compliant so that a smart contract can</text><text start="1486.08" dur="6.02">understand and this is as they currently</text><text start="1488.78" dur="7.08">are are living not on a blockchain so</text><text start="1492.1" dur="5.68">like our focus is to bridge that we can</text><text start="1495.86" dur="3.12">issue verifiable credentials as well so</text><text start="1497.78" dur="4.259">we are talking with a couple of the</text><text start="1498.98" dur="4.62">wallet providers or like identity wallet</text><text start="1502.039" dur="3.601">providers</text><text start="1503.6" dur="4.199">um because it&apos;s for us it&apos;s just another</text><text start="1505.64" dur="3.72">sign message but the core product is</text><text start="1507.799" dur="3.36">really built around like battery</text><text start="1509.36" dur="3.84">servicing</text><text start="1511.159" dur="6.121">um</text><text start="1513.2" dur="6.719">plus nfts has a have an image and it</text><text start="1517.28" dur="4.5">creates this relatively dry service that</text><text start="1519.919" dur="4.74">we are providing like like identity</text><text start="1521.78" dur="5.399">verification and it can offer like a</text><text start="1524.659" dur="4.14">personalization so you know like on</text><text start="1527.179" dur="3.6">Twitter you have the blue check mark and</text><text start="1528.799" dur="4.74">you are verified but you don&apos;t own it it</text><text start="1530.779" dur="5.581">can be taken away here technically you</text><text start="1533.539" dur="5.88">own it you can even like personalize</text><text start="1536.36" dur="5.28">um and and that kind of creates like a a</text><text start="1539.419" dur="4.561">little bit better feeling I would say uh</text><text start="1541.64" dur="5.34">on on reviews uh and feedback we have</text><text start="1543.98" dur="5.819">received so that&apos;s a big thing</text><text start="1546.98" dur="4.74">um nfts bring a lot of new new customers</text><text start="1549.799" dur="5.701">into the space it makes things a bit</text><text start="1551.72" dur="6.42">more transparent and understandable so</text><text start="1555.5" dur="5.94">a VC is pretty hard to grasp for someone</text><text start="1558.14" dur="4.8">who is not into identity an nft that</text><text start="1561.44" dur="3.599">represents that you have a valid</text><text start="1562.94" dur="3.9">verification is is something that like</text><text start="1565.039" dur="3.541">pretty much everyone understands</text><text start="1566.84" dur="3.48">yeah I wonder if these things are really</text><text start="1568.58" dur="3.839">Apples to Apples though because it seems</text><text start="1570.32" dur="3.719">to me like you know nfts are something</text><text start="1572.419" dur="3.421">that I want to collect I know how to</text><text start="1574.039" dur="4.14">show that off in my wallet I hang out on</text><text start="1575.84" dur="4.38">open C but you know they&apos;re also very</text><text start="1578.179" dur="4.021">financialized because the user knows</text><text start="1580.22" dur="4.38">about them whenever I use an app that</text><text start="1582.2" dur="5.099">has VCS on it like Bitcoin passport for</text><text start="1584.6" dur="4.86">example the VC is just the data storage</text><text start="1587.299" dur="3.661">in the back end like expecting the user</text><text start="1589.46" dur="3.06">to know about a VC is like expecting</text><text start="1590.96" dur="4.44">them to know about the postgres database</text><text start="1592.52" dur="5.1">that runs your your system so they feel</text><text start="1595.4" dur="4.86">a little bit apples apples to oranges to</text><text start="1597.62" dur="4.62">to me but I&apos;m curious to see how things</text><text start="1600.26" dur="3.799">evolve I mean nfts obviously have a huge</text><text start="1602.24" dur="5.939">Head Start just given how many</text><text start="1604.059" dur="6.161">wallets and sites support ERC 721s but</text><text start="1608.179" dur="4.081">I&apos;ll be curious to see what the shelling</text><text start="1610.22" dur="3.72">point in the in the community is</text><text start="1612.26" dur="3.299">oh no like don&apos;t get me wrong like</text><text start="1613.94" dur="3.78">definitely like</text><text start="1615.559" dur="4.021">you don&apos;t have to understand it&apos;s more</text><text start="1617.72" dur="4.02">like it&apos;s a lot easier to explain what</text><text start="1619.58" dur="5.459">happens</text><text start="1621.74" dur="4.74">yeah and so I&apos;ve worked for Dave and I</text><text start="1625.039" dur="3.12">explained what I did and that we see</text><text start="1626.48" dur="3.179">about like a thousand times during that</text><text start="1628.159" dur="3.661">time</text><text start="1629.659" dur="4.201">um and and kind of the conversation is</text><text start="1631.82" dur="4.14">still about keep explaining what a vcm</text><text start="1633.86" dur="3.96">did because people try to understand the</text><text start="1635.96" dur="2.52">whole framework</text><text start="1637.82" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="1638.48" dur="5.34">and that that&apos;s something that like is a</text><text start="1641.84" dur="3.54">very big pain point of course we can</text><text start="1643.82" dur="3.3">hide them and like just say that like</text><text start="1645.38" dur="3.299">you get a signature that proves that</text><text start="1647.12" dur="3.78">you&apos;re verified and that&apos;s sufficient</text><text start="1648.679" dur="3.901">but like</text><text start="1650.9" dur="3.3">um in blockchain I think there is like a</text><text start="1652.58" dur="3.9">lot more transparency on

start="1857.96" dur="4.74">because</text><text start="1859.039" dur="6.841">how can a project know whether like a</text><text start="1862.7" dur="5.82">U.S compliance or like us kyc versus a</text><text start="1865.88" dur="5.46">Bahama kyc versus</text><text start="1868.52" dur="5.22">um a German kyc really aligns to meet</text><text start="1871.34" dur="4.5">all the requirements if you are serious</text><text start="1873.74" dur="5.4">about compliance that&apos;s that&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1875.84" dur="4.68">be there so we set up kyc Dao which is</text><text start="1879.14" dur="3.659">essentially like</text><text start="1880.52" dur="4.379">a little bit like that three projects</text><text start="1882.799" dur="4.98">come together that care about compliance</text><text start="1884.899" dur="4.741">that accept the kycnfds that we are</text><text start="1887.779" dur="4.02">issuing and they can make decisions</text><text start="1889.64" dur="4.019">whether they trust another issuer to</text><text start="1891.799" dur="4.38">come on board whether that issuer meets</text><text start="1893.659" dur="4.441">the requirements set by that I was like</text><text start="1896.179" dur="4.141">a minimum layer which kind of like</text><text start="1898.1" dur="6.179">establishes like a number of trusted</text><text start="1900.32" dur="5.7">parties but for for the nft the nft</text><text start="1904.279" dur="4.62">doesn&apos;t disclose whether it&apos;s coming</text><text start="1906.02" dur="5.039">from partier or party B so really for</text><text start="1908.899" dur="5.041">the project at the end it&apos;s still this</text><text start="1911.059" dur="6.36">like extremely simple service if this</text><text start="1913.94" dur="5.339">nft is minted it makes this wallet</text><text start="1917.419" dur="4.201">compliant that is trying to access my</text><text start="1919.279" dur="5.041">service so I can provide them those</text><text start="1921.62" dur="4.98">additional framework or that new tooling</text><text start="1924.32" dur="4.56">that is designed for them</text><text start="1926.6" dur="5.16">um and really like that&apos;s where we see</text><text start="1928.88" dur="4.5">the Dao but we don&apos;t really think that</text><text start="1931.76" dur="3.539">this should be like monetized in the</text><text start="1933.38" dur="3.779">governance token we think of it as</text><text start="1935.299" dur="4.74">really like compliance decision made</text><text start="1937.159" dur="7.981">people who understand compliance to</text><text start="1940.039" dur="7.081">whether welcome new new issuers whether</text><text start="1945.14" dur="4.259">to align with new privacy places</text><text start="1947.12" dur="4.38">introduced in certain regions of the</text><text start="1949.399" dur="4.28">world and really to be able to serve</text><text start="1951.5" dur="5.1">like a global compliance needs because</text><text start="1953.679" dur="6.281">what we have like kind of discovered or</text><text start="1956.6" dur="5.16">realized I would say is that fintech</text><text start="1959.96" dur="4.199">companies that are operating</text><text start="1961.76" dur="4.74">their services are really starting in</text><text start="1964.159" dur="4.5">one geolocation you start in the UK you</text><text start="1966.5" dur="3.84">meet your UK Financial Regulators you</text><text start="1968.659" dur="3.961">can set up your compliance according to</text><text start="1970.34" dur="4.079">that you extend to France you made the</text><text start="1972.62" dur="3.72">French regulation you extend to the US</text><text start="1974.419" dur="3.061">you meet the U.S regulation state by</text><text start="1976.34" dur="3.18">state</text><text start="1977.48" dur="3.66">when you&apos;re a D5 projector you&apos;re</text><text start="1979.52" dur="3.72">operating a battery service you&apos;re</text><text start="1981.14" dur="4.38">probably going to have users from every</text><text start="1983.24" dur="5.28">single country that supports blockchain</text><text start="1985.52" dur="6.0">or that doesn&apos;t ban blockchain now</text><text start="1988.52" dur="4.68">Meeting those requirements for unless</text><text start="1991.52" dur="4.86">you&apos;re an extremely big project is super</text><text start="1993.2" dur="6.0">critically complex and so kind of like</text><text start="1996.38" dur="4.56">making the ability that like the users</text><text start="1999.2" dur="3.9">bring their own compliance but that&apos;s</text><text start="2000.94" dur="5.579">created by</text><text start="2003.1" dur="5.22">a collaboration of uh Global compliance</text><text start="2006.519" dur="5.04">officers is something that we see as</text><text start="2008.32" dur="4.92">like a very efficient way forward</text><text start="2011.559" dur="4.141">right</text><text start="2013.24" dur="4.14">okay yeah I was getting some flashbacks</text><text start="2015.7" dur="3.479">as you were speaking just to our</text><text start="2017.38" dur="4.679">experiences with launching a dow and</text><text start="2019.179" dur="4.5">some of the trade-offs there uh it&apos;s a</text><text start="2022.059" dur="4.681">longer path than I think people realize</text><text start="2023.679" dur="5.22">when they when they set it up it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="2026.74" dur="5.46">a step-by-step</text><text start="2028.899" dur="4.981">um like the the focus is first providing</text><text start="2032.2" dur="4.319">the service that can be accepted and</text><text start="2033.88" dur="4.32">that works for that as we are the only</text><text start="2036.519" dur="4.5">sure we don&apos;t need the doubt to make</text><text start="2038.2" dur="4.62">that decision and then kind of as things</text><text start="2041.019" dur="4.861">evolve and we see like there is actually</text><text start="2042.82" dur="5.4">a need we prove everything</text><text start="2045.88" dur="4.2">um then we can start seeing like how</text><text start="2048.22" dur="3.78">exactly to operate this dial probably</text><text start="2050.08" dur="4.38">like Bare Bones at the beginning and</text><text start="2052.0" dur="5.399">more complex as it grows</text><text start="2054.46" dur="5.58">um it&apos;s something that like you know it</text><text start="2057.399" dur="5.581">has been solved without tokens many</text><text start="2060.04" dur="4.68">times these are called like associations</text><text start="2062.98" dur="4.8">um where projects come together and</text><text start="2064.72" dur="5.1">agree on things I run a standardization</text><text start="2067.78" dur="6.059">organization or like I was leading</text><text start="2069.82" dur="6.359">operations there for Dave I see how hard</text><text start="2073.839" dur="4.08">is it to actually get multiple companies</text><text start="2076.179" dur="4.261">with very different interests to align</text><text start="2077.919" dur="5.281">on something so I have some experience</text><text start="2080.44" dur="5.1">on on kind of figuring this out but I</text><text start="2083.2" dur="4.02">also see the value that it creates that</text><text start="2085.54" dur="3.839">it&apos;s not</text><text start="2087.22" dur="4.98">um one company that says left or right</text><text start="2089.379" dur="5.161">you&apos;re a competitor you can&apos;t issue I</text><text start="2092.2" dur="3.959">really want to avoid that naturally</text><text start="2094.54" dur="5.04">there has to be like some streamlining</text><text start="2096.159" dur="5.7">but like the ideal is that we can we can</text><text start="2099.58" dur="4.2">bring together parties and and create a</text><text start="2101.859" dur="3.48">framework that&apos;s like really works for</text><text start="2103.78" dur="3.18">battery</text><text start="2105.339" dur="3.721">um I&apos;m curious you know I just have to</text><text start="2106.96" dur="4.92">ask this question because as listeners</text><text start="2109.06" dur="4.559">know I I founded get coin and uh while</text><text start="2111.88" dur="2.76">I&apos;m no longer involved in get coin I&apos;ve</text><text start="2113.619" dur="2.821">been following the work they&apos;ve been</text><text start="2114.64" dur="3.479">doing from the outside and they just</text><text start="2116.44" dur="3.3">launched Bitcoin passport which can</text><text start="2118.119" dur="4.861">basically Hoover up a bunch of different</text><text start="2119.74" dur="5.16">credentials on chain or off chain</text><text start="2122.98" dur="4.26">um and get coin passport is designed to</text><text start="2124.9" dur="4.199">solve civil resistance because get coin</text><text start="2127.24" dur="3.9">has a big civil resistance problem with</text><text start="2129.099" dur="4.02">Bitcoin grants being reliant on</text><text start="2131.14" dur="3.42">quadratic funding and so like I said you</text><text start="2133.119" dur="4.141">know this is all just a preamble to my</text><text start="2134.56" dur="4.5">question which is does kyc dial and kyc</text><text start="2137.26" dur="3.78">do anything from a civil resistance</text><text start="2139.06" dur="4.38">perspective do you think do you think it</text><text start="2141.04" dur="6.6">creates a utility for that</text><text start="2143.44" dur="6.419">yes I mean probably this is like the</text><text start="2147.64" dur="5.16">from from a pure severe resistance</text><text start="2149.859" dur="4.5">perspective like one of the more most</text><text start="2152.8" dur="3.48">heavy-handed</text><text start="2154.359" dur="4.201">um approach if you really only want to</text><text start="2156.28" dur="5.28">solve severe resistance but it also</text><text start="2158.56" dur="5.82">offers the ability that</text><text start="2161.56" dur="4.2">it&apos;s very hard to trick</text><text start="2164.38" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="2165.76" dur="5.64">because it has been like established the</text><text start="2168.16" dur="5.64">process is used by hundreds of millions</text><text start="2171.4" dur="4.5">of times like verification identity</text><text start="2173.8" dur="4.02">verification processes they are pretty</text><text start="2175.9" dur="3.719">fine-tuned</text><text start="2177.82" dur="4.259">um it creates a very strong civil</text><text start="2179.619" dur="4.381">resistance mechanism whether if you</text><text start="2182.079" dur="5.04">really just want to solve</text><text start="2184.0" dur="5.16">um would go with it it&apos;s really the</text><text start="2187.119" dur="3.96">question if it&apos;s if your use case is</text><text start="2189.16" dur="3.54">only severe resistance or it&apos;s CB</text><text start="2191.079" dur="5.28">resistance and you want to have in your</text><text start="2192.7" dur="5.52">illegal wrapper because then this also</text><text start="2196.359" dur="4.201">offers both at the same time because</text><text start="2198.22" dur="4.139">then you&apos;d know that no sanctioned</text><text start="2200.56" dur="4.559">person is at a</text><text start="2202.359" dur="4.921">um touching your treasury so you kind of</text><text start="2205.119" dur="4.141">actually comply and but you don&apos;t</text><text start="2207.28" dur="3.96">actually know who are your users so</text><text start="2209.26" dur="3.9">that&apos;s like one thing that like a lot of</text><text start="2211.24" dur="5.099">projects have been pretty excited about</text><text start="2213.16" dur="4.919">that through this framework and projects</text><text start="2216.339" dur="3.0">actually don&apos;t know who are their users</text><text start="2218.079" dur="3.601">they don&apos;t need to deal with personal</text><text start="2219.339" dur="4.5">information but they know to an</text><text start="2221.68" dur="5.82">extremely high degree that the user can</text><text start="2223.839" dur="4.561">be trusted and is and can be interacted</text><text start="2227.5" dur="3.48">with</text><text start="2228.4" dur="4.57">yeah I mean I think that makes sense</text><text start="2230.98" dur="3.74">um I think that there are probably</text><text start="2232.97" dur="4.67">[Music]</text><text start="2234.72" dur="4.54">non-kyc ways of doing civil resistance</text><text start="2237.64" dur="3.84">at least that&apos;s what I&apos;ve I&apos;ve learned</text><text start="2239.26" dur="4.5">over the last few episodes of green pill</text><text start="2241.48" dur="3.48">and doing research in this space and I&apos;m</text><text start="2243.76" dur="4.8">wondering to see if a more like</text><text start="2244.96" dur="7.2">skeuomorphic uh thing like like kyc Dao</text><text start="2248.56" dur="6.0">works or if like a more bright ID web of</text><text start="2252.16" dur="4.02">trust type of model is what captures the</text><text start="2254.56" dur="3.779">imagination of civil resistance in the</text><text start="2256.18" dur="3.899">space and get coins kind of prepared for</text><text start="2258.339" dur="3.24">anyone to be the winner of civil</text><text start="2260.079" dur="3.901">resistance because it can hoover up all</text><text start="2261.579" dur="4.321">these creds so uh we&apos;ll be curious to</text><text start="2263.98" dur="3.72">see if the Dow integrates kyc dial in</text><text start="2265.9" dur="3.84">the in the future if the by if the get</text><text start="2267.7" dur="3.419">coin dial integrates kysito in the</text><text start="2269.74" dur="4.379">future</text><text start="2271.119" dur="5.22">I mean so you know Bitcoin dial also</text><text start="2274.119" dur="4.141">gives out grants and as far as I know</text><text start="2276.339" dur="5.101">it&apos;s a U.S entity</text><text start="2278.26" dur="5.4">um so it&apos;s not we like like super</text><text start="2281.44" dur="4.02">resistance is not it&apos;s like a use case</text><text start="2283.66" dur="4.439">that covers because we do identity</text><text start="2285.46" dur="5.94">verification I wouldn&apos;t say that like we</text><text start="2288.099" dur="7.201">would be like a competitor uh for bright</text><text start="2291.4" dur="6.6">ID or or any of the other like or Zorro</text><text start="2295.3" dur="3.84">um in terms of like competing for severe</text><text start="2298.0" dur="4.2">resistance</text><text start="2299.14" dur="5.18">um I do agree that that type is needed</text><text start="2302.2" dur="6.78">um they are a lot less</text><text start="2304.32" dur="6.1">stringent on on data and so for sure I</text><text start="2308.98" dur="3.06">think that&apos;s awesome it&apos;s more about</text><text start="2310.42" dur="4.14">whether you have to meet some</text><text start="2312.04" dur="6.539">requirements then our tool also offers</text><text start="2314.56" dur="6.18">that by Nature so you might don&apos;t end up</text><text start="2318.579" dur="3.901">implementing two because you need to</text><text start="2320.74" dur="3.9">meet a higher requirement than just</text><text start="2322.48" dur="3.78">severe resistance kind of like this is</text><text start="2324.64" dur="2.219">how I&apos;m looking at it</text><text start="2326.26" dur="1.68">um</text><text start="2326.859" dur="4.081">yeah</text><text start="2327.94" dur="4.919">cool cool uh so Bitcoin it&apos;s been a lot</text><text start="2330.94" dur="4.139">of work to get there but actually uh</text><text start="2332.859" dur="3.781">transferred all of the assets get coin</text><text start="2335.079" dur="3.861">Holdings which is the company I&apos;m a part</text><text start="2336.64" dur="5.1">of transferred all of the assets to a a</text><text

there&apos;s been a lot of</text><text start="2345.82" dur="3.06">restructuring because we built the</text><text start="2347.2" dur="3.78">product wrong instead of the entity</text><text start="2348.88" dur="3.3">wrong at the start not realizing that</text><text start="2350.98" dur="5.34">the whole thing was going to become a</text><text start="2352.18" dur="5.64">dow but uh it I has no bearing on the</text><text start="2356.32" dur="3.24">point that you that you made right there</text><text start="2357.82" dur="3.9">I just wanted to while we&apos;re on the</text><text start="2359.56" dur="4.16">record here that say that the good coin</text><text start="2361.72" dur="4.619">is not in a US entity anymore yeah okay</text><text start="2363.72" dur="4.24">cool thanks thanks well I I think that&apos;s</text><text start="2366.339" dur="3.301">all the questions that I really had</text><text start="2367.96" dur="4.74">prepared I guess is there anything that</text><text start="2369.64" dur="6.78">I didn&apos;t ask that you want to say</text><text start="2372.7" dur="6.419">um I mean of course like you know when</text><text start="2376.42" dur="3.419">can you if you are interested</text><text start="2379.119" dur="2.821">um</text><text start="2379.839" dur="4.321">when can you learn more about kyc though</text><text start="2381.94" dur="4.62">so documentation is coming</text><text start="2384.16" dur="5.1">um if you head to our website</text><text start="2386.56" dur="4.279">um you can learn more you can join our</text><text

dur="3.72">described on the website we will be a</text><text start="2402.339" dur="3.061">lot more transparent about these it&apos;s</text><text start="2403.9" dur="3.84">just we need to do a couple of fine</text><text start="2405.4" dur="5.16">tuning of the product</text><text start="2407.74" dur="6.599">um as it&apos;s not just have to work it has</text><text start="2410.56" dur="5.58">to be

dur="5.76">exciting and we are here to talk and of</text><text start="2421.839" dur="3.841">course if you have questions and why</text><text start="2423.64" dur="5.1">compliance I&apos;m very happy to get into</text><text start="2425.68" dur="4.98">that with everyone</text><text start="2428.74" dur="4.44">I don&apos;t have anything</text><text start="2430.66" dur="4.64">um I super appreciate and it&apos;s been a</text><text start="2433.18" dur="6.0">pleasure to listen to the whole podcast</text><text start="2435.3" dur="6.4">like uh it&apos;s a good good experience to</text><text start="2439.18" dur="5.28">see like everyone&apos;s opinion in a right</text><text start="2441.7" dur="4.68">pretty concise format that like everyone</text><text start="2444.46" dur="4.02">talks a little bit about the same thing</text><text start="2446.38" dur="4.199">like same things but different things</text><text start="2448.48" dur="4.859">about but around the same topic</text><text start="2450.579" dur="4.621">I think it&apos;s super powerful because it</text><text start="2453.339" dur="4.681">gives a lot of people the ability to</text><text start="2455.2" dur="6.18">compare different approaches and really</text><text start="2458.02" dur="5.4">have a deeper understanding of like</text><text start="2461.38" dur="4.08">um what are what are what are was it</text><text start="2463.42" dur="4.32">what is identity because that&apos;s probably</text><text start="2465.46" dur="5.22">like the most complex question we</text><text start="2467.74" dur="6.06">we can talk about for years from today</text><text start="2470.68" dur="5.64">but also like these pieces of identity</text><text start="2473.8" dur="4.44">of severe resistance of verification of</text><text start="2476.32" dur="4.68">compliance</text><text start="2478.24" dur="4.08">um how it&apos;s stored yeah I think it gives</text><text start="2481.0" dur="3.72">a lot of people a lot better</text><text start="2482.32" dur="4.56">understanding so I super appreciate that</text><text start="2484.72" dur="4.74">totally yeah I mean part of the idea is</text><text start="2486.88" dur="4.26">that I just believe the identity is one</text><text start="2489.46" dur="3.659">of the key things for having a more</text><text start="2491.14" dur="4.5">regenerative crypto economic future and</text><text start="2493.119" dur="4.201">the reason for that is that you can see</text><text start="2495.64" dur="3.979">your counterparty and therefore you can</text><text start="2497.32" dur="4.38">have more positive some games repeat</text><text start="2499.619" dur="4.901">interactions and you can build trust</text><text start="2501.7" dur="4.44">over time and and it&apos;s so it&apos;s just kind</text><text start="2504.52" dur="3.24">of like Illuminating the identity space</text><text start="2506.14" dur="4.02">and hopefully that enables more Builders</text><text start="2507.76" dur="5.28">and more talent and more Capital to flow</text><text start="2510.16" dur="4.679">into regen projects so that&apos;s why we&apos;ve</text><text start="2513.04" dur="3.059">been doing it and what&apos;s nice is that</text><text start="2514.839" dur="4.921">everyone has a slightly different</text><text start="2516.099" dur="6.24">vantage point on on this space so trying</text><text start="2519.76" dur="3.599">to be very liberal in in daylighting a</text><text start="2522.339" dur="2.461">lot of people who are taking this</text><text start="2523.359" dur="4.801">problem seriously even if they have</text><text start="2524.8" dur="5.819">different values than each other and</text><text start="2528.16" dur="4.74">um and yeah I mean I hope I hope that in</text><text start="2530.619" dur="4.941">two years or three years when digital</text><text start="2532.9" dur="5.34">identity stuff is really prominent that</text><text start="2535.56" dur="5.5">uh that that we&apos;ve built a more</text><text start="2538.24" dur="4.44">regenerative web three so that that&apos;s</text><text start="2541.06" dur="3.12">sort of the vision but you know I&apos;m</text><text start="2542.68" dur="3.36">curious to play it forward for let&apos;s</text><text start="2544.18" dur="3.24">call it 3 to five years for you you know</text><text start="2546.04" dur="2.76">what do you think what do you think web3</text><text start="2547.42" dur="3.84">looks like in three to five years and</text><text start="2548.8" dur="5.52">how does identity play A Part I think</text><text start="2551.26" dur="5.4">well no like let&apos;s let&apos;s say I I hope or</text><text start="2554.32" dur="5.22">that what we are building towards is</text><text start="2556.66" dur="5.699">start hiding that tree</text><text start="2559.54" dur="4.86">um and and be able to make services that</text><text start="2562.359" dur="4.861">benefit from that trust and transparency</text><text start="2564.4" dur="5.58">that that tree brings but it just works</text><text start="2567.22" dur="6.96">for a number of use cases and not just</text><text start="2569.98" dur="7.68">crypto specific D5 uh staking but like</text><text start="2574.18" dur="5.34">really it really starts to get hidden</text><text start="2577.66" dur="4.56">away so maybe you know the whole concept</text><text start="2579.52" dur="4.799">of NFD Services really can be hidden</text><text start="2582.22" dur="4.139">because it&apos;s already covered by two</text><text start="2584.319" dur="3.861">other layers of services that just</text><text start="2586.359" dur="4.081">really use this as a fundamental layer</text><text start="2588.18" dur="4.54">and it&apos;s not the thing what we are</text><text start="2590.44" dur="5.46">building it&apos;s three more level three</text><text start="2592.72" dur="5.34">four layer up I hope we don&apos;t do a lot</text><text start="2595.9" dur="4.02">more L1 chains because we already have</text><text start="2598.06" dur="4.5">quite a few</text><text start="2599.92" dur="5.64">um so the the multi-chain word happened</text><text

just</text><text start="2617.56" dur="3.42">I I believe that we&apos;re gonna get to a</text><text start="2619.48" dur="4.379">point where you don&apos;t know you are using</text><text start="2620.98"

not I think</text><text start="2628.599" dur="5.341">it&apos;s debatable and if this brought in a</text><text start="2631.42" dur="4.5">category of Concepts that really opened</text><text start="2633.94" dur="4.74">the space from</text><text start="2635.92" dur="4.74">my developers to really understand just</text><text start="2638.68" dur="4.2">numbers to like people who like building</text><text start="2640.66" dur="4.8">communities in a very very different way</text><text start="2642.88" dur="4.199">I think we can see we hopefully we will</text><text start="2645.46" dur="4.44">see a lot more of these kind of like</text><text start="2647.079" dur="4.981">blooming of a concept that becomes like</text><text start="2649.9" dur="5.219">a rich ecosystem</text><text start="2652.06" dur="4.62">um and I do believe that like we will</text><text start="2655.119" dur="3.96">have mechanisms to better deal with</text><text start="2656.68" dur="4.86">scams that&apos;s something that really</text><text start="2659.079" dur="4.801">tarnishing the the reputation of that</text><text start="2661.54" dur="4.68">tree to a degree that some people are</text><text start="2663.88" dur="4.56">like very afraid but if it&apos;s hidden</text><text start="2666.22" dur="5.16">we can actually probably even get them</text><text start="2668.44" dur="6.54">on board because they just started using</text><text start="2671.38" dur="6.12">a service you know like the whole run to</text><text start="2674.98" dur="6.359">earn Staten and and sweatcoin and those</text><text start="2677.5" dur="5.76">things do they really use crypto yes but</text><text start="2681.339" dur="3.841">they are actually incentivizing people</text><text start="2683.26" dur="3.54">to do Sports which is a super</text><text start="2685.18" dur="3.36">interesting thing and it seems to be</text><text start="2686.8" dur="5.16">working by the numbers</text><text start="2688.54" dur="5.34">yeah that&apos;s interesting what are the</text><text start="2691.96" dur="3.48">numbers there how much does sweatcoin</text><text start="2693.88" dur="6.199">have adoption</text><text start="2695.44" dur="4.639">I mean it&apos;s I I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="2702.119" dur="6.941">started in like 2014 and they have like</text><text start="2705.4" dur="5.28">75 million users oh wow I&apos;m way off the</text><text start="2709.06" dur="3.42">main path of asking you about identity</text><text start="2710.68" dur="4.56">in kyc but I was just curious default</text><text start="2712.48" dur="4.619">not it&apos;s that&apos;s so so you know like and</text><text start="2715.24" dur="4.98">these are the crazy things when like and</text><text start="2717.099" dur="7.26">also like Nike did like 190 million like</text><text start="2720.22" dur="7.56">uh income or revenue on nft sales like</text><text start="2724.359" dur="5.941">probably 10 10 people 15 people worked</text><text start="2727.78" dur="4.68">in it and generated more money than a</text><text start="2730.3" dur="3.779">lot of their departments you should get</text><text start="2732.46" dur="3.119">out get out of the shoe business and get</text><text start="2734.079" dur="3.121">into the nft business if they&apos;re gonna</text><text start="2735.579" dur="4.5">exactly like let&apos;s just let&apos;s just keep</text><text start="2737.2" dur="5.899">selling these nice little uh shoes for</text><text start="2740.079" dur="3.02">apes and then</text><text start="2749.44" dur="2.82">um anyway sorry I didn&apos;t mean to</text><text start="2751.06" dur="4.14">interrupt you go ahead</text><text start="2752.26" dur="5.16">no like so like you know we are already</text><text start="2755.2" dur="4.8">seeing these things happening</text><text start="2757.42" dur="4.14">um like digital received as nfds that</text><text start="2760.0" dur="5.16">can be like you know engaged Community</text><text start="2761.56" dur="5.4">it&apos;s a lot less about pfv 10 000 this</text><text start="2765.16" dur="3.78">like crazy close community of like</text><text start="2766.96" dur="3.72">almost like gentleman clubs and a lot</text><text start="2768.94" dur="3.24">more like if you brought the shoe you</text><text start="2770.68" dur="3.12">got this nft you have access to a</text><text start="2772.18" dur="3.659">Discord if you are active you might get</text><text start="2773.8" dur="3.6">additional benefits it&apos;s a little bit</text><text start="2775.839" dur="3.541">marketing but like kind of turning</text><text start="2777.4" dur="3.719">around and maybe actually creating a</text><text start="2779.38" dur="3.959">community outside shared interest</text><text start="2781.119" dur="4.74">because you&apos;re willing to engage and not</text><text start="2783.339" dur="4.621">just call the nfdm never cared about to</text><text start="2785.859" dur="4.561">claim it or something</text><text start="2787.96" dur="4.2">um you know co-ops and and Ticketmaster</text><text start="2790.42" dur="3.12">I think just announced recently that</text><text start="2792.16" dur="2.64">like they&apos;re gonna be doing like one</text><text start="2793.54" dur="2.579">chain ticketing with one of the</text><text start="2794.8" dur="3.0">blockchains</text><text start="2796.119" dur="3.48">um to some degree of course but like</text><text start="2797.8" dur="4.26">these things are happening and these</text><text start="2799.599" dur="5.101">things are like adoption to to like a</text><text start="2802.06" dur="4.98">very interesting angle</text><text start="2804.7" dur="4.2">um solanape is having conversations with</text><text start="2807.04" dur="5.039">like POS terminals like you know like</text><text start="2808.9" dur="5.4">like it is slowly happening</text><text start="2812.079" dur="4.621">um the question is are we going to see</text><text start="2814.3" dur="3.96">the Breakthrough when it just you know</text><text start="2816.7" dur="3.96">you just got a ticket</text><text start="2818.26" dur="3.9">but you can put it into a wallet and you</text><text start="2820.66" dur="3.6">can really own it and you can go to a</text><text start="2822.16" dur="4.439">secondary Market where there is like a</text><text start="2824.26" dur="4.62">transparent Marketplace</text><text start="2826.599" dur="4.02">um you know like those these are small</text><text start="2828.88" dur="3.78">things of course but like they really</text><text start="2830.619" dur="4.321">create the value at the end</text><text start="2832.66" dur="4.38">and we are getting there that is</text><text start="2834.94" dur="5.58">like big projects that we&apos;ll bring on</text><text start="2837.04" dur="5.7">not 10 000 more New Year users but like</text><text start="2840.52" dur="5.46">in the hundreds of millions potentially</text><text start="2842.74" dur="5.04">that just don&apos;t really understand that</text><text start="2845.98" dur="3.599">um there is crypto of course there is a</text><text start="2847.78" dur="4.14">wallet Key Management question that&apos;s</text><text start="2849.579" dur="3.901">going to be huge I think there is there</text><text start="2851.92" dur="5.22">is a lot of interesting projects working</text><text start="2853.48" dur="5.76">on on on hiding keys or creating these</text><text start="2857.14" dur="4.38">Library centralized uh Key Management</text><text start="2859.24" dur="3.78">Frameworks that also gonna help a lot</text><text start="2861.52" dur="4.2">when</text><text start="2863.02" dur="6.36">security is there but the key is really</text><text start="2865.72" dur="6.18">hidden from the user so the monotonic</text><text start="2869.38" dur="4.62">like storage is like not really needed</text><text start="2871.9" dur="3.719">because I just onboarded a bunch of</text><text start="2874.0" dur="3.359">people to metamask and trust me like</text><text start="2875.619" dur="3.781">that&apos;s one of the most painful paintings</text><text start="2877.359" dur="4.98">like but you said I shouldn&apos;t store this</text><text start="2879.4" dur="4.14">key in a in a text format or I shouldn&apos;t</text><text start="2882.339" dur="3.901">write it down but I should remember</text><text start="2883.54" dur="4.74">these words how do I do that</text><text start="2886.24" dur="4.44">um it&apos;s it&apos;s a lot harder to get them</text><text start="2888.28" dur="4.74">past that phase than getting them to a</text><text start="2890.68" dur="4.08">D5 transaction</text><text start="2893.02" dur="3.48">um I saw a couple of followers that does</text><text start="2894.76" dur="4.62">it amazingly</text><text start="2896.5" dur="3.96">um kind of shout out to Phantom I think</text><text start="2899.38" dur="3.6">they have like one of the best</text><text start="2900.46" dur="4.32">onboarding flows where you only need to</text><text start="2902.98" dur="3.42">store private key when you&apos;re wallet</text><text start="2904.78" dur="4.98">interacted with a transaction because</text><text start="2906.4" dur="4.439">before that it didn&apos;t have like value on</text><text start="2909.76" dur="2.28">it</text><text start="2910.839" dur="3.541">um but you had a whole lot number</text><text start="2912.04" dur="4.5">immediately when you opened the wallet</text><text start="2914.38" dur="5.459">and it&apos;s like from a user perspective</text><text start="2916.54" dur="5.46">who is like brand new to crypto is</text><text start="2919.839" dur="4.5">is so much better because you have then</text><text start="2922.0" dur="4.92">later an incentive to secure well your</text><text start="2924.339" dur="4.621">wallet not a barrier to enter to see</text><text start="2926.92" dur="4.439">your wallet and you know like these</text><text start="2928.96" dur="5.159">small things like ux we probably all</text><text start="2931.359" dur="6.301">agreed at like crypto ux is problematic</text><text start="2934.119" dur="6.301">at best but it&apos;s getting a lot better</text><text start="2937.66" dur="4.98">and some of it is ux
