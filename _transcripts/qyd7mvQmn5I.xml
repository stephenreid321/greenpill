a</text><text start="245.76" dur="4.44">tweet a little bit earlier today in</text><text start="247.86" dur="3.959">which we were talking about uh different</text><text start="250.2" dur="3.66">mechanisms for Collective resource</text><text start="251.819" dur="3.601">allocation and basically the idea here</text><text start="253.86" dur="3.36">is that if we want to fund the commons</text><text start="255.42" dur="3.12">if we want to fund our Collective goods</text><text start="257.22" dur="3.66">and we have to figure out how to measure</text><text start="258.54" dur="3.599">what Collective Goods we care about and</text><text start="260.88" dur="3.24">in web 3 we can create more</text><text start="262.139" dur="4.62">decentralized coordination mechanisms</text><text start="264.12" dur="4.5">that fund the commons and uh you&apos;re</text><text start="266.759" dur="3.901">you&apos;re the ultimate person to have on</text><text start="268.62" dur="4.68">for this episode because of your work at</text><text start="270.66" dur="4.2">giveth and token engineering Commons so</text><text start="273.3" dur="4.56">uh as a primer can you tell us about</text><text start="274.86" dur="5.16">that before we jump in yeah I mean uh</text><text start="277.86" dur="3.54">the goal of the common stack and token</text><text start="280.02" dur="3.239">engineering comments and really giveth</text><text start="281.4" dur="4.14">and everything that we&apos;re working on is</text><text start="283.259" dur="4.561">to create markets which we&apos;ll talk about</text><text start="285.54" dur="5.7">later around public goods so that</text><text start="287.82" dur="5.64">because we know that like the you know</text><text start="291.24" dur="4.2">the collective is allocating resources</text><text start="293.46" dur="4.62">to things that will create value for the</text><text start="295.44" dur="4.44">collective but the problem is while the</text><text start="298.08" dur="4.8">collective doesn&apos;t have any customers so</text><text start="299.88" dur="5.52">business models won&apos;t work but I am</text><text start="302.88" dur="5.64">firmly in I firmly believe that we can</text><text start="305.4" dur="5.4">use markets that we can use economic</text><text start="308.52" dur="5.76">systems with supply and demand to</text><text start="310.8" dur="5.399">actually value that value creation and</text><text start="314.28" dur="3.479">reward the value creation so that&apos;s</text><text start="316.199" dur="3.0">that&apos;s what I&apos;m pushing for token</text><text start="317.759" dur="3.181">engineering Commons was the first one</text><text start="319.199" dur="4.921">and we used some interesting mechanisms</text><text start="320.94" dur="6.12">to design that system and I&apos;m excited to</text><text start="324.12" dur="4.68">dive into more of them yeah so yeah the</text><text start="327.06" dur="3.6">thesis is better collective intelligence</text><text start="328.8" dur="4.739">but equals better Collective resource</text><text start="330.66" dur="3.96">allocation this is going to be a medley</text><text start="333.539" dur="2.761">episode in which we&apos;re going to go</text><text start="334.62" dur="3.48">through a bunch of existing mechanisms</text><text start="336.3" dur="3.48">for collective intelligence and</text><text start="338.1" dur="3.72">Collective resource allocation we&apos;re</text><text start="339.78" dur="3.9">going to go into some web era mechanisms</text><text start="341.82" dur="4.14">and we&apos;re going to get into some up and</text><text start="343.68" dur="3.6">coming web error mechanisms and what are</text><text start="345.96" dur="3.72">the questions we want to ask for each</text><text start="347.28" dur="3.72">mechanism uh what is it and where does</text><text start="349.68" dur="3.299">it work well and where does it not work</text><text start="351.0" dur="3.24">well feels like a pretty good question</text><text start="352.979" dur="2.341">to ask any to them anything else you</text><text start="354.24" dur="2.76">would add there</text><text start="355.32" dur="2.58">yeah I think that&apos;s I think that&apos;s where</text><text start="357.0" dur="3.12">we start</text><text start="357.9" dur="4.139">okay you want to tee us off with an</text><text start="360.12" dur="3.84">existing mechanism for Collective</text><text start="362.039" dur="3.421">resource allocation sure I thought this</text><text start="363.96" dur="3.06">is great and Iran actually shout out to</text><text start="365.46" dur="4.14">neuron who threw this one in your</text><text start="367.02" dur="5.22">Twitter thread tithing tithing is the OG</text><text start="369.6" dur="6.06">resource allocation right tithing is the</text><text start="372.24" dur="4.98">idea of hey everyone donate 10 of your</text><text start="375.66" dur="4.92">wealth or some percentage of your wealth</text><text start="377.22" dur="5.64">to the church or at least to non-profits</text><text start="380.58" dur="4.619">in some way uh so that we can support</text><text start="382.86" dur="4.619">public goods and it&apos;s it&apos;s really simple</text><text start="385.199" dur="4.981">the the great thing is that it&apos;s really</text><text start="387.479" dur="3.361">simple uh what it&apos;s good at uh is you</text><text start="390.18" dur="2.16">know</text><text start="390.84" dur="3.18">um especially if it&apos;s paired with</text><text start="392.34" dur="3.96">religion or some kind of belief</text><text start="394.02" dur="4.5">structure it&apos;s really it&apos;s just really</text><text start="396.3" dur="4.739">simple to execute oh I made this much</text><text start="398.52" dur="4.26">money give 10 to the church what it&apos;s</text><text start="401.039" dur="3.78">bad at well there&apos;s no feedback</text><text start="402.78" dur="3.78">mechanisms uh it&apos;s there&apos;s no</text><text start="404.819" dur="3.961">enforcement really you know it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="406.56" dur="5.1">a donation so you don&apos;t end up</text><text start="408.78" dur="5.34">necessarily you have to really maintain</text><text start="411.66" dur="4.56">a strong culture to make it work</text><text start="414.12" dur="4.74">it feels like that&apos;s an a way of</text><text start="416.22" dur="4.14">allocating getting funding and you know</text><text start="418.86" dur="3.059">the fact that I think it&apos;s connected to</text><text start="420.36" dur="3.42">a religious body makes people feel</text><text start="421.919" dur="3.421">compelled to give the money but it feels</text><text start="423.78" dur="3.18">like there&apos;s no real checks and balances</text><text start="425.34" dur="3.6">to make sure that the church or whatever</text><text start="426.96" dur="4.019">group is administering the funds is</text><text start="428.94" dur="5.28">actually giving it to the right groups</text><text start="430.979" dur="5.16">other than maybe the Optics of people</text><text start="434.22" dur="4.14">seeing the capital deployed at a very</text><text start="436.139" dur="4.141">surface level and they&apos;re happy with it</text><text start="438.36" dur="3.779">or or they&apos;re not are there any other</text><text start="440.28" dur="3.24">places where this works well or doesn&apos;t</text><text start="442.139" dur="3.301">work well</text><text start="443.52" dur="4.2">you know I mean I think it&apos;s basically</text><text start="445.44" dur="5.46">donations right so it works well where</text><text start="447.72" dur="4.919">donations work well which is ah you know</text><text start="450.9" dur="3.66">when you see a need that really hits</text><text start="452.639" dur="3.96">your hits your emotions you can just</text><text start="454.56" dur="4.02">instantly give to it and especially with</text><text start="456.599" dur="4.32">tithing you kind of have an excuse to</text><text start="458.58" dur="4.38">give to it so I think it would work well</text><text start="460.919" dur="6.18">especially for local programs on the</text><text start="462.96" dur="6.239">ground smaller projects uh but in Mass I</text><text start="467.099" dur="4.5">don&apos;t see it as a successful strategy</text><text start="469.199" dur="4.681">we&apos;re in all right are there any other</text><text start="471.599" dur="4.201">existing mechanisms that we want to that</text><text start="473.88" dur="4.2">we want to talk about well obviously</text><text start="475.8" dur="4.08">taxes is like the main one this is what</text><text start="478.08" dur="4.32">funds public goods right now this is how</text><text start="479.88" dur="6.48">Collective resources are are allocated</text><text start="482.4" dur="6.06">right now so uh there there&apos;s no</text><text start="486.36" dur="4.679">um yeah we have to talk about it and and</text><text start="488.46" dur="4.38">this is like force tithing with like a</text><text start="491.039" dur="3.66">little bit more complication you know</text><text start="492.84" dur="4.079">but it&apos;s almost the same thing except</text><text start="494.699" dur="3.9">instead of to a church or uh you&apos;re</text><text start="496.919" dur="2.701">basically giving it to the other Church</text><text start="498.599" dur="3.061">government</text><text start="499.62" dur="4.859">yeah I&apos;m gonna Channel my inner Eric</text><text start="501.66" dur="5.159">Voorhees here and say uh I did not</text><text start="504.479" dur="6.241">consent to this Taxation and Taxation is</text><text start="506.819" dur="5.34">threat uh Eric taxation is theft uh and</text><text start="510.72" dur="2.999">Eric uh we of course that love Eric</text><text start="512.159" dur="3.421">because he&apos;s an OG in the crypto space</text><text start="513.719" dur="3.24">and uh he represents the libertarian</text><text start="515.58" dur="2.459">argument really well</text><text start="516.959" dur="2.281">um I think that there&apos;s really an</text><text start="518.039" dur="3.601">interesting back and forth between the</text><text start="519.24" dur="4.62">argument that taxation is theft</text><text start="521.64" dur="3.66">um and this argument that that that&apos;s</text><text start="523.86" dur="3.24">the a priority argument I did not</text><text start="525.3" dur="4.2">consent to this and therefore it is</text><text start="527.1" dur="3.84">theft but the consequentialist argument</text><text start="529.5" dur="3.899">that I always see coming from like</text><text start="530.94" dur="4.44">leftists is well when you give 20 to</text><text start="533.399" dur="3.961">have a thousand X Better World</text><text start="535.38" dur="3.12">um you know without that 20 we wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="537.36" dur="3.72">have the internet because we wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="538.5" dur="5.04">have DARPA we wouldn&apos;t have</text><text start="541.08" dur="5.46">um we we wouldn&apos;t have the resource like</text><text start="543.54" dur="5.82">our uh flight controllers and Regulation</text><text start="546.54" dur="3.78">and and roads and bridges and there&apos;s</text><text start="549.36" dur="2.7">probably a bunch of stuff that we just</text><text start="550.32" dur="3.959">take for granted here like I think the</text><text start="552.06" dur="4.08">counter yeah we would have war and so</text><text start="554.279" dur="3.781">the counter argument is like what it</text><text start="556.14" dur="3.12">what it like I want to fund the part of</text><text start="558.06" dur="3.24">the government that I care about the</text><text start="559.26" dur="3.84">comments that I care about but I don&apos;t</text><text start="561.3" dur="3.3">want like I want the part that funds</text><text start="563.1" dur="3.06">that funds the pothole being fixed</text><text start="564.6"

start="569.82" dur="4.44">yeah exactly I I mean the the real the</text><text start="572.94" dur="3.48">real challenge of course is that power</text><text start="574.26" dur="4.74">corrupts and in the

you know and that</text><text start="587.339" dur="4.56">happens what every two four years to</text><text start="590.1" dur="2.88">sometimes six years a different</text><text start="591.899" dur="3.541">different governments have different</text><text start="592.98" dur="5.4">strategies so it&apos;s yeah</text><text start="595.44" dur="4.8">it&apos;s slow and I don&apos;t it&apos;s the best</text><text start="598.38" dur="4.5">Honestly though it&apos;s the best we have</text><text start="600.24" dur="5.64">like uh that exists right now it is</text><text start="602.88" dur="5.519">doing yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s doing the most it&apos;s</text><text start="605.88" dur="3.78">creating the most value collectively if</text><text start="608.399" dur="2.221">it was the best we have then I think</text><text start="609.66" dur="2.64">that would be a pretty short episode</text><text start="610.62" dur="3.779">we&apos;d be like all right taxes are the way</text><text start="612.3" dur="3.84">let&apos;s call it yeah but uh we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="614.399" dur="3.961">get into some novel mechanisms that</text><text start="616.14" dur="3.72">solve some of the problems with taxes uh</text><text start="618.36" dur="3.96">and you know I think taxes are the</text><text start="619.86" dur="5.099">funding uh resource collection mechanism</text><text start="622.32" dur="4.44">but the allocation mechanism is voting</text><text start="624.959" dur="4.32">so let&apos;s talk about voting next and</text><text start="626.76" dur="4.019">there&apos;s many different types of voting</text><text start="629.279" dur="3.0">um the one that I&apos;m thinking of as we&apos;re</text><text start="630.779" dur="4.021">talking about allocating tax dollars is</text><text start="632.279" dur="3.961">driven by majority rule and you&apos;ve got</text><text start="634.8" dur="3.18">this kind of two-party system where</text><text start="636.24" dur="4.62">people are elected in a representative</text><text start="637.98" dur="5.22">democracy there&apos;s certain issues that</text><text start="640.86" dur="4.2">get kicked out to the actual citizens on</text><text start="643.2" dur="3.18">a ballot box but for at least the most</text><text start="645.06" dur="2.88">part in the United States where I live</text><text start="646.38" dur="3.6">we&apos;ve got a representative democracy</text><text start="647.94" dur="4.26">where you elect a representative and</text><text start="649.98" dur="3.419">then they via voting and then there&apos;s a</text><text start="652.2" dur="3.06">second layer of voting where they&apos;ve</text><text start="653.399" dur="4.021">they are in hopefully informed one would</text><text start="655.26" dur="3.66">hope and then they vote on where those</text><text start="657.42" dur="3.84">out resources are allocated but you have</text><text start="658.92" dur="3.72">sort of a capture problem where money to</text><text start="661.26" dur="4.38">interest can go in and they can kind of</text><text start="662.64" dur="4.939">capture uh the representatives so</text><text start="665.64" dur="3.54">there&apos;s majority rule voting there&apos;s</text><text start="667.579" dur="2.741">consensus-based voting which is</text><text start="669.18" dur="2.64">basically we have to get absolute</text><text start="670.32" dur="3.42">consensus everyone has to agree on</text><text start="671.82" dur="3.66">something to move forward and there&apos;s a</text><text start="673.74" dur="4.56">bunch of different subtypes of voting</text><text start="675.48" dur="4.2">and I think it&apos;s clear to me that this</text><text start="678.3" dur="2.88">pit is kind of in the traditional World</text><text start="679.68" dur="3.18">paired with taxes as a way that</text><text start="681.18" dur="3.54">resources are allocated</text><text start="682.86" dur="5.159">yeah it&apos;s like this is the feedback</text><text start="684.72" dur="5.34">mechanism for taxes and it&apos;s I don&apos;t</text><text start="688.019" dur="3.841">know I think it&apos;s kind of pathetic uh at</text><text start="690.06" dur="3.6">least the way we do voting now you know</text><text start="691.86" dur="3.659">at its core voting should be signal</text><text start="693.66" dur="3.84">aggregation it shouldn&apos;t be and it</text><text start="695.519" dur="3.901">should have way better ux but that&apos;s not</text><text start="697.5" dur="3.66">happening anytime soon I mean we&apos;re</text><text start="699.42" dur="4.2">using the same voting mechanisms that we</text><text start="701.16" dur="4.679">used before there was Cars before there</text><text start="703.62" dur="4.02">were trains you know like people were</text><text start="705.839" dur="4.201">riding horses around and this is how</text><text start="707.64" dur="4.139">they voted and somehow that&apos;s lingered</text><text start="710.04" dur="3.359">well there&apos;s like I think a kind of like</text><text start="711.779" dur="2.641">Lindy effect to these things where you</text><text start="713.399" dur="2.701">know the same reason people talk about</text><text start="714.42" dur="3.419">Bitcoin has been around for a long time</text><text start="716.1" dur="3.54">and therefore it will continue to be</text><text start="717.839" dur="3.721">around for a long time and I think that</text><text start="719.64" dur="3.36">you know the counter argument to well</text><text start="721.56" dur="3.24">it&apos;s it&apos;s old so we shouldn&apos;t use it is</text><text start="723.0" dur="3.0">well it&apos;s old so it is trusted so we</text><text start="724.8" dur="3.599">should use it</text><text start="726.0" dur="5.459">um and and so there&apos;s a Lindy effect I</text><text start="728.399" dur="4.921">think to voting in in that uh what&apos;s the</text><text start="731.459" dur="5.221">whole thing about democracy is it&apos;s the</text><text start="733.32" dur="5.34">it&apos;s it&apos;s the best uh it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s the</text><text start="736.68" dur="3.48">best mechanism that we have like better</text><text start="738.66" dur="3.54">than all the all the other ones I think</text><text start="740.16" dur="3.359">I&apos;m butchering that quote here yeah but</text><text start="742.2" dur="3.06">uh I I definitely know what you&apos;re</text><text start="743.519" dur="6.06">saying it&apos;s like the best of the worst</text><text start="745.26" dur="5.88">options you know uh but I I hope that I</text><text start="749.579" dur="3.721">mean I feel like at least this is what</text><text start="751.14" dur="2.939">I&apos;m in web 3 to do we can build a better</text><text start="753.3" dur="2.76">way</text><text start="754.079" dur="3.541">yeah well this is here this is the</text><text start="756.06" dur="2.7">Winston Churchill quote democracy is the</text><text start="757.62" dur="3.54">worst form of government except for all</text><text start="758.76" dur="4.259">the others that have been tried well</text><text start="761.16" dur="5.82">let&apos;s try more [ __ ] Winston that&apos;s what</text><text start="763.019" dur="5.701">we&apos;re here exactly all right uh markets</text><text start="766.98" dur="3.359">should we talk about markets next yeah</text><text start="768.72" dur="4.14">of course yeah I mean it&apos;s a whole</text><text start="770.339" dur="4.861">category of things but uh go ahead yeah</text><text start="772.86" dur="5.099">well markets are are incredible I feel</text><text start="775.2" dur="4.92">like markets have done the best for uh</text><text start="777.959" dur="4.021">into for resource allocation in general</text><text start="780.12" dur="3.6">but they&apos;re not great at Collective</text><text start="781.98" dur="3.299">resource allocation they kind of you</text><text start="783.72" dur="3.54">know it&apos;s the the money game controls</text><text start="785.279" dur="4.401">markets and you you&apos;re really always</text><text start="787.26" dur="5.819">providing for customers markets require</text><text start="789.68" dur="5.26">customers in general uh like at least if</text><text start="793.079" dur="5.401">you&apos;re using profit as a shelling point</text><text start="794.94" dur="5.519">then you need to have Revenue costs and</text><text start="798.48" dur="4.14">and so you know in the end you can use</text><text start="800.459" dur="4.261">kind of Excel spreadsheets to say hey</text><text start="802.62" dur="4.74">I&apos;ll make money if I if I participate</text><text start="804.72" dur="4.679">with this project and then everyone is</text><text start="807.36" dur="3.9">using a similar spreadsheet to say hey</text><text start="809.399" dur="4.68">we&apos;re all making money so coordination</text><text start="811.26" dur="5.879">is effortless but then there&apos;s the</text><text start="814.079" dur="4.801">classic you know market failures uh you</text><text start="817.139" dur="3.241">know public goods don&apos;t get funding very</text><text start="818.88" dur="4.5">well through markets information</text><text start="820.38" dur="4.92">asymmetry Monopoly there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="823.38" dur="4.019">issues with markets but they work really</text><text start="825.3" dur="4.02">well if you&apos;re just trying to get a cell</text><text start="827.399" dur="4.321">phone you know</text><text start="829.32" dur="4.319">yeah so uh for private Goods markets are</text><text start="831.72" dur="3.119">really good at Capital allocation and</text><text start="833.639" dur="2.281">basically the idea here is that you&apos;ve</text><text start="834.839" dur="4.261">got a distributed collective</text><text start="835.92" dur="4.68">intelligence mechanism in which like say</text><text start="839.1" dur="3.06">I wanna I&apos;m just gonna use your example</text><text start="840.6" dur="3.299">of a phone</text><text start="842.16" dur="5.28">um then if there&apos;s enough aggregate</text><text start="843.899" dur="5.401">demand for a phone then that will uh</text><text start="847.44" dur="5.339">relative to the supply raise the price</text><text start="849.3" dur="5.94">of phones in the market and therefore</text><text start="852.779" dur="4.56">more suppliers will come online because</text><text start="855.24" dur="4.02">of the incentive The increased margins</text><text start="857.339" dur="4.56">to develop phones and this is a</text><text start="859.26" dur="6.0">distributed on the system on the agent</text><text start="861.899" dur="5.461">based level this is what what allows me</text><text start="865.26" dur="4.379">to purchase uh an item that I want but</text><text start="867.36" dur="4.14">on the systemic level there&apos;s kind of a</text><text start="869.639" dur="3.721">balancing act between supply and demand</text><text start="871.5" dur="3.36">and a collective intelligence mechanism</text><text start="873.36" dur="3.539">that tells the market what to build and</text><text start="874.86" dur="4.68">what to fund uh as long as there&apos;s a</text><text start="876.899" dur="4.68">revenue model for producing an item then</text><text start="879.54" dur="4.26">it&apos;ll be produced and I remember there&apos;s</text><text start="881.579" dur="6.0">a story about uh after the fall of the</text><text start="883.8" dur="6.479">USSR the uh one one of the leaders of of</text><text start="887.579" dur="4.2">the USSR coming over to to the United</text><text start="890.279" dur="3.481">States and going into a grocery store</text><text start="891.779" dur="5.221">and just being so impressed by the</text><text start="893.76" dur="5.699">variety and the diversity of goods that</text><text start="897.0" dur="4.98">were available in the United States with</text><text start="899.459" dur="4.141">the market-based capitalist uh based</text><text start="901.98" dur="3.659">economy so it creates anything that</text><text start="903.6" dur="3.84">there&apos;s consumer demand for backed by</text><text start="905.639" dur="4.861">buying pressure it&apos;s able to produce</text><text start="907.44" dur="4.86">those goods yeah and and and it enables</text><text start="910.5" dur="4.199">Innovation right it really because</text><text start="912.3" dur="4.26">people can be like I I think there will</text><text start="914.699" dur="3.421">be demand for this and if they can</text><text start="916.56" dur="3.719">convince an investor that there will be</text><text start="918.12" dur="4.38">demand for it they can try to create a</text><text start="920.279" dur="4.141">product that no one&apos;s asking for like</text><text start="922.5" dur="4.8">this Smartphone no one asked for a</text><text start="924.42" dur="4.979">smartphone right and but people thought</text><text start="927.3" dur="3.42">someone uh you know the the crew that</text><text start="929.399" dur="3.721">made the smartphones actually it&apos;s</text><text start="930.72" dur="4.32">General magic back in the day in the 90s</text><text start="933.12" dur="4.8">were making these things and no one</text><text start="935.04" dur="4.38">wanted them they failed uh but the</text><text start="937.92" dur="3.779">people who started that project actually</text><text start="939.42" dur="5.099">ended up eventually the market wanted it</text><text start="941.699" dur="4.2">and they produced it yeah well you know</text><text start="944.519" dur="4.62">and there&apos;s sort of like the capitalist</text><text start="945.899" dur="4.44">Gambit where uh where basically if you</text><text start="949.139" dur="2.94">ask people what they would have want</text><text start="950.339" dur="3.721">wanted then they would have set a faster</text><text start="952.079" dur="3.781">horse that&apos;s a Henry Ford quote who of</text><text start="954.06" dur="3.54">course invented the Model

dur="6.0">capitalist evolutionary market-based X</text><text start="963.12" dur="5.7">prize uh at the that encourages</text><text start="966.3" dur="3.719">Innovation and um you know one of the</text><text start="968.82" dur="3.72">things that kind of is at the tip of my</text><text start="970.019" dur="5.161">tongue as we move into novel mechanisms</text><text start="972.54" dur="6.299">is what if we could get the public goods</text><text start="975.18" dur="5.099">funding that comes from uh the uh the</text><text start="978.839" dur="3.36">scale of public goods funding that comes</text><text start="980.279" dur="4.021">from something like taxes but with the</text><text start="982.199" dur="4.681">accountability that comes from something</text><text start="984.3" dur="5.219">like markets so a feedback loop around</text><text start="986.88" dur="4.74">funding of public goods that to me feels</text><text start="989.519" dur="4.62">like the the Holy Grail when I look at</text><text start="991.62" dur="4.98">uh these existing mechanisms that we&apos;ve</text><text start="994.139" dur="4.2">gone through absolutely and and the</text><text start="996.6" dur="4.979">coolest thing about markets is that it&apos;s</text><text start="998.339" dur="6.0">win-win nobody is losing tithing taxes</text><text start="1001.579" dur="5.221">and voting mean you know these are like</text><text start="1004.339" dur="5.161">there&apos;s losers in that game so if you</text><text start="1006.8" dur="6.0">vote Yes or in that and but the nose win</text><text start="1009.5" dur="4.86">you lose right taxes taxpayers pay and</text><text start="1012.8" dur="3.959">you know and then the people who don&apos;t</text><text start="1014.36" dur="5.52">pay taxes they all they all get the same</text><text start="1016.759" dur="4.981">benefits so uh but markets there are no</text><text start="1019.88" dur="4.439">losers you know uh I mean in the money</text><text start="1021.74" dur="4.98">game there&apos;s losers but with markets if</text><text start="1024.319" dur="5.041">you&apos;re creating value you win which is</text><text start="1026.72" dur="4.739">amazing yeah I mean I think that one uh</text><text start="1029.36" dur="5.459">criticism sub Market that I&apos;ll add is a</text><text start="1031.459" dur="8.041">Counterpoint is this idea that if I am</text><text start="1034.819" dur="7.14">at doing my fiduciary duty uh as the</text><text start="1039.5" dur="4.98">shareholder uh or a management team of</text><text start="1041.959" dur="4.081">let&apos;s call it a widget Factory uh I&apos;m</text><text start="1044.48" dur="3.479">trying to produce as many widgets as as</text><text

I think that that&apos;s</text><text start="1072.44" dur="4.5">another valid criticism of of</text><text start="1074.48" dur="4.8">market-based mechanisms and and and the</text><text start="1076.94" dur="4.979">real problem is that the the commons</text><text start="1079.28" dur="4.68">doesn&apos;t have a market to push back right</text><text start="1081.919" dur="4.5">it&apos;s like there&apos;s a market for producing</text><text start="1083.96" dur="4.56">those widgets but like you said there&apos;s</text><text start="1086.419" dur="4.081">maybe the widget Factory owners have a</text><text

dur="3.48">shareholders could actually sue them but</text><text start="1100.039" dur="4.26">it&apos;s because there&apos;s no market for a</text><text start="1101.48" dur="4.38">clean River if if if

on</text><text start="1146.12" dur="2.7">the category of web-based mechanisms</text><text start="1147.679" dur="2.701">before we dive into the specific</text><text start="1148.82" dur="4.2">mechanisms and I&apos;ll say that what I&apos;m</text><text start="1150.38" dur="5.4">excited about is providing the scale of</text><text start="1153.02" dur="4.56">funding that could come from uh</text><text start="1155.78" dur="4.56">something like markets with the</text><text start="1157.58" dur="6.0">legitimacy and the public goodsness that</text><text start="1160.34" dur="5.64">comes from taxes uh and coordination and</text><text start="1163.58" dur="3.599">so like that type of coordination so it</text><text start="1165.98" dur="5.16">really feels like we&apos;re on the search</text><text start="1167.179" dur="6.12">for how do we move democracy into the</text><text start="1171.14" dur="3.3">web age going from the industrial era</text><text start="1173.299" dur="2.461">where we had like a low resolution</text><text start="1174.44" dur="2.7">environment information resolution</text><text start="1175.76" dur="3.659">environment to creating a high</text><text start="1177.14" dur="4.68">resolution picture of citizens</text><text start="1179.419" dur="4.981">preferences for what kind of public</text><text start="1181.82" dur="5.04">goods that they want and then routing</text><text start="1184.4" dur="4.44">more funds to the thing to to the</text><text start="1186.86" dur="3.42">results of those mechanisms so it feels</text><text start="1188.84" dur="3.48">like as we move from the Industrial Age</text><text start="1190.28" dur="4.74">to the information age there&apos;s a real</text><text start="1192.32" dur="4.92">opportunity to democratize economies and</text><text start="1195.02" dur="4.019">to create higher resolution pictures of</text><text start="1197.24" dur="3.059">what public goods people want which</text><text start="1199.039" dur="2.581">hopefully once we have that picture of</text><text start="1200.299" dur="2.88">what people want that collective</text><text start="1201.62" dur="3.179">intelligence routes more allocation to</text><text start="1203.179" dur="3.061">them are there any other like any thing</text><text start="1204.799" dur="3.481">to say about the category of web-based</text><text start="1206.24" dur="3.72">mechanisms before we get into them no</text><text start="1208.28" dur="4.56">other than I feel like this is where the</text><text start="1209.96" dur="4.62">Innovation starts and uh and and I&apos;m I</text><text start="1212.84" dur="3.48">think that these are actually these are</text><text start="1214.58" dur="3.54">the less successful ones right the ones</text><text start="1216.32" dur="2.88">that have allocated major Capital that&apos;s</text><text start="1218.12" dur="2.64">that&apos;s what we&apos;re going to start with</text><text start="1219.2" dur="2.88">yeah</text><text start="1220.76" dur="2.94">all right well I&apos;m going to start off</text><text start="1222.08" dur="3.479">with one where I&apos;m the most confident</text><text start="1223.7" dur="2.88">and that&apos;s in quadratic funding I don&apos;t</text><text start="1225.559" dur="3.961">know if you&apos;ve ever heard of quadratic</text><text start="1226.58" dur="5.099">funding Griff no never uh please tell me</text><text start="1229.52" dur="4.38">uh so basically this is an idea by Glenn</text><text start="1231.679" dur="4.441">Weil an economist at Microsoft and</text><text start="1233.9" dur="5.639">vitalik buterin who is the lead at the</text><text start="1236.12" dur="4.62">ethereum foundation and it is a</text><text start="1239.539" dur="3.841">mechanism in which you have a</text><text start="1240.74" dur="6.0">crowdfunding campaign that is allocated</text><text start="1243.38" dur="6.0">dollars from a central matching pool and</text><text start="1246.74" dur="3.66">those dollars are allocated on the basis</text><text start="1249.38" dur="3.24">of which projects are more</text><text start="1250.4" dur="4.56">democratically supported as opposed to</text><text start="1252.62" dur="5.04">the ones that more Capital goes into</text><text start="1254.96" dur="4.8">like one-to-one funding uh is inherently</text><text start="1257.66" dur="5.1">plutocratic because it&apos;s driven by the</text><text start="1259.76" dur="4.5">the the needs of capital so if you raise</text><text start="1262.76" dur="3.06">a grant that has a hundred dollars from</text><text start="1264.26" dur="4.08">100 contributors and I raise a grant</text><text start="1265.82" dur="4.32">from a a</text><text start="1268.34" dur="3.54">a project has a hundred dollars from one</text><text start="1270.14" dur="4.14">contributor you&apos;ll get 99 of the</text><text start="1271.88" dur="4.02">matching pool and I think that what&apos;s</text><text start="1274.28" dur="3.12">really cool about that is that we&apos;ve</text><text start="1275.9" dur="5.399">built a collective intelligence</text><text start="1277.4" dur="6.659">mechanism that routes to a route uh</text><text start="1281.299" dur="4.62">money to where the the poor and the many</text><text start="1284.059" dur="4.081">have a preference over the rich and the</text><text start="1285.919" dur="4.26">few and of course uh you know the</text><text start="1288.14" dur="3.6">coolest thing as someone who is involved</text><text start="1290.179" dur="3.301">in get coin and Bitcoin grants is built</text><text start="1291.74" dur="3.12">on top of quadratic funding is that you</text><text start="1293.48" dur="2.939">can give a dollar and depending on how</text><text start="1294.86" dur="3.54">democratically supported your Grant is</text><text start="1296.419" dur="4.321">then it can be worth ten dollars or a</text><text start="1298.4" dur="4.56">hundred dollars or a thousand dollars uh</text><text start="1300.74" dur="3.84">worth of funding for that project and</text><text start="1302.96" dur="2.76">and that really gets people off their</text><text start="1304.58" dur="2.88">butt to</text><text start="1305.72" dur="3.18">donate to their favorite grants which</text><text start="1307.46" dur="2.82">like you they&apos;re giving a dollar but</text><text start="1308.9" dur="3.6">really they&apos;re building an aggregate</text><text start="1310.28" dur="4.68">signal of what public goods want to be</text><text start="1312.5" dur="4.02">funded within that ecosystem so there&apos;s</text><text start="1314.96" dur="3.54">a bunch of problems with this civil</text><text start="1316.52" dur="3.779">attacks making up accounts is one of</text><text start="1318.5" dur="4.86">them how do you raise the matching pool</text><text start="1320.299" dur="5.701">is another but uh you know Bitcoin is</text><text start="1323.36" dur="4.799">built on quadratic funding and uh I&apos;ve</text><text start="1326.0" dur="3.48">seen it kind of go from zero to 72</text><text start="1328.159" dur="3.961">million dollars worth of funding for</text><text start="1329.48" dur="4.38">open source so uh that&apos;s the one that</text><text start="1332.12" dur="3.66">that I think that I&apos;m most familiar with</text><text start="1333.86" dur="5.04">anything to say about quadratic funding</text><text start="1335.78" dur="5.16">Griff I I think it&apos;s amazing and it</text><text start="1338.9" dur="4.139">really starts to make you know people</text><text start="1340.94" dur="4.8">who are donating don&apos;t even feel like it</text><text start="1343.039" dur="5.401">but they&apos;re kind of voting you know and</text><text start="1345.74" dur="5.76">that&apos;s it makes voting fun uh and it</text><text start="1348.44" dur="4.56">also raises more money I I just I like</text><text start="1351.5" dur="3.96">um you know the simple way I think of</text><text start="1353.0" dur="4.38">quadratic funding quadratic funding is</text><text start="1355.46" dur="3.42">that because it also matters how much</text><text start="1357.38" dur="4.14">you donate so it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="1358.88" dur="5.159">mitigating a plutocratic methodology</text><text start="1361.52" dur="4.139">which would be donating right where the</text><text start="1364.039" dur="3.901">the matching funds would normally be</text><text start="1365.659" dur="4.38">plutocratically matched more more</text><text start="1367.94" dur="4.619">donations get more matching and it&apos;s</text><text start="1370.039" dur="4.921">mitigating the plutocratic method with</text><text start="1372.559" dur="5.521">uh like a one person one vote</text><text start="1374.96" dur="6.06">um like style like an identity right uh</text><text start="1378.08" dur="4.68">so civil protection basically so I I</text><text start="1381.02" dur="5.22">think that&apos;s super cool</text><text start="1382.76" dur="4.98">yep so like any mechanism uh it works</text><text start="1386.24" dur="3.48">well in some places and doesn&apos;t work</text><text start="1387.74" dur="3.48">well in others let&apos;s move on to another</text><text start="1389.72" dur="4.079">mechanism do you want to tell us about</text><text start="1391.22" dur="4.62">conviction voting next sure yeah and and</text><text start="1393.799" dur="3.301">uh that I knowing that we have this</text><text start="1395.84" dur="2.64">Google doc we&apos;re going through this</text><text start="1397.1" dur="3.66">that&apos;s why I kind of brought up that</text><text start="1398.48" dur="4.14">initial thing with uh quadratic funding</text><text start="1400.76" dur="3.84">because uh conviction voting mitigates</text><text start="1402.62" dur="4.799">uh plutocracy in a similar way is</text><text start="1404.6" dur="5.459">quadratic funding except it does it with</text><text start="1407.419" dur="5.76">time instead of uh one person one vote</text><text start="1410.059" dur="7.261">it&apos;s like if if you have more tokens you</text><text start="1413.179" dur="6.48">have more say but uh the the even if you</text><text start="1417.32" dur="5.82">just have a minority share you can still</text><text start="1419.659" dur="6.421">pass a large Proposal with with it just</text><text start="1423.14" dur="6.24">takes more time for it to pass so it&apos;s</text><text start="1426.08" dur="5.28">uh it uh it&apos;s just like voting where</text><text start="1429.38" dur="4.44">there&apos;ll be a bunch of proposals but</text><text start="1431.36" dur="5.819">instead of having like a two-week time</text><text start="1433.82" dur="5.04">limit where you say yes or no uh all the</text><text start="1437.179" dur="4.681">proposals are competing against each</text><text start="1438.86" dur="5.24">other and you allocate your tokens to</text><text start="1441.86" dur="5.34">the ones that you like them most and</text><text start="1444.1" dur="4.54">there&apos;s kind of a the conviction voting</text><text start="1447.2" dur="3.12">comes from the big brains behind block</text><text start="1448.64" dur="4.38">science like Michael zargham was</text><text start="1450.32" dur="6.06">implemented at one Hive mostly by Sam</text><text start="1453.02" dur="5.639">and Gabby uh and will J Griff and those</text><text start="1456.38" dur="5.039">guys uh put put it all together so that</text><text start="1458.659" dur="4.321">when you&apos;re it works really well if</text><text start="1461.419" dur="3.601">there&apos;s a lot of proposals competing</text><text start="1462.98" dur="4.26">against each other and a clear budget of</text><text start="1465.02" dur="4.56">how much you want to allocate uh in a</text><text start="1467.24" dur="4.2">given time then conviction voting is a</text><text start="1469.58" dur="5.64">great solution and actually it&apos;s also</text><text start="1471.44" dur="5.64">been augmented uh so that it can be more</text><text start="1475.22" dur="3.78">of a streaming approach so the more</text><text start="1477.08" dur="3.839">tokens that are behind instead of The</text><text start="1479.0" dur="5.34">Proposal passing like in conviction</text><text start="1480.919" dur="6.0">voting the tokens kind of sit behind a</text><text start="1484.34" dur="5.48">proposal and you can take them on or off</text><text start="1486.919" dur="5.941">at any time but then it gains conviction</text><text start="1489.82" dur="4.719">uh the longer the tokens sit there and</text><text start="1492.86" dur="4.439">eventually once it meets the threshold</text><text start="1494.539" dur="5.52">which is based on of how much money it&apos;s</text><text start="1497.299" dur="4.681">asking for all that money goes to the</text><text start="1500.059" dur="4.021">person asking for the money with</text><text start="1501.98" dur="4.559">automatic fund Dean which is this new</text><text start="1504.08" dur="5.16">augmentation of it instead it&apos;s like</text><text start="1506.539" dur="4.561">there&apos;s a constant stream to all of the</text><text start="1509.24" dur="4.26">proposals that are requesting funds that</text><text start="1511.1" dur="5.819">have tokens behind them and you can kind</text><text start="1513.5" dur="6.36">of measure you can kind of change the</text><text start="1516.919" dur="5.161">rate that&apos;s going of funding to the</text><text start="1519.86" dur="5.28">different proposals so it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="1522.08" dur="5.099">radical drips but with a token behind it</text><text start="1525.14" dur="5.399">where you&apos;re voting on how to allocate</text><text start="1527.179" dur="4.681">the funds of the collective funds so I</text><text start="1530.539" dur="4.14">mean it seems like the powerful thing</text><text start="1531.86" dur="4.919">here is that I can take my tokens which</text><text start="1534.679" dur="4.86">represent my share of some Dao or some</text><text start="1536.779" dur="5.76">resource and I can put them into a</text><text start="1539.539" dur="5.88">bucket and over time conviction is</text><text start="1542.539" dur="4.441">developed by the number of tokens times</text><text start="1545.419" dur="4.86">the amount of time that it&apos;s been in</text><text start="1546.98" dur="6.6">that bucket and that gives some signal</text><text start="1550.279" dur="4.681">to the system that uh this is a good</text><text start="1553.58" dur="3.3">proposal</text><text start="1554.96" dur="4.26">um and so the more the more money and</text><text start="1556.88" dur="4.919">the more time that it has been in that</text><text start="1559.22" dur="4.62">system than the more uh we can have</text><text start="1561.799" dur="4.081">conviction that that people actually</text><text start="1563.84" dur="4.02">care about that thing and I think what&apos;s</text><text start="1565.88" dur="3.539">really cool is that</text><text start="1567.86" dur="3.419">um I think we looked at when back when I</text><text start="1569.419" dur="5.341">was a Bitcoin Dao we we looked at</text><text start="1571.279" dur="5.041">conviction voting as a way of doing</text><text start="1574.76" dur="3.24">um budget proposals where instead of</text><text start="1576.32" dur="3.3">having this quarterly budget where it&apos;s</text><text start="1578.0" dur="3.779">like yes or no you either get this</text><text start="1579.62" dur="4.14">amount of tokens or you don&apos;t we could</text><text start="1581.779" dur="4.081">just take conviction on the causes that</text><text start="1583.76" dur="3.299">we care about and then you know say</text><text start="1585.86" dur="2.88">instead of getting a hundred thousand</text><text start="1587.059" dur="3.301">tokens for this big quarterly budget</text><text start="1588.74" dur="4.14">process I could just take a certain</text><text start="1590.36" dur="5.04">amount of tokens and if like say I need</text><text start="1592.88" dur="4.679">to like pay for pizza or like laptops or</text><text start="1595.4" dur="4.139">something like that then</text><text start="1597.559" dur="4.081">um for smaller amounts of funding it&apos;s</text><text start="1599.539" dur="4.26">such a lower risk way of creating a</text><text start="1601.64" dur="4.2">decentralized market for which causes</text><text start="1603.799" dur="3.36">are good and and so I could take</text><text start="1605.84" dur="3.12">conviction on those things and there</text><text start="1607.159" dur="3.0">would be a bucket of money that no one</text><text start="1608.96" dur="2.819">has to go through this big budget</text><text start="1610.159" dur="3.541">process to get and they could get it</text><text start="1611.779" dur="3.541">through conviction voting so that&apos;s a</text><text start="1613.7" dur="2.82">plus of conviction voting that I&apos;m aware</text><text start="1615.32" dur="3.42">of you know what do you think the pluses</text><text start="1616.52" dur="4.139">and minuses are here I I think</text><text start="1618.74" dur="3.84">conviction voting works really well as</text><text start="1620.659" dur="3.781">long as there&apos;s a lot of proposals when</text><text start="1622.58" dur="3.9">there&apos;s not a lot of proposals happening</text><text start="1624.44" dur="4.26">it&apos;s too easy sometimes to pass a</text><text start="1626.48" dur="5.28">proposal because you basically mandating</text><text start="1628.7" dur="6.24">the Dow to spend money at a certain rate</text><text start="1631.76" dur="5.159">uh yeah effectively and so it&apos;s really</text><text start="1634.94" dur="4.14">easy to pass proposals if there&apos;s not a</text><text start="1636.919" dur="4.441">lot of competition so I think it works</text><text start="1639.08" dur="4.199">really well for big big things and and</text><text start="1641.36" dur="5.1">like the biggest plus is exactly that</text><text start="1643.279" dur="5.941">that um minority opinions can actually</text><text start="1646.46" dur="5.64">pass proposals like I think like like</text><text start="1649.22" dur="5.16">even if there&apos;s a small group of people</text><text start="1652.1" dur="5.4">that are have a lot of conviction behind</text><text start="1654.38" dur="6.419">this idea but the majority doesn&apos;t like</text><text start="1657.5" dur="5.279">it uh now in a normal Dao situation that</text><text start="1660.799" dur="3.541">just could never happen like they</text><text start="1662.779" dur="3.841">couldn&apos;t pass it but in conviction</text><text start="1664.34" dur="4.439">voting they could as long as they had</text><text start="1666.62" dur="4.439">enough of enough conviction they were</text><text start="1668.779" dur="4.38">patient enough to hold their tokens</text><text start="1671.059" dur="5.1">behind that concept and then it would</text><text start="1673.159" dur="4.5">pass and so I I think it&apos;s the coolest</text><text start="1676.159" dur="3.961">thing the biggest plus is that Minority</text><text start="1677.659" dur="5.4">of opinions can actually pass a pass</text><text start="1680.12" dur="5.58">proposals but you know the next one is</text><text start="1683.059" dur="5.161">really good as well which is retroactive</text><text start="1685.7" dur="4.26">public goods funding and I I know I know</text><text start="1688.22" dur="4.02">you know a lot more about this than I do</text><text start="1689.96" dur="4.74">honestly so I&apos;ll sling it your way yeah</text><text start="1692.24" dur="4.2">uh well I wish Carl flourish was uh Carl</text><text start="1694.7" dur="3.78">Flores was like my second podcast guest</text><text start="1696.44" dur="3.839">on the Greenfield podcast and he&apos;s an</text><text start="1698.48" dur="3.54">inspiration always I wish he was here to</text><text start="1700.279" dur="2.76">explain it because they at optimism</text><text start="1702.02" dur="3.12">they&apos;re actually implementing</text><text start="1703.039" dur="3.661">retroactive public goods funding it&apos;s</text><text start="1705.14" dur="3.3">basically a way of doing public goods</text><text start="1706.7"

well</text><text start="1802.039" dur="3.601">I can assume that optimism is going to</text><text start="1803.96" dur="4.14">have n millions of dollars worth of</text><text start="1805.64"

you&apos;ve</text><text start="1822.86" dur="3.0">got this future expectation of</text><text start="1824.12" dur="3.48">retroactive public goods so there&apos;s a</text><text start="1825.86" dur="2.819">reflexivity between the present Behavior</text><text start="1827.6" dur="4.14">and the amount of public goods that are</text><text start="1828.679" dur="5.581">created and the future

that was a lot okay it is a lot but</text><text start="1840.08" dur="2.819">and and that&apos;s that&apos;s probably the</text><text start="1841.52" dur="3.36">biggest challenges for retroactive</text><text start="1842.899" dur="4.201">public goods at least it like I think</text><text start="1844.88" dur="5.1">that retroactive public goods on the</text><text start="1847.1" dur="6.0">base layer is a perfect mechanism in a</text><text start="1849.98" dur="4.86">way because it cannot fail it will fund</text><text start="1853.1" dur="3.24">some public goods you know well the</text><text start="1854.84" dur="3.66">other thing is like it&apos;s easier to see</text><text start="1856.34" dur="4.14">say what has provided value in the past</text><text start="1858.5" dur="3.24">than speculate on what is going to</text><text start="1860.48" dur="2.76">provide value in the future so the</text><text start="1861.74" dur="3.78">retroactive thing makes things way</text><text start="1863.24" dur="4.86">harder on one dimension but also way</text><text start="1865.52" dur="4.32">easier on another dimension and it makes</text><text start="1868.1" dur="3.78">it easier on the hardest dimension which</text><text start="1869.84" dur="4.02">is distribution you know all of these</text><text start="1871.88" dur="3.6">all of these goals most of the most of</text><text start="1873.86" dur="4.199">these mechanisms it&apos;s like how do we</text><text start="1875.48" dur="4.439">distribute funds to the right people and</text><text start="1878.059" dur="3.48">retroactive public goods funding just</text><text start="1879.919" dur="4.561">kind of says don&apos;t worry about it let&apos;s</text><text start="1881.539" dur="5.161">just see who succeeds right yeah and and</text><text start="1884.48" dur="5.52">that&apos;s huge now bootstrapping the market</text><text start="1886.7" dur="5.099">that it might potentially derive that&apos;s</text><text start="1890.0" dur="3.6">going to be a lot of work that&apos;s the</text><text start="1891.799" dur="4.201">biggest challenge is that is achieving</text><text start="1893.6" dur="4.439">the full-on dream but yeah there&apos;s no</text><text start="1896.0" dur="3.779">fail like if you you have a donation pot</text><text start="1898.039" dur="3.901">retroactive public goods funding is such</text><text start="1899.779" dur="3.841">a great strategy yeah</text><text start="1901.94" dur="3.06">I mean I I think that now that we&apos;ve</text><text start="1903.62" dur="2.88">gone through quadratic funding</text><text start="1905.0" dur="2.76">conviction voting and retroactive public</text><text start="1906.5" dur="2.94">goods funding I want to say a couple</text><text start="1907.76" dur="4.139">things about the category of these web</text><text start="1909.44" dur="4.44">era mechanisms together the first is</text><text start="1911.899" dur="5.701">that they&apos;re each comprised of a funding</text><text start="1913.88" dur="5.88">source and a distribution mechanism so</text><text start="1917.6" dur="4.559">quadratic funding is donor-based at</text><text start="1919.76" dur="4.08">least on bitcoin it&apos;s donor based and uh</text><text start="1922.159" dur="4.74">the distribution mechanism is quadratic</text><text start="1923.84" dur="4.86">funding conviction voting uh is based</text><text start="1926.899" dur="4.5">off of some Dow wanting to distribute</text><text start="1928.7" dur="4.32">their Treasury and the mechanism is</text><text start="1931.399" dur="3.481">conviction voting retroactive public</text><text start="1933.02" dur="3.6">goods funding on optimism is funded by</text><text start="1934.88" dur="5.22">optimism sequencer fees and then the</text><text start="1936.62" dur="6.059">mechanism is this actually like uh</text><text start="1940.1" dur="4.679">witness expert based panels that</text><text start="1942.679" dur="3.48">determine where the money goes and so</text><text start="1944.779" dur="3.9">what I think is really cool as we&apos;re</text><text start="1946.159" dur="4.981">exploring this design space is how can</text><text start="1948.679" dur="4.86">we mix and match the funding sources</text><text start="1951.14" dur="3.779">with the mechanisms and create more</text><text start="1953.539" dur="3.36">diversity in how public goods are</text><text start="1954.919" dur="3.301">funding by I don&apos;t know maybe we can</text><text start="1956.899" dur="3.0">sprinkle a little bit of quadratic</text><text start="1958.22" dur="4.319">funding into retroactive public goods</text><text start="1959.899" dur="4.921">funding or conviction voting on top of</text><text start="1962.539" dur="4.26">quadratic funding can layer uh together</text><text start="1964.82" dur="3.599">in a pluralistic way and when you have</text><text start="1966.799"

modularly</text><text start="1972.62" dur="3.36">with each other but can be stacked on</text><text start="1974.36" dur="2.76">top of each other what you&apos;re starting</text><text start="1975.98"

multiple</text><text start="1990.74" dur="4.559">mechanisms and funding sources so I</text><text start="1993.799" dur="2.461">don&apos;t know that&apos;s just me zooming out a</text><text start="1995.299" dur="3.541">little bit on if you have anything to</text><text start="1996.26" dur="4.799">add there Griff public goods Legos you</text><text start="1998.84" dur="4.38">know that&apos;s that&apos;s the meme and and I</text><text start="2001.059" dur="5.161">think that it&apos;s uh it&apos;s the way you know</text><text start="2003.22" dur="5.22">we we all we have to I Love The</text><text start="2006.22" dur="4.199">Practical pluralism that uh you and</text><text start="2008.44" dur="4.44">Aaron are often pushing out there where</text><text start="2010.419"

dur="3.839">be a systemic incentive for all the</text><text start="2081.28" dur="5.46">world&apos;s agents humans but hopefully one</text><text start="2083.379" dur="6.121">day&apos;s AI is to uh fund the commons to</text><text start="2086.74" dur="4.139">support the commons and I think that you</text><text start="2089.5" dur="2.399">know just the fact that that income</text><text start="2090.879" dur="3.661">stream will be coming from multiple</text><text start="2091.899" dur="4.5">mechanisms and sources will create much</text><text start="2094.54" dur="3.48">stronger of a mechanism than if we

like</text><text start="2115.24" dur="5.4">um uh how mechanisms and funding streams</text><text start="2118.0" dur="4.98">can come together and I think uh we</text><text start="2120.64" dur="3.9">would be amiss not to add nfts we</text><text start="2122.98" dur="3.24">actually talked before this call you</text><text start="2124.54" dur="3.299">know and like to try to scramble all</text><text start="2126.22" dur="3.96">these this one didn&apos;t really come up but</text><text start="2127.839" dur="4.26">it&apos;s like in the last couple years it is</text><text start="2130.18" dur="5.04">a huge funding stream for public goods</text><text start="2132.099" dur="5.401">uh and and like public nouns and uh</text><text start="2135.22" dur="5.22">rainbow rolls and so many nft projects</text><text start="2137.5" dur="4.92">for Charities or for Arts uh that are</text><text start="2140.44" dur="4.5">really creating a public good like</text><text start="2142.42" dur="4.74">especially like nft art is so cool</text><text start="2144.94" dur="4.62">because the art is accessible to anyone</text><text start="2147.16" dur="4.919">yes there there&apos;s and then they kind of</text><text start="2149.56" dur="4.92">create a digital scarcity around that</text><text start="2152.079" dur="4.741">piece of art and the the fact that it&apos;s</text><text start="2154.48" dur="4.56">a scarce resource all of a sudden allows</text><text start="2156.82" dur="4.5">it to create value so the artist can</text><text start="2159.04" dur="4.52">fund their public a good creation which</text><text start="2161.32" dur="4.86">is hey Art that anyone can see online</text><text start="2163.56" dur="4.72">you can go to openc and it&apos;s like the</text><text start="2166.18" dur="4.62">you know the the right click save is</text><text start="2168.28" dur="5.16">like stealing an nft right but they&apos;re</text><text start="2170.8" dur="5.94">actually proving the point which is that</text><text start="2173.44" dur="6.36">especially nft art or whether it&apos;s music</text><text start="2176.74" dur="6.119">or art or uh any kind of art</text><text start="2179.8" dur="5.76">it&apos;s uh it&apos;s created this accessibility</text><text start="2182.859" dur="4.381">which makes the color good while also</text><text start="2185.56" dur="4.019">creating a very unique funding stream</text><text start="2187.24" dur="4.74">and uh like there&apos;s this really cool</text><text start="2189.579" dur="4.741">project called uh public nouns which is</text><text start="2191.98" dur="5.639">using the nouns strategy of auctioning</text><text start="2194.32" dur="5.94">off uh one nft out of regular Cadence in</text><text start="2197.619" dur="5.401">public nouns it&apos;s every 12 hours to</text><text start="2200.26" dur="4.74">raise funds just to donate to projects</text><text start="2203.02" dur="4.38">you know and right now they just use</text><text start="2205.0" dur="4.44">classical voting but they could easily</text><text start="2207.4" dur="4.62">take the take these streams and donate</text><text start="2209.44" dur="5.159">it to quadratic funding to to the</text><text start="2212.02" dur="5.7">matching pool on git coin or to other</text><text start="2214.599" dur="5.0">various mechanisms so I think nfts are</text><text start="2217.72" dur="5.82">like the the probably the biggest</text><text start="2219.599" dur="6.221">mainstream uh funding stream for digital</text><text start="2223.54" dur="4.5">public goods that we&apos;ve seen come out of</text><text start="2225.82" dur="4.08">the web era mechanisms</text><text start="2228.04" dur="4.26">yeah I think that you know this thing</text><text start="2229.9" dur="4.679">about nfts makes me want to talk about a</text><text start="2232.3" dur="3.84">concept called Network goods and</text><text start="2234.579" dur="4.081">basically what it is is like private</text><text start="2236.14" dur="5.4">goods are rival risk like if I if I have</text><text start="2238.66" dur="4.86">this iPhone you can&apos;t have that iPhone</text><text start="2241.54" dur="3.72">um and public goods are things that are</text><text start="2243.52" dur="4.86">non-rival risks like I can breathe clean</text><text start="2245.26" dur="4.26">air and you can uh breathe clean air but</text><text start="2248.38" dur="3.36">there&apos;s a category of goods called</text><text start="2249.52" dur="4.26">Network Goods get that get more valuable</text><text start="2251.74" dur="4.44">the more people consume them and like</text><text start="2253.78" dur="4.68">open source software is an example of</text><text start="2256.18" dur="4.02">this the more people download this npm</text><text start="2258.46" dur="3.84">package and submit their bug reports</text><text start="2260.2" dur="3.36">back and kick the tires on it the more</text><text start="2262.3" dur="2.819">valuable it becomes for every other</text><text start="2263.56" dur="3.24">person who downloads that open source</text><text start="2265.119" dur="4.141">project and this is what I think the</text><text start="2266.8" dur="4.559">value accrual mechanism between nft with</text><text start="2269.26" dur="4.02">nfts are is that the more attention is</text><text start="2271.359" dur="4.22">accrued to a piece of art whether it&apos;s</text><text start="2273.28" dur="4.98">music or an image or a movie that is</text><text start="2275.579" dur="3.701">nftized the more value is attributed to</text><text start="2278.26" dur="3.12">that it&apos;s the same reason like</text><text start="2279.28" dur="4.2">information wants

of SPF and who is</text><text start="2389.8" dur="6.18">a prominent web3 well not even web three</text><text start="2392.02" dur="5.88">but like uh effective altruist and</text><text start="2395.98" dur="3.9">um you know the SPF and the FTX things</text><text start="2397.9" dur="4.62">uh aside I do think that effective</text><text start="2399.88" dur="4.32">altruism is is worth going through so</text><text start="2402.52" dur="4.2">basically effective altruism as I</text><text start="2404.2" dur="5.22">understand it is basically based off of</text><text start="2406.72" dur="4.379">the idea that we don&apos;t give to have an</text><text start="2409.42" dur="4.98">impact we actually mostly</text><text start="2411.099" dur="5.821">psychologically give in order to feel</text><text start="2414.4" dur="4.98">better about ourselves so you know I can</text><text start="2416.92" dur="4.919">I I feel better about my impact on the</text><text start="2419.38" dur="4.199">world and and and and what I&apos;ve done if</text><text start="2421.839" dur="3.181">I&apos;ve given to a cause and I don&apos;t</text><text start="2423.579" dur="3.421">actually really care if it creates</text><text start="2425.02" dur="5.16">actual tangible impact in the world and</text><text start="2427.0" dur="5.28">so effective altruism kind of is as a</text><text start="2430.18" dur="4.02">philosophy and and</text><text start="2432.28" dur="3.299">um you know uh I think that different</text><text start="2434.2" dur="3.0">people implemented in different ways</text><text start="2435.579" dur="3.54">which is maybe why I don&apos;t totally</text><text start="2437.2" dur="3.3">discount it in the wake of FD tx&apos;s</text><text start="2439.119" dur="4.261">collapse and all the problems we&apos;ve</text><text start="2440.5" dur="6.92">discovered with FTX is basically</text><text start="2443.38" dur="7.14">what if we categorized causes by which</text><text start="2447.42" dur="4.6">causes and and programs for creating</text><text start="2450.52" dur="4.38">good in the world we&apos;re creating the</text><text start="2452.02" dur="5.4">most good on a utilitarian basis so</text><text start="2454.9" dur="4.74">basically uh if you create a if you</text><text start="2457.42" dur="3.78">create a really data analytic based</text><text start="2459.64" dur="3.18">approach to this and I think that</text><text start="2461.2" dur="4.56">there&apos;s projects like give well that do</text><text start="2462.82" dur="5.7">this I can figure out that by</text><text start="2465.76" dur="4.98">um by giving five dollars I can these</text><text start="2468.52" dur="4.92">numbers are just made up but I can get</text><text start="2470.74" dur="4.74">get five malaria Nets which in certain</text><text start="2473.44" dur="4.86">parts of the world will save a hundred</text><text start="2475.48" dur="4.44">lives over the course of 10 or 15 years</text><text start="2478.3" dur="3.18">and you know</text><text start="2479.92" dur="3.659">um you know as opposed to giving that</text><text start="2481.48" dur="4.26">same money to some other cause that has</text><text start="2483.579" dur="4.441">less utilitarian impact on the world so</text><text start="2485.74" dur="5.099">what if we could rank our causes measure</text><text start="2488.02" dur="4.8">the actual impact of those causes and</text><text start="2490.839" dur="4.5">only give to the projects that have that</text><text start="2492.82" dur="4.44">are the most effective out there so Sam</text><text start="2495.339" dur="3.181">Harris is a prominent podcaster that I</text><text start="2497.26" dur="3.78">follow that is really into effective</text><text start="2498.52" dur="5.4">altruism and I think that effective</text><text start="2501.04" dur="4.319">altruism is uh really interesting when</text><text start="2503.92" dur="3.54">it&apos;s paired with this idea of a giving</text><text start="2505.359" dur="4.201">what you can pledge Sam Harris I think</text><text start="2507.46" dur="3.96">pledges ten percent of his income to</text><text start="2509.56" dur="3.539">effective altruism and he just has it on</text><text start="2511.42" dur="4.8">auto debit on these sites called</text><text start="2513.099" dur="5.581">givewell that uh will effectively like</text><text start="2516.22" dur="4.32">give to as many of the causes that are</text><text start="2518.68" dur="3.3">vetted to be good as possible one</text><text start="2520.54" dur="3.9">criticism I&apos;ve seen of effective</text><text start="2521.98" dur="5.28">altruism is that it only gives to things</text><text start="2524.44" dur="4.5">that have impact today and so if you&apos;re</text><text start="2527.26" dur="4.02">trying to get an altruist project off</text><text start="2528.94" dur="3.96">the ground in the future and it&apos;s not</text><text start="2531.28" dur="3.42">proven to be effective yet you don&apos;t</text><text start="2532.9" dur="3.9">really have that seed Capital so it only</text><text start="2534.7" dur="3.659">works well at scale and so there&apos;s kind</text><text start="2536.8" dur="3.66">of a consolidation effect that happens</text><text start="2538.359" dur="3.961">with effective altruism another</text><text start="2540.46" dur="4.26">criticism that I&apos;ve heard of effective</text><text start="2542.32" dur="4.74">altruism is this idea of earn to give</text><text start="2544.72" dur="4.98">which is basically what SPF was doing</text><text start="2547.06" dur="3.96">where he created a giant Ponzi scheme we</text><text start="2549.7" dur="3.18">think it was a Ponzi it&apos;s an alleged</text><text start="2551.02" dur="3.18">Ponzi scheme and basically was going to</text><text start="2552.88" dur="4.38">earn billions of dollars and give it</text><text start="2554.2" dur="4.98">away 99 of it uh well he thought to</text><text start="2557.26" dur="4.14">effective altruist cause is he ended up</text><text start="2559.18" dur="4.62">giving up 99 of it because the market</text><text start="2561.4" dur="4.5">imploded around his thing but he in the</text><text start="2563.8" dur="4.559">in the Fallout of that market implosion</text><text start="2565.9" dur="4.02">he didn&apos;t actually like he just</text><text start="2568.359" dur="3.0">basically used effective altruism to</text><text start="2569.92" dur="3.3">whitewash his reputation and all the</text><text start="2571.359" dur="3.301">damage he was doing in the in in the</text><text start="2573.22" dur="2.76">world by saying that he was going to</text><text start="2574.66" dur="2.52">earn to give he was going to earn a lot</text><text start="2575.98" dur="4.5">of money and then eventually give it</text><text start="2577.18" dur="4.8">away so uh people are earned to give has</text><text start="2580.48" dur="3.9">kind of had a damaged reputation because</text><text start="2581.98" dur="4.68">of that and now people are thinking well</text><text start="2584.38" dur="4.38">you should just give along the way as</text><text start="2586.66" dur="3.78">you&apos;re earning and and coming up in the</text><text start="2588.76" dur="3.3">world so I know that&apos;s my my little</text><text start="2590.44" dur="3.3">three-minute rant on effective altruism</text><text start="2592.06" dur="3.72">you got any takes on effective altruism</text><text start="2593.74" dur="4.079">Griff I mean the hardest thing is</text><text start="2595.78" dur="4.62">generating impact data this is such a</text><text start="2597.819" dur="4.981">challenge you know impact impact is by</text><text start="2600.4" dur="3.9">nature qualitative and we&apos;re trying to</text><text start="2602.8" dur="4.559">turn it into something that we can</text><text start="2604.3" dur="5.1">quantify it&apos;s like quantify how</text><text start="2607.359" dur="4.26">beautiful the sunset is quantify how</text><text start="2609.4" dur="4.5">delicious your your favorite dish by</text><text start="2611.619" dur="4.801">your mom is you know it&apos;s just these</text><text start="2613.9" dur="4.08">things are you know quantify like you</text><text start="2616.42" dur="3.3">know they&apos;re not fungible with each</text><text start="2617.98" dur="4.26">other yeah like how do you value a</text><text start="2619.72" dur="4.26">sunset versus like a saved life versus</text><text start="2622.24" dur="3.48">like the taste of your own meal porridge</text><text start="2623.98" dur="3.06">in the morning it&apos;s it&apos;s hard to</text><text start="2625.72" dur="4.139">collapse those all into one dimension</text><text start="2627.04" dur="4.98">like a money Vector yeah it&apos;s just it&apos;s</text><text start="2629.859" dur="4.021">it&apos;s just a really it&apos;s it&apos;s really an</text><text start="2632.02" dur="4.559">impossible challenge it&apos;s a it&apos;s</text><text start="2633.88" dur="3.78">manageable it&apos;s a best management I do</text><text start="2636.579" dur="3.361">think there&apos;s some interesting ethical</text><text start="2637.66" dur="3.84">dilemmas that come up there where you&apos;re</text><text start="2639.94" dur="3.12">basically like well don&apos;t we have a</text><text start="2641.5" dur="3.66">moral like if you were walking down the</text><text start="2643.06" dur="4.14">street and you saw someone who just got</text><text start="2645.16" dur="5.459">hit by a car you would absolutely go to</text><text start="2647.2" dur="5.7">them and try to help them but the same</text><text start="2650.619" dur="4.081">thing we know that across the world</text><text start="2652.9" dur="4.14">there are people dying of entirely</text><text start="2654.7" dur="4.08">preventable causes but we go through our</text><text start="2657.04" dur="3.72">days and we don&apos;t spend our money on</text><text start="2658.78" dur="4.86">allocating and so I think that trying to</text><text start="2660.76" dur="5.579">quantify those things it brings up some</text><text start="2663.64" dur="4.8">interesting ethical questions uh about</text><text start="2666.339" dur="3.961">why we do what we do and why why our</text><text start="2668.44" dur="4.919">Capital goes to the things we do but I</text><text start="2670.3" dur="5.1">think that in general it&apos;s very hard to</text><text start="2673.359" dur="3.24">collapse all of value into one vector</text><text start="2675.4" dur="2.88">which is money</text><text start="2676.599" dur="3.781">yeah um</text><text start="2678.28" dur="3.78">actually I may I I may violate our</text><text start="2680.38" dur="3.36">schedule that we had here at Griff and</text><text start="2682.06" dur="5.34">talk about hyperserts next if that&apos;s</text><text start="2683.74" dur="5.04">okay yeah okay so yeah so um full</text><text start="2687.4" dur="2.82">disclosure this is a project that I&apos;m</text><text start="2688.78" dur="3.299">working on with protocol labs and we&apos;re</text><text start="2690.22" dur="4.2">going to have an episode on it soon and</text><text start="2692.079" dur="4.561">basically hyper certs are basically what</text><text start="2694.42" dur="4.199">if you um everyone&apos;s are you familiar</text><text start="2696.64" dur="5.4">with the idea of carbon credits Griff of</text><text start="2698.619" dur="5.821">course so so yeah I I if I take 10 tons</text><text start="2702.04" dur="4.38">of carbon out of the atmosphere uh then</text><text start="2704.44" dur="3.78">I can get a carbon credit that says that</text><text start="2706.42" dur="5.64">I did that and that might have a market</text><text start="2708.22" dur="6.18">value so what if we could generalize a</text><text start="2712.06" dur="6.18">carbon credit into any impact Vector I</text><text start="2714.4" dur="5.52">fixed 10 potholes in my community I uh I</text><text start="2718.24" dur="4.02">picked up 10 pieces of trash in my</text><text

uh any impact out could</text><text start="2726.94" dur="4.139">issue hyper certs when they actually</text><text start="2728.98" dur="4.56">have a positive impact on the world and</text><text start="2731.079" dur="4.081">then what you can do is you can</text><text start="2733.54" dur="3.36">bootstrap a Marketplace of impact</text><text start="2735.16" dur="3.48">evaluators that say okay I actually</text><text start="2736.9" dur="4.14">verify that this thing had an impact act</text><text start="2738.64" dur="4.439">and this this impact owl isn&apos;t full of</text><text start="2741.04" dur="4.02">shape and then what if you could get</text><text start="2743.079" dur="3.961">people who want to collect those hyper</text><text start="2745.06" dur="4.08">asserts in order to show how virtuous</text><text start="2747.04" dur="4.02">they are so you know web 2 is all about</text><text start="2749.14" dur="3.719">virtue signaling web3 could be about</text><text start="2751.06"

dur="2.639">you can tell but I&apos;m really excited</text><text start="2790.66" dur="2.939">about hyperserts by the way I think this</text><text start="2792.339" dur="3.0">solves the biggest problem that you said</text><text start="2793.599" dur="3.0">with effective altruism which is how do</text><text start="2795.339" dur="2.941">you measure</text><text start="2796.599" dur="3.061">the causes

dur="4.74">happening uh any comments on</text><text start="2813.52" dur="5.339">hyperservice orea oh yeah no I mean I&apos;m</text><text start="2816.339" dur="3.78">all I feel like hyper certs have a huge</text><text start="2818.859" dur="4.681">opportunity because it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="2820.119" dur="7.141">effective altruism plus nfts unless you</text><text start="2823.54" dur="5.52">centralization yeah and and uh I I feel</text><text start="2827.26" dur="4.319">like the market opportunities there are</text><text start="2829.06" dur="4.5">huge the biggest challenge I I mean I&apos;m</text><text start="2831.579" dur="4.5">just curious why these haven&apos;t worked in</text><text start="2833.56" dur="4.799">traditional systems you know like uh</text><text start="2836.079" dur="4.921">their their their impact markets have</text><text start="2838.359" dur="4.021">been a thing before nfts and and yeah</text><text start="2841.0" dur="3.72">but you don&apos;t see them in the</text><text start="2842.38" dur="3.6">traditional world so my biggest uh my</text><text start="2844.72" dur="3.24">biggest question I I don&apos;t know if you</text><text

going to be different yeah</text><text start="2852.099" dur="4.921">well there wasn&apos;t a perfect coordination</text><text start="2853.839" dur="5.821">substrate for them Griff</text><text start="2857.02" dur="4.68">um I I I&apos;m personally [ __ ] posting but I</text><text start="2859.66" dur="3.6">do think with the scale of a global</text><text start="2861.7" dur="3.659">transparent programmable immutable</text><text start="2863.26" dur="3.72">Ledger things will be different</text><text start="2865.359" dur="3.781">um but you know what uh one thing that</text><text start="2866.98" dur="3.54">I&apos;ve learned about carbon carbon credits</text><text start="2869.14" dur="3.78">which is kind of the only example of</text><text start="2870.52" dur="4.02">hyper certs that are at scale right now</text><text start="2872.92" dur="3.78">or I guess like a subset of what</text><text start="2874.54" dur="4.2">hyperserts could do at scale is that 99</text><text start="2876.7" dur="4.86">of the buy pressure is government</text><text start="2878.74" dur="5.7">mandated so if you&apos;re a stock that has</text><text start="2881.56" dur="4.559">to have hit some sort of ESG mandate you</text><text start="2884.44" dur="3.419">don&apos;t actually reduce your emissions you</text><text start="2886.119" dur="3.48">just purchase hyper certs or sorry I</text><text start="2887.859" dur="3.181">carbon credits to get out of it so the</text><text start="2889.599" dur="3.061">real question is how do you bootstrap by</text><text start="2891.04" dur="3.779">pressure in a decentralized way where</text><text start="2892.66" dur="4.14">there is no mandates do you get vitalik</text><text start="2894.819" dur="3.361">to tweet about it do you integrate them</text><text start="2896.8" dur="5.58">into Bitcoin grants so that every</text><text start="2898.18" dur="6.24">contribution is in hyper purchase or do</text><text start="2902.38" dur="3.36">you uh integrate them with like Tinder</text><text start="2904.42" dur="3.48">so that you can show how virtuous you</text><text start="2905.74" dur="3.72">are uh when you&apos;re when you&apos;re trying to</text><text start="2907.9" dur="3.24">get a date or something like that so</text><text start="2909.46" dur="3.3">bootstrapping the buy pressure I think</text><text start="2911.14" dur="3.42">is is the hardest part of of</text><text start="2912.76" dur="4.14">hyperservice if we could use our social</text><text start="2914.56" dur="3.84">and cultural power to make it cool to</text><text start="2916.9" dur="3.24">collect these things and to show them</text><text start="2918.4" dur="3.24">off then I think that there&apos;s maybe</text><text start="2920.14" dur="3.6">something there</text><text start="2921.64" dur="4.38">I think there&apos;s a lot there I think</text><text start="2923.74" dur="4.68">hyper certs have have a lot of legs and</text><text start="2926.02" dur="5.819">I I they&apos;re a perfect public goods Lego</text><text start="2928.42" dur="5.28">you know uh if at least like because the</text><text start="2931.839" dur="3.961">dream is you know that we can create a</text><text start="2933.7" dur="4.2">market around it if nothing else we can</text><text start="2935.8" dur="4.019">create a donation Market a donation game</text><text start="2937.9" dur="3.9">around it so</text><text start="2939.819" dur="4.141">uh and and it kind of leads into the</text><text start="2941.8" dur="3.84">next one which is the augmented bonding</text><text start="2943.96" dur="4.8">curve because the augmented bonding</text><text start="2945.64" dur="5.04">curve is is uh is solves some of those</text><text start="2948.76" dur="5.46">problems about bootstrapping the market</text><text start="2950.68" dur="5.76">uh because uh the the go so bonding</text><text start="2954.22" dur="3.96">curves big words scary word it&apos;s really</text><text start="2956.44" dur="5.04">actually pretty simple it&apos;s just a smart</text><text start="2958.18" dur="5.7">contract that mints and burns tokens on</text><text start="2961.48" dur="4.44">demand and holds the money that it</text><text start="2963.88" dur="4.68">collects when it means when it mints the</text><text start="2965.92" dur="4.38">token right so you know uh but the</text><text start="2968.56" dur="4.259">coolest thing about a bonding curve is</text><text start="2970.3" dur="5.279">that it solves the liquidity issues and</text><text start="2972.819" dur="5.401">the the price Discovery issues for low</text><text start="2975.579" dur="4.381">liquid markets so uh what I love about</text><text start="2978.22" dur="4.859">bonding curves is you can use them to</text><text start="2979.96" dur="5.46">start up small marketplaces uh like a</text><text start="2983.079" dur="4.081">small market like uh what would be a</text><text start="2985.42" dur="4.14">traditionally E-liquid Market where</text><text start="2987.16" dur="4.679">there&apos;s not a lot of demand because uh</text><text start="2989.56" dur="4.559">it it&apos;s a single-sided market which</text><text start="2991.839" dur="3.78">honestly bonding curves will win a Nobel</text><text start="2994.119" dur="3.301">prize in economics I say this all the</text><text start="2995.619" dur="3.901">time and I because I really firmly</text><text start="2997.42" dur="4.919">believe it there&apos;s any other with any</text><text start="2999.52" dur="5.22">other system if you wanted to buy Amazon</text><text start="3002.339" dur="5.821">stock someone has to sell Amazon stock</text><text start="3004.74" dur="4.859">right if you want to uh if you if if you</text><text start="3008.16" dur="3.24">want to buy a chair someone has to sell</text><text start="3009.599" dur="3.781">a chair if you want to if you want to</text><text start="3011.4" dur="3.54">sell a glass of water someone has to buy</text><text start="3013.38" dur="4.08">your glass of water but if you want to</text><text start="3014.94" dur="4.679">sell a token on a bonding curve you just</text><text start="3017.46" dur="3.84">send it to the bonding curve no one has</text><text start="3019.619" dur="3.601">to buy it because the bonding curve</text><text start="3021.3" dur="3.42">destroys the token and releases the</text><text start="3023.22" dur="4.26">collateral it holds</text><text start="3024.72" dur="6.0">and so uh this is great for</text><text start="3027.48" dur="5.4">bootstrapping micro economies and the</text><text start="3030.72" dur="5.16">augmented bonding curve is a funding</text><text start="3032.88" dur="4.56">stream because you say uh not only does</text><text start="3035.88" dur="5.28">is there a bonding curve but you augment</text><text start="3037.44" dur="5.82">it in a few ways but just to cut scope</text><text start="3041.16" dur="4.919">the big way that you augmented is by</text><text start="3043.26" dur="5.099">basically fees on the on the mint and</text><text start="3046.079" dur="4.681">burn aspect of the of the bond curve so</text><text start="3048.359" dur="5.521">when someone sends money into mint a</text><text start="3050.76" dur="5.76">token uh some of the money goes to a a</text><text start="3053.88" dur="4.56">pot of funds and that is governed by</text><text start="3056.52" dur="4.62">token holders and then the rest of the</text><text start="3058.44" dur="4.56">money actually mints tokens and then if</text><text start="3061.14" dur="4.199">someone wants to sell their token they</text><text start="3063.0" dur="4.74">send it to the bonding curve the token</text><text start="3065.339" dur="4.801">is destroyed and of the money that&apos;s</text><text start="3067.74" dur="4.079">released most of it goes to the person</text><text start="3070.14" dur="4.14">who sold the token but some of it goes</text><text start="3071.819" dur="6.481">to the collected the collective common</text><text start="3074.28" dur="5.819">pool so it&apos;s super cool because uh this</text><text start="3078.3" dur="5.519">this is a continuous funding stream</text><text start="3080.099" dur="5.881">that&apos;s Market based and then uh and and</text><text start="3083.819" dur="4.02">as long as there&apos;s actually buying and</text><text start="3085.98" dur="3.96">selling going on you&apos;re going to have</text><text start="3087.839" dur="5.101">this volatility which will actually lead</text><text start="3089.94" dur="4.98">to public this funding so uh I&apos;m very</text><text start="3092.94" dur="5.34">bullish on the on the augmented bonding</text><text start="3094.92" dur="4.98">curve for bootstrapping markets</text><text start="3098.28" dur="3.24">so let me try to say it back to you just</text><text start="3099.9" dur="3.84">so that the listener hears it in two</text><text start="3101.52" dur="5.099">different speaking Styles</text><text start="3103.74" dur="6.66">um but uh basically a bonding curve is a</text><text start="3106.619" dur="7.561">way of bonding the supply of an asset to</text><text start="3110.4" dur="5.34">a uh exponential curve and also the</text><text start="3114.18" dur="3.6">price of the asset to an exponential</text><text start="3115.74" dur="4.2">curve so I can have an asset that is</text><text start="3117.78" dur="4.2">worth one dollars uh when it&apos;s first</text><text start="3119.94" dur="3.96">minted the first mint of it and then the</text><text start="3121.98" dur="4.079">price goes up X percent when there&apos;s</text><text start="3123.9" dur="3.959">demand and it&apos;s minted so it would go up</text><text start="3126.059" dur="3.3">let&apos;s say it goes up five percent oh no</text><text start="3127.859" dur="3.541">I should choose easy numbers because I&apos;m</text><text start="3129.359" dur="4.021">bad at math it goes from one dollar and</text><text start="3131.4" dur="4.14">then I have one unit of buy pressure and</text><text start="3133.38" dur="5.219">then it goes one mint and then it goes</text><text start="3135.54" dur="5.34">up 10 to a dollar ten and then on the</text><text start="3138.599" dur="5.281">next minute it&apos;ll go up another 10 to a</text><text start="3140.88" dur="4.62">dollar uh 21 oh God I&apos;m going to hang</text><text start="3143.88" dur="3.84">myself with this math really cool really</text><text start="3145.5" dur="4.02">quickly yeah um but okay so let&apos;s let&apos;s</text><text start="3147.72" dur="4.8">conveniently invent that there&apos;s one</text><text start="3149.52" dur="4.7">unit of cell pressure and uh then when</text><text start="3152.52" dur="3.66">that that</text><text start="3154.22" dur="5.44">then that when that cell pressure</text><text start="3156.18" dur="6.12">happens it&apos;ll go from 121 down to 110</text><text start="3159.66" dur="5.58">and that unit of Supply will be burned</text><text start="3162.3" dur="5.1">and then if another unit of Supply is</text><text start="3165.24" dur="4.26">sold onto the bonding curve then it&apos;ll</text><text start="3167.4" dur="4.86">go back down to one dollar where it</text><text start="3169.5" dur="4.14">started so basically it&apos;s a way of of</text><text start="3172.26" dur="3.72">sort of creating an exponential price</text><text start="3173.64" dur="3.9">curve in which an asset can be issued on</text><text start="3175.98" dur="4.32">a primary Market</text><text start="3177.54" dur="5.64">um and and and bonding that price and</text><text start="3180.3" dur="4.799">the supply to that exponential curve and</text><text start="3183.18" dur="3.48">this is actually a mechanism that when</text><text start="3185.099" dur="3.96">Austin and Griffith and I were coding up</text><text start="3186.66" dur="4.199">moonshot Bots uh which was an nft to</text><text start="3189.059" dur="4.981">show that you support public goods it</text><text start="3190.859" dur="5.7">would actually push up the price from uh</text><text start="3194.04" dur="4.26">I forget exactly the mechanism but I</text><text start="3196.559" dur="4.441">think that the last moonshot bot sold</text><text start="3198.3" dur="5.46">for like something like 35 eth which was</text><text start="3201.0" dur="4.619">like 100k in the most recent bear market</text><text start="3203.76" dur="4.14">so or starting the most recent bull</text><text start="3205.619" dur="3.541">market so I&apos;ve seen I attest I&apos;ll put my</text><text start="3207.9" dur="2.58">hand to this guy I&apos;ve seen the power of</text><text start="3209.16" dur="2.58">bonding curves</text><text start="3210.48" dur="4.139">um I don&apos;t know about the Nobel Prize</text><text start="3211.74" dur="4.5">thing that&apos;s your call but uh if if it</text><text start="3214.619" dur="3.321">does then you&apos;ll be able to point back</text><text start="3216.24" dur="4.74">at this and say I Told You So</text><text start="3217.94" dur="6.04">single-sided markets man it deserves a</text><text start="3220.98" dur="6.06">Nobel Prize but uh but yeah single-sided</text><text start="3223.98" dur="4.92">markets yeah it&apos;s incredible right every</text><text start="3227.04" dur="4.26">other time you need a buyer or a seller</text><text start="3228.9" dur="4.74">here you just you can just uh sell it</text><text start="3231.3" dur="5.16">this liquidity and and accurate price</text><text start="3233.64" dur="4.86">Discovery in the local markets but I</text><text start="3236.46" dur="3.84">actually I&apos;m ready to move on though I&apos;m</text><text start="3238.5" dur="3.9">very curious about dominance Assurance</text><text start="3240.3" dur="4.14">contracts I see this on our list I&apos;ve</text><text start="3242.4" dur="4.199">never heard of it before Oh man let&apos;s</text><text start="3244.44" dur="4.56">get weird all right so let&apos;s start with</text><text start="3246.599" dur="4.561">Assurance contracts Assurance contracts</text><text start="3249.0" dur="3.9">are just basically a way of saying I</text><text start="3251.16" dur="3.24">want to fund this project but I only</text><text start="3252.9" dur="3.06">want to fund it if other people want to</text><text start="3254.4" dur="3.36">fund it so it&apos;s basically a group</text><text start="3255.96" dur="6.78">coordination mechanism where you can say</text><text start="3257.76" dur="7.799">within X weeks if project y reaches uh Z</text><text start="3262.74" dur="4.44">threshold then all of the funds in this</text><text start="3265.559" dur="4.56">project will be transferred to the</text><text start="3267.18" dur="6.419">project owner and if it does not reach</text><text start="3270.119" dur="5.581">that threshold within X weeks then all</text><text start="3273.599" dur="4.02">of the money will be be returned to the</text><text start="3275.7" dur="3.899">funder so that&apos;s an assurance contract</text><text start="3277.619" dur="3.661">it basically says yo I&apos;m down to fund</text><text start="3279.599" dur="3.601">this if you all are that&apos;s all an</text><text start="3281.28" dur="4.92">insurance contract is I&apos;ll do it if you</text><text start="3283.2" dur="4.56">guys do it what&apos;s that like Kickstarter</text><text start="3286.2" dur="3.3">like Kickstarter I should have just said</text><text start="3287.76" dur="3.18">that okay cool this is why it&apos;s good to</text><text start="3289.5" dur="3.9">have ping pong back and forth between us</text><text start="3290.94" dur="4.74">a dominance insurance contract creates</text><text start="3293.4" dur="5.159">another category of funder that is the</text><text start="3295.68" dur="5.1">dominant uh funder of that and basically</text><text start="3298.559" dur="4.441">I could go to you and I could say hey</text><text start="3300.78" dur="3.6">I&apos;ll fund this if you do but a dominance</text><text start="3303.0" dur="2.819">Assurance contract what it does is it</text><text start="3304.38" dur="3.9">allows me to go to you and say hey Griff</text><text start="3305.819" dur="4.441">I believe in this so much that I&apos;m</text><text start="3308.28" dur="5.88">organizing the funding round and I&apos;m</text><text start="3310.26" dur="7.079">putting in uh like 15 of the capital and</text><text start="3314.16" dur="6.24">the way the mechanism works is that</text><text start="3317.339" dur="4.381">um if the contract reaches its goal then</text><text start="3320.4" dur="5.159">the dominant</text><text start="3321.72" dur="6.48">funder will get their money back uh and</text><text start="3325.559" dur="5.04">then some before the project gets funded</text><text start="3328.2" dur="4.74">and but if if</text><text start="3330.599" dur="4.081">um if the project does not get funded</text><text start="3332.94" dur="3.179">then they lose their money and it&apos;s</text><text start="3334.68" dur="3.659">distributed to all of the secondary</text><text start="3336.119" dur="3.541">holders so it&apos;s a bay a way of like</text><text start="3338.339" dur="3.661">really putting your money where your</text><text start="3339.66" dur="4.439">mouth is and say I&apos;m all in like I&apos;m all</text><text start="3342.0" dur="3.66">chips on the table for this project</text><text start="3344.099" dur="3.061">getting funded and I&apos;m willing to go</text><text start="3345.66" dur="4.62">around and do the effort of organizing</text><text start="3347.16" dur="5.1">everyone else being uh funding it also</text><text start="3350.28" dur="4.62">so there&apos;s two layers to this assurance</text><text start="3352.26" dur="4.68">contract like Kickstarter if if within X</text><text start="3354.9" dur="4.679">weeks why project is funded at Z</text><text start="3356.94" dur="4.02">threshold then uh then the money the</text><text start="3359.579" dur="2.76">project gets funded and everyone gets</text><text start="3360.96" dur="3.42">their money back if not dominance</text><text start="3362.339" dur="4.141">insurance contract creates a stakeholder</text><text start="3364.38" dur="4.08">that is incentivized to organize the</text><text start="3366.48" dur="5.46">whole thing by their own profit motive</text><text start="3368.46" dur="5.7">and and and like uh is you can think of</text><text start="3371.94" dur="4.379">as like pool two for Assurance contracts</text><text start="3374.16" dur="3.179">like I&apos;m all in on that so do you have</text><text start="3376.319" dur="1.821">any questions about that does that make</text><text start="3377.339" dur="4.321">sense</text><text start="3378.14" dur="5.439">wow that is so cool it&apos;s such a cool</text><text start="3381.66" dur="4.199">full donation game it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="3383.579" dur="4.141">integrating a little bit of gambling a</text><text start="3385.859" dur="3.96">little bit of speculation like you know</text><text start="3387.72" dur="4.139">it&apos;s like yeah hey you know I think this</text><text start="3389.819" dur="4.561">I think this Project&apos;s gonna pass you</text><text start="3391.859" dur="4.441">know but then like if you don&apos;t like and</text><text start="3394.38" dur="3.179">tell me if I&apos;m getting this right uh so</text><text start="3396.3" dur="2.519">if you&apos;re like I think this Project&apos;s</text><text start="3397.559" dur="3.841">gonna pass I&apos;m gonna be the largest</text><text start="3398.819" dur="4.681">funder you know and so you you try to</text><text start="3401.4" dur="4.08">one-up everybody and fund more than the</text><text start="3403.5" dur="5.22">other person but if you don&apos;t think the</text><text start="3405.48" dur="5.339">Project&apos;s gonna pass you actually also</text><text start="3408.72" dur="3.599">kind of want to put money in right</text><text start="3410.819" dur="3.421">because you&apos;re like well I don&apos;t think</text><text start="3412.319" dur="4.981">this is going to pass but yeah but then</text><text start="3414.24" dur="4.44">you put some money in but like uh

not a lot of action in</text><text start="3567.599" dur="6.421">them uh I&apos;m thinking like give power ve</text><text start="3570.72" dur="5.879">curve v e vowel and maybe one day ve uh</text><text start="3574.02" dur="5.339">GTC it&apos;s like this vote escrow right so</text><text start="3576.599" dur="6.421">it&apos;s how do we distribute</text><text start="3579.359" dur="6.24">um a streaming reward to something uh</text><text start="3583.02" dur="5.64">the ve curve ve Bell these are really</text><text start="3585.599" dur="5.641">built to distribute rewards to liquidity</text><text start="3588.66" dur="4.32">providers that are willing to like uh</text><text start="3591.24" dur="4.559">either put their money in curve or in</text><text start="3592.98" dur="5.4">balancer but give power we&apos;re using it</text><text start="3595.799" dur="5.941">to actually distribute rewards to donors</text><text start="3598.38" dur="6.719">so uh anyone you can stake and lot give</text><text start="3601.74" dur="5.52">tokens behind a project and then uh the</text><text start="3605.099" dur="4.98">the more give tokens that are locked</text><text start="3607.26" dur="4.92">behind that project the more uh give</text><text start="3610.079" dur="4.02">backs go to the donors of the project so</text><text start="3612.18" dur="3.72">give back to this mechanism we didn&apos;t</text><text start="3614.099" dur="4.681">actually add it in here as a mechanism</text><text start="3615.9" dur="5.88">but one people donate to projects on</text><text start="3618.78" dur="5.22">giveth they get they get the web 3 tax</text><text start="3621.78" dur="4.74">deduction which is give tokens and so</text><text start="3624.0" dur="3.9">like like for instance uh the the the</text><text start="3626.52" dur="3.42">the</text><text start="3627.9" dur="3.959">um the funding pool the oh man the</text><text start="3629.94" dur="3.6">matching pool that gitcoin has is</text><text start="3631.859" dur="3.841">actually on giveth so if you wanted to</text><text start="3633.54" dur="3.9">fund get coins matching pool the best</text><text start="3635.7" dur="3.419">place to do is on giveth because if you</text><text start="3637.44" dur="3.08">send money on giveth then you&apos;ll</text><text start="3639.119" dur="3.781">actually get give tokens in return</text><text start="3640.52" dur="4.96">subsidizing your donation and with give</text><text start="3642.9" dur="4.199">power that amount of give tokens that</text><text start="3645.48" dur="3.54">are given back to people is actually</text><text start="3647.099" dur="4.381">modulated by the amount of give token</text><text start="3649.02" dur="4.38">staked behind the project and and</text><text start="3651.48" dur="4.98">unfortunate the problem with this is</text><text start="3653.4" dur="5.1">that it&apos;s very clear plutocratic</text><text start="3656.46" dur="3.48">so if I say this back to you it seems</text><text start="3658.5" dur="2.7">like if I give to the get coin grants</text><text start="3659.94" dur="2.52">matching pool which by the way there</text><text start="3661.2" dur="3.599">will be a link in the show notes if</text><text start="3662.46" dur="4.98">anyone wants to get their give back</text><text start="3664.799" dur="5.401">um the uh basically if I give n dollars</text><text start="3667.44" dur="4.56">then I&apos;ll get M dollars worth of give</text><text start="3670.2" dur="4.919">backs and gives tokens and basically</text><text start="3672.0" dur="4.98">it&apos;s a way of rewarding people for</text><text start="3675.119" dur="3.841">um funding things with by creating a</text><text start="3676.98" dur="4.079">sort of distribution of governance</text><text start="3678.96" dur="4.139">of giveth</text><text start="3681.059" dur="4.681">um and so basically it&apos;s a it&apos;s a it&apos;s a</text><text start="3683.099" dur="4.98">way of allocating the ownership slash</text><text start="3685.74" dur="4.2">governance of giveth</text><text start="3688.079" dur="3.48">um and at the same time incentivizing</text><text start="3689.94" dur="3.54">more people to use giveth thus</text><text start="3691.559" dur="4.141">bootstrapping the network effects of</text><text start="3693.48" dur="3.96">giveth is that right exactly it&apos;s like</text><text start="3695.7" dur="4.02">donation mining you know instead of</text><text start="3697.44" dur="4.679">giving mining rewards to people who are</text><text start="3699.72" dur="5.579">you know solving like proof of work</text><text start="3702.119" dur="5.821">schemes uh here we&apos;re giving mining</text><text start="3705.299" dur="4.32">rewards to uh donors</text><text start="3707.94" dur="3.54">I love that</text><text start="3709.619" dur="5.22">um donation mining is a meme that you</text><text start="3711.48" dur="5.28">should create I I think that for for all</text><text start="3714.839" dur="3.601">the yield Farmers that were around in D5</text><text start="3716.76" dur="4.44">summer donation mining I think is a</text><text start="3718.44" dur="5.06">really interesting idea yeah I&apos;ll I&apos;ll</text><text start="3721.2" dur="4.859">I&apos;ll I&apos;ll add that to our meme parties</text><text start="3723.5" dur="4.059">yeah I</text><text start="3726.059" dur="4.381">um let&apos;s let&apos;s keep going what&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="3727.559" dur="4.74">budget what&apos;s budget box budget box is a</text><text start="3730.44" dur="4.139">really cool concept that came some came</text><text start="3732.299" dur="5.341">from some gig of brains from uh The</text><text start="3734.579" dur="4.98">Colony ecosystem and uh it was actually</text><text start="3737.64" dur="5.04">they wrote a really beautiful paper in</text><text start="3739.559" dur="5.881">2018 and it&apos;s basically a pairwise</text><text start="3742.68" dur="4.619">assessment so think of like Tinder or</text><text start="3745.44" dur="4.619">Hot or Not except instead of having to</text><text start="3747.299" dur="5.161">swipe right or left it&apos;s really compared</text><text start="3750.059" dur="4.141">do you like this get coin project or or</text><text start="3752.46" dur="3.359">this get congruent or that get coin</text><text start="3754.2" dur="4.5">Grant you know and you just have to pick</text><text start="3755.819" dur="4.98">one or the other and so uh I I really</text><text start="3758.7" dur="5.399">like budget box because it&apos;s a it&apos;s</text><text start="3760.799" dur="5.941">effectively a a really easy ux voting</text><text start="3764.099" dur="4.801">methodology so you can you can just say</text><text start="3766.74" dur="4.14">you can start ranking the projects but</text><text start="3768.9" dur="4.08">it&apos;s really fun it&apos;s it&apos;s a really good</text><text start="3770.88" dur="5.16">way to give qualitative assessments</text><text start="3772.98" dur="4.8">which is naturally really hard and</text><text start="3776.04" dur="3.84">distribute it in a fun

dur="3.0">building a more regenerative web but I</text><text start="4003.68" dur="3.06">don&apos;t know all right what&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="4004.52" dur="4.26">futuriki let&apos;s get into it man I don&apos;t</text><text start="4006.74" dur="5.28">know futurarchy that well honestly but</text><text start="4008.78" dur="5.4">it&apos;s basically voting on on uh kind of</text><text start="4012.02" dur="4.98">like impact Mark effect of altruism</text><text start="4014.18" dur="4.74">where you&apos;re making a bet that this that</text><text start="4017.0" dur="4.02">the future will end up a certain way and</text><text start="4018.92" dur="4.919">that this proposal will actually have a</text><text start="4021.02" dur="5.579">huge impact and you get rewarded if they</text><text start="4023.839" dur="6.541">do so it&apos;s kind of like including the</text><text start="4026.599" dur="6.48">the impact of the of the proposal uh on</text><text start="4030.38" dur="5.64">the economy or on whatever you&apos;re voting</text><text start="4033.079" dur="4.381">in with with your choice to vote yes or</text><text start="4036.02" dur="3.18">no on it so if you supported it you</text><text start="4037.46" dur="3.96">would get rewarded if it had a huge</text><text start="4039.2" dur="3.899">impact uh but you wouldn&apos;t if it didn&apos;t</text><text start="4041.42" dur="5.58">so it&apos;s kind of like bringing voters</text><text start="4043.099" dur="4.561">into the the uh prediction Market</text><text start="4047.0" dur="2.16">um</text><text start="4047.66" dur="3.24">well we could do a whole another episode</text><text start="4049.16" dur="4.56">on my prediction markets are powerful</text><text start="4050.9" dur="3.36">but it seems like basically</text><text start="4053.72" dur="3.3">um</text><text start="4054.26" dur="4.68">uh you basically kind of like bet on an</text><text start="4057.02" dur="5.88">outcome that you want to see and that</text><text start="4058.94" dur="6.3">creates a reflexive uh incentive to make</text><text start="4062.9" dur="3.959">sure that that outcome actually actually</text><text start="4065.24" dur="3.839">happens so it like creates the</text><text start="4066.859" dur="4.321">coordination incentive uh am I getting</text><text start="4069.079" dur="3.841">that right at all I think so but</text><text start="4071.18" dur="4.619">honestly it&apos;s been I haven&apos;t looked at</text><text start="4072.92" dur="4.32">futurarchy since 2018 2019 when people</text><text start="4075.799" dur="3.181">were developing on it but prediction</text><text start="4077.24" dur="5.339">markets in web 3 never really took off</text><text start="4078.98" dur="5.28">so so according to Wikipedia which is</text><text start="4082.579" dur="3.181">our primary source of this podcast Just</text><text start="4084.26" dur="2.76">for future Arc the rest of them we know</text><text start="4085.76" dur="4.079">future Arc is a form of government</text><text start="4087.02" dur="4.68">government proposed by Economist Robin</text><text start="4089.839" dur="3.541">Hansen I like Robin Hansen in which</text><text start="4091.7" dur="3.0">elected officials Define measures of</text><text start="4093.38" dur="3.24">national well-being and prediction</text><text start="4094.7" dur="3.659">markets are used to determine which</text><text start="4096.62" dur="3.54">policies will have the most positive</text><text start="4098.359" dur="3.121">effects so basically if you bet on the</text><text start="4100.16" dur="3.72">right horse if you bet on the right</text><text start="4101.48" dur="4.199">policy and that is the one that turns</text><text start="4103.88" dur="3.839">out like you&apos;re basically using markets</text><text start="4105.679" dur="3.241">to sort through which policies are going</text><text start="4107.719" dur="2.881">to create the metric of national</text><text start="4108.92" dur="3.06">well-being feels like this is powerful</text><text start="4110.6" dur="3.06">because it leverages the power of</text><text start="4111.98" dur="4.5">markets but</text><text start="4113.66" dur="5.28">um also if like what&apos;s the whole thing</text><text start="4116.48" dur="4.14">about like it once a measure becomes a</text><text start="4118.94" dur="4.14">Target it ceases to be a good measure</text><text start="4120.62" dur="5.219">that feels like a little bit applicable</text><text start="4123.08" dur="5.04">here yeah totally these metrics are so</text><text start="4125.839" dur="4.141">tough you know increasing GDP go it</text><text start="4128.12" dur="3.3">works really well if you have a war you</text><text start="4129.98" dur="3.42">know and destroy all the buildings yeah</text><text start="4131.42" dur="3.72">there&apos;s a lot of then there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="4133.4" dur="3.18">things to build right well it&apos;s also</text><text start="4135.14" dur="3.3">like how do you measure National</text><text start="4136.58" dur="3.179">happiness you know like you said it&apos;s</text><text start="4138.44" dur="5.1">hard to</text><text start="4139.759" dur="4.801">quantify happiness so you know if you&apos;re</text><text start="4143.54" dur="2.58">going to do it on things that we</text><text start="4144.56" dur="3.92">actually want to measure then those</text><text start="4146.12" dur="6.139">things often aren&apos;t quantifiable yeah</text><text start="4148.48" dur="5.46">yeah what&apos;s what&apos;s stigmergy</text><text start="4152.259" dur="5.44">yeah</text><text start="4153.94" dur="5.44">uh is basically the it&apos;s a mechanism of</text><text start="4157.699" dur="4.14">indirect coordination through which</text><text start="4159.38" dur="5.64">through the environment between agents</text><text start="4161.839" dur="4.98">or actions so basically the principle is</text><text start="4165.02" dur="3.839">that a trace left in the environment by</text><text start="4166.819" dur="4.44">an individual action stimulates the</text><text start="4168.859" dur="4.5">performance of a succeeding action by</text><text start="4171.259" dur="4.02">the same or different agents this is by</text><text start="4173.359" dur="4.021">the way how ants coordinate</text><text start="4175.279" dur="3.48">um they don&apos;t have Wi-Fi between each</text><text start="4177.38" dur="2.58">other it&apos;d be cool if they did but like</text><text start="4178.759" dur="3.841">they basically have to leave these</text><text start="4179.96" dur="4.62">pheromones in which tell the other ants</text><text start="4182.6" dur="4.139">go over here there&apos;s food here or the</text><text start="4184.58" dur="4.5">nest is back this way so they&apos;re leaving</text><text start="4186.739" dur="3.661">these stigmergic Trails the more ants</text><text start="4189.08" dur="3.239">that go down these trails and the ones</text><text start="4190.4" dur="4.2">that really put down the more pheromones</text><text start="4192.319" dur="4.081">will lead more ants to go down in a</text><text start="4194.6" dur="4.2">certain direction so maybe this isn&apos;t</text><text start="4196.4" dur="4.98">like a collective public goods funding</text><text start="4198.8" dur="6.12">allocation ISM but I think it&apos;s an</text><text start="4201.38" dur="4.74">attribute of other mechanisms is that</text><text start="4204.92" dur="2.64">like this is actually by the way maybe</text><text start="4206.12" dur="3.96">quadratic funding is the way to connect</text><text start="4207.56" dur="4.26">this is like if you fund this grant um</text><text start="4210.08" dur="3.06">then that&apos;s a stigmergic that&apos;s the</text><text start="4211.82" dur="3.3">equivalent of like an ant pheromone that</text><text start="4213.14" dur="3.66">says go here like if I trust Griff and</text><text start="4215.12" dur="3.72">he says lays down a pheromone on this</text><text start="4216.8" dur="2.76">Bitcoin Grant then then I&apos;m gonna fund</text><text start="4218.84" dur="2.1">it</text><text start="4219.56" dur="3.54">um so maybe this is more of a property</text><text start="4220.94" dur="4.92">of the other mechanisms than a mechanism</text><text start="4223.1" dur="4.5">in itself the cart functionality that</text><text start="4225.86" dur="3.12">you had when you could share a cart very</text><text start="4227.6" dur="3.72">stickmergic</text><text start="4228.98" dur="4.44">yeah yeah</text><text start="4231.32" dur="3.48">um so what I think is interesting is</text><text start="4233.42" dur="3.0">like the reflexivity of some of these</text><text start="4234.8" dur="3.78">things where One agent doing an action</text><text start="4236.42" dur="3.72">causes other agents to follow down that</text><text start="4238.58" dur="3.84">action and if you can create a web of</text><text start="4240.14" dur="3.84">trust that says hey these are the people</text><text start="4242.42" dur="4.5">that</text><text start="4243.98" dur="4.44">um have high credibility and they get</text><text start="4246.92" dur="3.6">more credibility the more good stuff</text><text start="4248.42" dur="3.66">they do and they lose credibility the</text><text start="4250.52" dur="4.08">worst stuff they do like there&apos;s kind of</text><text start="4252.08" dur="4.56">a reflexive stickmergic attribute to a</text><text start="4254.6" dur="4.02">lot of these mechanisms which is cool</text><text start="4256.64" dur="4.5">yeah all right we&apos;ve gone to overtime on</text><text start="4258.62" dur="4.68">Sigma G tell me about praise yeah praise</text><text start="4261.14" dur="4.62">is so cool I I love crazy because it it</text><text start="4263.3" dur="5.16">it&apos;s a kind of a reward system slash</text><text start="4265.76" dur="4.919">reputation system where uh it&apos;s very</text><text start="4268.46" dur="4.92">bottom up and peer-to-peer collaborative</text><text start="4270.679" dur="4.141">uh so you might have like a collective</text><text start="4273.38" dur="3.96">pot where you say hey we&apos;re gonna give</text><text start="4274.82" dur="4.5">away you know two thousand dollars to</text><text start="4277.34" dur="4.68">the people who are praised every two</text><text start="4279.32" dur="4.859">weeks and uh praise is super simple it&apos;s</text><text start="4282.02" dur="4.8">just a Discord bot where you say I</text><text start="4284.179" dur="4.741">praise Kevin owaki for this thing for</text><text start="4286.82" dur="3.78">the incredible podcast that he runs</text><text start="4288.92" dur="4.2">green pill is an inspiration to the</text><text start="4290.6" dur="5.579">regen movement right and uh and then</text><text start="4293.12" dur="5.579">those Praises just kind of build up and</text><text start="4296.179" dur="4.321">you could just just use it as a way to</text><text start="4298.699" dur="3.121">inspire a culture of gratitude you don&apos;t</text><text start="4300.5" dur="3.0">have to do anything further from that</text><text start="4301.82" dur="3.78">because I feel like in the digital space</text><text start="4303.5" dur="3.36">that&apos;s missing a lot but where it</text><text start="4305.6" dur="3.18">becomes a collective allocation</text><text start="4306.86" dur="4.859">mechanism is in the quantification</text><text start="4308.78" dur="4.86">aspect so this is this is addressing</text><text start="4311.719" dur="5.94">this problem how do we how do we</text><text start="4313.64" dur="6.9">quantify qualitative value creation and</text><text start="4317.659" dur="4.461">uh the best way is human signaling you</text><text start="4320.54" dur="5.28">know humans being the the the</text><text start="4322.12" dur="6.52">Transformer so uh at the end of a</text><text start="4325.82" dur="4.2">two-week period uh the quantifiers will</text><text start="4328.64" dur="3.36">step up and they&apos;ll be rewarded for</text><text start="4330.02" dur="3.84">quantifying and they&apos;ll say hey uh</text><text start="4332.0" dur="4.56">they&apos;ll they&apos;ll give a score to each</text><text start="4333.86" dur="5.22">praise and then each qualitative uh</text><text start="4336.56" dur="4.56">input of Praise of gratitude right</text><text start="4339.08" dur="4.8">actually ends up with a token allocation</text><text start="4341.12" dur="4.86">based off of these scores and so you can</text><text start="4343.88" dur="3.54">kind of have this like repeatable thing</text><text start="4345.98" dur="3.84">but there&apos;s so many cool second order</text><text start="4347.42" dur="4.56">effects the Gratitude component and just</text><text start="4349.82" dur="4.379">the higher Vibes and then of course like</text><text start="4351.98" dur="4.56">you end up with the quantifiers getting</text><text start="4354.199" dur="4.381">kind of an overview of a lot of things</text><text start="4356.54" dur="3.659">that are happening in the community and</text><text start="4358.58" dur="3.84">the coolest thing though is you get all</text><text start="4360.199" dur="4.321">this data you get all this very rich</text><text start="4362.42" dur="4.2">data that you could effectively use</text><text start="4364.52" dur="4.92">machine learning techniques to uh to</text><text start="4366.62" dur="4.44">take that data and use it so to inspire</text><text start="4369.44" dur="4.08">the community or inform the community</text><text start="4371.06" dur="4.92">about who&apos;s doing what and and this sort</text><text start="4373.52" dur="5.52">of thing so it&apos;s going to be super cool</text><text start="4375.98" dur="4.44">hmm I I feel like it I feel compelled to</text><text start="4379.04" dur="3.6">mention coordinate here because I know</text><text start="4380.42" dur="4.56">that they&apos;re doing giving circles at</text><text start="4382.64" dur="4.559">scale in token allocations based off of</text><text start="4384.98" dur="3.48">them and so I just feel compelled to</text><text start="4387.199" dur="3.54">mention them because they&apos;re a prominent</text><text start="4388.46" dur="3.9">uh part of I mean how would you compare</text><text start="4390.739" dur="4.261">and contrast the way coordinate works</text><text start="4392.36" dur="4.74">with with praise coordinate is really</text><text start="4395.0" dur="4.159">cool because it&apos;s uh it&apos;s the same kind</text><text start="4397.1" dur="5.28">of human signaling qualitative</text><text start="4399.159" dur="5.381">qualitative input uh where people are</text><text start="4402.38" dur="3.96">Distributing things uh but and it but</text><text start="4404.54" dur="3.24">it&apos;s and it&apos;s lower effort in many ways</text><text start="4406.34" dur="3.899">because it just happens once a month</text><text start="4407.78" dur="3.66">right and people are Distributing the</text><text start="4410.239" dur="4.201">data</text><text start="4411.44" dur="5.1">um and so but uh but it&apos;s harder in some</text><text start="4414.44" dur="5.34">ways because there isn&apos;t this uh this</text><text start="4416.54" dur="5.82">reason why right like with with praise</text><text start="4419.78" dur="5.28">you get this reason why someone got some</text><text start="4422.36" dur="4.98">amount of tokens every time and with</text><text start="4425.06" dur="5.159">Courtney if it&apos;s it&apos;s uh there&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="4427.34" dur="5.04">it&apos;s way easier and and way lower effort</text><text start="4430.219" dur="4.98">but then you don&apos;t have the reason why</text><text start="4432.38" dur="4.5">you know uh so so it&apos;s but it but</text><text start="4435.199" dur="3.361">they&apos;re also great and I want to give a</text><text start="4436.88" dur="3.6">shout out to other outer space too</text><text start="4438.56" dur="4.8">they&apos;re they&apos;re another up and coming</text><text start="4440.48" dur="5.1">reputation system like reward system</text><text start="4443.36" dur="4.62">that&apos;s coming through with nfts and</text><text start="4445.58" dur="4.38">leveling up nft Badges and they&apos;re doing</text><text start="4447.98" dur="4.38">cool stuff so I think there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="4449.96" dur="4.68">action in the rewards and reputation</text><text start="4452.36" dur="4.379">system of game and thank you because we</text><text start="4454.64" dur="3.66">need it yeah I mean so there&apos;s this idea</text><text start="4456.739" dur="3.541">of the web of trust which is basically</text><text start="4458.3" dur="3.419">like it was kind of invented this is</text><text start="4460.28" dur="3.66">what page rank at Google was where</text><text start="4461.719" dur="4.561">basically Larry and Sergey realized that</text><text start="4463.94" dur="4.38">any websites linked to another website</text><text start="4466.28" dur="4.32">was an implicit vote of trust in that</text><text start="4468.32" dur="4.5">website and when you aggregate a graph</text><text start="4470.6" dur="4.8">and distribute reputation according to</text><text start="4472.82" dur="4.02">those links you can rank the web based</text><text start="4475.4" dur="3.72">off of the distributed collective</text><text start="4476.84" dur="3.96">intelligence of what the web thinks is</text><text start="4479.12" dur="4.14">valuable and you create this iterative</text><text start="4480.8" dur="4.439">sort of evolutionary game where you uh</text><text start="4483.26" dur="3.24">deliver trust in the system and I think</text><text start="4485.239" dur="3.061">it&apos;s really interesting like I see this</text><text start="4486.5" dur="4.14">with praise and with auto space and with</text><text start="4488.3" dur="5.1">coordinate in which people vote on each</text><text start="4490.64" dur="4.98">other and uh who they think is valuable</text><text start="4493.4" dur="4.38">is adding value and that creates a</text><text start="4495.62" dur="4.2">similar web of trust type model and now</text><text start="4497.78" dur="4.379">we can drop tokens on top of the web of</text><text start="4499.82" dur="4.919">trust which makes it even cooler</text><text start="4502.159" dur="3.961">um and and so um</text><text start="4504.739" dur="2.701">I want to connect that to another video</text><text start="4506.12" dur="3.72">but I&apos;m curious if you have thoughts on</text><text start="4507.44" dur="3.84">web of trust before I do I love I love</text><text start="4509.84" dur="4.02">the web address model I feel like it</text><text start="4511.28" dur="5.28">there&apos;s like trust lines and bright ID</text><text start="4513.86" dur="4.799">and there and circles are all using that</text><text start="4516.56" dur="6.06">too and and I feel like they&apos;re a whole</text><text start="4518.659" dur="6.181">nother uh form of uh of in some ways</text><text start="4522.62" dur="4.02">what we&apos;re talking about or collected</text><text start="4524.84" dur="4.02">using collective intelligence to</text><text start="4526.64" dur="3.48">reallocate resources that we totally</text><text start="4528.86" dur="3.0">missed</text><text start="4530.12" dur="3.78">you can you can create simple resistance</text><text start="4531.86" dur="4.02">with that too and listeners know that</text><text start="4533.9" dur="3.36">I&apos;m obsessed with civil resistance</text><text start="4535.88" dur="3.42">um the idea that I wanted to connect</text><text start="4537.26" dur="4.32">here was this um I really feel like what</text><text start="4539.3" dur="3.96">we&apos;re doing in regen web3 is connecting</text><text start="4541.58" dur="4.68">Financial Capital to other types of</text><text start="4543.26" dur="4.56">capital in this scenario we&apos;re uh not</text><text start="4546.26" dur="3.72">only connecting Financial Capital to</text><text start="4547.82" dur="4.56">Social and cultural capital but we&apos;re</text><text start="4549.98" dur="4.679">making the financial Capital subservient</text><text start="4552.38" dur="3.54">to our social and cultural capital as</text><text start="4554.659" dur="3.54">opposed to the Social and cultural</text><text start="4555.92" dur="4.62">capital uh being subservient to the</text><text start="4558.199" dur="3.96">financial capital and so there&apos;s this</text><text start="4560.54" dur="2.76">there&apos;s this idea from Gregory landua</text><text start="4562.159" dur="2.761">the founder of region Network that</text><text start="4563.3" dur="3.48">there&apos;s eight types of capital Social</text><text start="4564.92" dur="4.02">Capital material Financial living</text><text start="4566.78" dur="4.14">intellectual this podcast is a form of</text><text start="4568.94" dur="3.54">intellectual Capital spiritual capital</text><text start="4570.92" dur="3.54">and cultural capital what would it mean</text><text start="4572.48" dur="4.32">to build a financial system that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="4574.46" dur="4.5">extract these other type of capitals in</text><text start="4576.8" dur="5.1">order to create Financial upside but</text><text start="4578.96" dur="5.88">instead is in service of the hard to</text><text start="4581.9" dur="5.339">quantify spiritual and living in</text><text start="4584.84" dur="4.08">material Capital that uh that we were</text><text start="4587.239" dur="3.901">like this is really about inverting the</text><text start="4588.92" dur="3.62">relationship of Finance to to these</text><text start="4591.14" dur="4.559">other types of capital in my opinion</text><text start="4592.54" dur="4.96">absolutely and I think this is where</text><text start="4595.699" dur="3.661">um so many of these things that we&apos;re</text><text start="4597.5" dur="3.239">talking about are all about this how do</text><text start="4599.36" dur="4.02">we take something qualitative and</text><text start="4600.739" dur="4.321">quantify it because if we if we can get</text><text start="4603.38" dur="4.56">really good at that then all those other</text><text start="4605.06" dur="4.8">Financial caps all those other forms of</text><text start="4607.94" dur="3.96">capital can actually be integrated into</text><text start="4609.86" dur="3.0">systems that we actually that we really</text><text start="4611.9" dur="3.18">want</text><text start="4612.86" dur="4.2">yeah because Financial capital is great</text><text start="4615.08" dur="3.78">because it&apos;s so quantifiable it&apos;s just</text><text start="4617.06" dur="3.78">like look I made some money you know</text><text start="4618.86" dur="4.44">it&apos;s in a spreadsheet like coordination</text><text start="4620.84" dur="5.339">is easy but if we can coordinate around</text><text start="4623.3" dur="4.439">qualitative value now we have so much of</text><text start="4626.179" dur="3.661">a richer Society</text><text start="4627.739" dur="3.541">yeah</text><text start="4629.84" dur="3.359">um man as the more places I want to go</text><text start="4631.28" dur="3.6">with this but we are over time and we</text><text start="4633.199" dur="2.761">have like three more mechanisms to get</text><text start="4634.88" dur="2.339">through can you go for 10 more minutes</text><text start="4635.96" dur="3.779">and can we get through these in 10 more</text><text start="4637.219" dur="5.221">minutes definitely and this these two</text><text start="4639.739" dur="4.201">will be short so demorage uh demaraj is</text><text start="4642.44" dur="4.32">is the next one and it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="4643.94" dur="5.64">inflation it&apos;s except the opposite so</text><text start="4646.76" dur="4.32">you think of inflation where uh you you</text><text start="4649.58" dur="4.02">could even say like Bitcoin uses</text><text start="4651.08" dur="4.92">inflation to fund its public good which</text><text start="4653.6" dur="4.74">is a you know a secure blockchain for</text><text start="4656.0" dur="4.56">Value transfer anywhere anyone in the</text><text start="4658.34" dur="4.68">world can create an address uh anywhere</text><text start="4660.56" dur="4.86">else in the world uh and and receive</text><text start="4663.02" dur="4.74">money which itself international access</text><text start="4665.42" dur="6.18">to an International Financial system is</text><text start="4667.76" dur="6.66">a public good uh so then uh they use</text><text start="4671.6" dur="5.639">inflation to do it but demaraj is saying</text><text start="4674.42" dur="6.36">uh actually this money is becoming less</text><text start="4677.239" dur="5.521">valuable uh over time and so uh if you</text><text start="4680.78" dur="3.899">if you thought if Bitcoin were to be</text><text start="4682.76" dur="5.34">funded by inflation what it actually do</text><text start="4684.679" dur="5.52">is say oh hey Bitcoin holder uh your a</text><text start="4688.1" dur="4.86">fraction of your your big coin that you</text><text start="4690.199" dur="6.0">have one Bitcoin well in six months it&apos;s</text><text start="4692.96" dur="5.64">going to be 0.99 Bitcoin and that other</text><text start="4696.199" dur="4.741">0.1 Bitcoin went to a common pool of</text><text start="4698.6" dur="5.28">funds and so it kind of it&apos;s supposed to</text><text start="4700.94" dur="4.86">inspire the the velocity of money and</text><text start="4703.88" dur="4.92">it&apos;s really it I mean it was used way</text><text start="4705.8" dur="5.7">back in the day to really model after</text><text start="4708.8" dur="6.419">um scarce resources that degraded like</text><text start="4711.5" dur="6.719">rice or flour and so like the the church</text><text start="4715.219" dur="5.761">would create a a church would create a a</text><text start="4718.219" dur="5.401">stamp that would would say well guess</text><text start="4720.98" dur="4.44">what this rice is rotting so this is</text><text start="4723.62" dur="4.02">this is valuable this is worth one bag</text><text start="4725.42" dur="4.44">of rice but you know the bag gets</text><text start="4727.64" dur="3.78">smaller as time goes on because the rice</text><text start="4729.86" dur="4.08">that&apos;s sitting there backing it is</text><text start="4731.42" dur="5.04">degrading and and so that&apos;s what Den Raj</text><text start="4733.94" dur="4.739">is modeled after and but honestly what</text><text start="4736.46" dur="4.56">I&apos;ve seen is that these systems this</text><text start="4738.679" dur="4.261">demurrage has bad ux I don&apos;t think it&apos;s</text><text start="4741.02" dur="4.02">a working a good working system I&apos;ve</text><text start="4742.94" dur="4.32">never seen someone use demorage</text><text start="4745.04" dur="4.5">successfully uh there are lots of people</text><text start="4747.26" dur="4.32">who have tried but I think that there is</text><text start="4749.54" dur="5.1">in this human nature that we don&apos;t want</text><text start="4751.58" dur="6.06">things taken from us you know so like</text><text start="4754.64" dur="4.92">having one Bitcoin turned to 0.99 is</text><text start="4757.64" dur="3.3">like yeah what the hell</text><text start="4759.56" dur="2.82">well let me ask you this how is this</text><text start="4760.94" dur="2.82">different from taxes I guess it&apos;s kind</text><text start="4762.38" dur="2.819">of like a wealth tax it&apos;s not based off</text><text start="4763.76" dur="2.459">of your income it&apos;s based off of your</text><text start="4765.199" dur="4.261">Holdings</text><text start="4766.219" dur="4.681">yes exactly so it&apos;s it&apos;s so it&apos;s very</text><text start="4769.46" dur="3.3">similar to</text><text start="4770.9" dur="4.14">um well yeah it&apos;s not on income it&apos;s</text><text start="4772.76" dur="4.2">it&apos;s based off folded so it&apos;s like hey</text><text start="4775.04" dur="3.119">you&apos;re you&apos;re you have 10 million</text><text start="4776.96" dur="4.259">dollars well</text><text start="4778.159" dur="5.281">you know now you have less what but the</text><text start="4781.219" dur="6.421">but the funny thing is inflation is the</text><text start="4783.44" dur="6.44">exact same uh mechanism yeah but just</text><text start="4787.64" dur="5.4">your unit of account is debased yeah</text><text start="4789.88" dur="7.12">exactly it has inflation has the exact</text><text start="4793.04" dur="6.72">same uh patter the exact same result but</text><text start="4797.0" dur="4.02">the you user experience doesn&apos;t feel bad</text><text start="4799.76" dur="3.0">yeah</text><text start="4801.02" dur="4.32">yeah it feels like I got more Rich</text><text start="4802.76" dur="4.02">because I&apos;m getting higher yeah all</text><text start="4805.34" dur="3.6">right I&apos;m gonna Channel my inner Eric</text><text start="4806.78" dur="4.379">Voorhees or my interlibertarian and say</text><text start="4808.94" dur="4.2">taxation is theft in demorages probably</text><text start="4811.159" dur="4.981">theft and so absolutely we should move</text><text start="4813.14" dur="4.559">on um tell me about proposer inverter uh</text><text start="4816.14" dur="4.14">yeah the proposal is very super cool</text><text start="4817.699" dur="5.52">it&apos;s basically like imagine a git coin</text><text start="4820.28" dur="5.82">Grant with with a a</text><text start="4823.219" dur="7.381">you know a cap like it has a funding</text><text start="4826.1" dur="6.36">goal and and then uh if it if anyone can</text><text start="4830.6" dur="4.079">fund it which is nice because most</text><text start="4832.46" dur="6.84">proposals you have to create a proposal</text><text start="4834.679" dur="6.661">to One Dao right uh and you hope it gets</text><text start="4839.3" dur="4.68">funded and it&apos;s kind of a binary yes or</text><text start="4841.34" dur="5.339">no but with this uh you can make one</text><text start="4843.98" dur="5.759">proposal and lots of dows or individuals</text><text start="4846.679" dur="7.381">can fund it and then uh then it&apos;s</text><text start="4849.739" dur="6.721">released to the to so to uh the party</text><text start="4854.06" dur="5.88">who made the proposal so you can imagine</text><text start="4856.46" dur="6.779">a market for proposals uh and and then</text><text start="4859.94" dur="6.299">it also has a lot of cool features like</text><text start="4863.239" dur="5.041">Milestones so maybe uh all the funders</text><text start="4866.239" dur="4.741">agreed to these milestones and they fund</text><text start="4868.28" dur="4.32">it and and once once it reaches ten</text><text start="4870.98" dur="2.94">thousand dollars then the first two</text><text start="4872.6" dur="3.48">thousand dollars will go to the project</text><text start="4873.92" dur="4.86">they have to complete some Milestone</text><text start="4876.08" dur="4.38">there&apos;s an assigned reviewer and if they</text><text start="4878.78" dur="3.24">achieve that Milestone then they get the</text><text start="4880.46" dur="3.18">next five thousand dollars right and</text><text start="4882.02" dur="3.78">then if they achieve the whole thing</text><text start="4883.64" dur="4.559">they get the last three thousand and uh</text><text start="4885.8" dur="4.379">so but what&apos;s the coolest thing is the</text><text start="4888.199" dur="4.261">inversion right the fact that lots of</text><text start="4890.179" dur="4.201">people can fund this and it&apos;s it&apos;s not a</text><text start="4892.46" dur="4.02">proposal for one doubt but you know if</text><text start="4894.38" dur="3.96">you&apos;re solving a problem that helps a</text><text start="4896.48" dur="3.719">lot of different doubts they could all</text><text start="4898.34" dur="3.3">fund it together</text><text start="4900.199" dur="3.121">um</text><text start="4901.64" dur="3.24">this kind of reminds me of have you</text><text start="4903.32" dur="4.74">heard of prop house at all</text><text start="4904.88" dur="6.18">is this the nouns thing but announcing</text><text start="4908.06" dur="5.119">yeah yeah yeah yeah it&apos;s really cool is</text><text start="4911.06" dur="5.76">that the same as proposal inverter</text><text start="4913.179" dur="4.781">no because the the let me just say what</text><text start="4916.82" dur="2.94">prop house is and we can compare and</text><text start="4917.96" dur="3.9">contrast them is that sound good yeah</text><text start="4919.76" dur="4.919">cool so prop house is the nounsdale</text><text start="4921.86" dur="6.12">funding mechanism and nouns has a</text><text start="4924.679" dur="4.921">treasury of several tens of millions of</text><text start="4927.98" dur="3.48">dollars if not hundreds of millions of</text><text start="4929.6" dur="2.76">dollars twenty nine thousand each okay</text><text start="4931.46" dur="2.64">God</text><text start="4932.36" dur="3.24">um and so they use prop house how it</text><text start="4934.1" dur="3.24">works is communities hold funding rounds</text><text start="4935.6" dur="3.0">in their Community houses in these</text><text start="4937.34" dur="3.42">funding grounds Builders can propose</text><text start="4938.6" dur="3.66">ideas to get funding the flow is as</text><text start="4940.76" dur="3.479">follows a funding round is put up by a</text><text start="4942.26" dur="3.78">community each funding round has a fixed</text><text start="4944.239" dur="3.901">amount of capital to be won and it&apos;s</text><text start="4946.04" dur="4.38">composed by a proposing in a voting</text><text start="4948.14" dur="3.84">period uh during the proposing period</text><text start="4950.42" dur="4.92">Builders can propose ideas they&apos;d like</text><text start="4951.98" dur="5.4">to get funding the proposing period ends</text><text start="4955.34" dur="3.6">after the voting period starts Community</text><text start="4957.38" dur="3.66">token holders vote on their favorite</text><text start="4958.94" dur="4.259">proposals and then the top proposals get</text><text start="4961.04" dur="4.56">funded so that it feels like some sort</text><text start="4963.199" dur="4.261">of inversion to me but I don&apos;t how do</text><text start="4965.6" dur="4.02">those differ from from your perspective</text><text start="4967.46" dur="4.08">the big difference is it&apos;s still within</text><text start="4969.62" dur="3.42">one dial right even though there&apos;s</text><text start="4971.54" dur="3.5">committees and stuff and there&apos;s still</text><text start="4973.04" dur="4.5">only one funder</text><text start="4975.04" dur="4.54">that&apos;s that&apos;s the biggest that&apos;s the</text><text start="4977.54" dur="3.679">biggest thing but I I think it stands on</text><text start="4979.58" dur="4.98">its own as a very successful mechanism</text><text start="4981.219" dur="5.861">ens uses it to they call it ANS small</text><text start="4984.56" dur="4.619">grants uh and and it and I think the</text><text start="4987.08" dur="4.02">cool thing about prop house is the user</text><text start="4989.179" dur="5.281">experience of proposing a grant is just</text><text start="4991.1" dur="5.28">so much easier you know uh these these</text><text start="4994.46" dur="2.82">debates yeah</text><text start="4996.38" dur="3.12">yeah</text><text start="4997.28" dur="4.8">uh but let&apos;s let&apos;s finish this thing off</text><text start="4999.5" dur="3.96">but with a bank it&apos;s so close I could</text><text start="5002.08" dur="3.24">see the light at the end of the tunnel</text><text start="5003.46" dur="4.32">yeah but my brain is so silly putty</text><text start="5005.32" dur="3.96">right now okay quadratic voting is</text><text start="5007.78" dur="3.419">actually so actually quadratic funding</text><text start="5009.28" dur="4.74">is a fork of quadratic voting that uses</text><text start="5011.199" dur="4.321">money instead of uh voting credits but</text><text start="5014.02" dur="2.88">we&apos;re gonna do it backwards because I&apos;m</text><text start="5015.52" dur="3.24">the get coin guy</text><text start="5016.9" dur="3.6">um or at least I was the good one guy</text><text start="5018.76" dur="4.08">um so quadratic voting is basically a</text><text start="5020.5" dur="4.98">way of not only measuring it&apos;s a it&apos;s an</text><text start="5022.84" dur="5.1">ALT on uh one human one vote voting in</text><text start="5025.48" dur="4.679">which you can measure not only the</text><text start="5027.94" dur="5.46">um preferences of a population but you</text><text start="5030.159" dur="5.341">can measure the uh strength of those</text><text start="5033.4" dur="3.54">preferences so basically I get a certain</text><text start="5035.5" dur="3.54">amount of vote credits let&apos;s call it 100</text><text start="5036.94" dur="4.739">vote credits and I get to vote on 10</text><text start="5039.04" dur="4.86">different things and the way it works is</text><text start="5041.679" dur="3.781">that the voting the votes that I can get</text><text start="5043.9" dur="4.02">are a square root of the vote credit</text><text start="5045.46" dur="6.239">that I spend on each issue so I can</text><text start="5047.92" dur="5.34">spend a hundred voting credits on um a</text><text start="5051.699" dur="3.0">bunch of diff actually let&apos;s say there&apos;s</text><text start="5053.26" dur="3.72">100 voting credits on 100 different</text><text start="5054.699" dur="5.821">issues I can spend one vote credit on</text><text start="5056.98" dur="5.34">each individual issue or I can spend 100</text><text start="5060.52" dur="4.139">voting credits to get</text><text start="5062.32" dur="4.98">10 votes on one specific issue because</text><text start="5064.659" dur="4.741">10 is the square root of 100. and so</text><text start="5067.3" dur="3.899">basically what this allows you to do is</text><text start="5069.4" dur="3.96">because there is a higher dimensional</text><text start="5071.199" dur="3.601">input into the system how many voting</text><text start="5073.36" dur="3.96">credits am I willing to spend for how</text><text start="5074.8" dur="5.52">many amount of votes you can measure not</text><text start="5077.32" dur="5.16">only the amount of uh like what</text><text start="5080.32" dur="3.839">someone&apos;s preferences are but this the</text><text start="5082.48" dur="4.14">the strength of those preferences if I</text><text start="5084.159" dur="5.161">vote for a with all 100 voting credits</text><text start="5086.62" dur="5.64">only to get 10 votes then you know that</text><text start="5089.32" dur="5.04">I really care about that whereas with</text><text start="5092.26" dur="3.72">with the if I if I spread it out then</text><text start="5094.36" dur="4.98">I&apos;ve got a bunch of small preferences</text><text start="5095.98" dur="5.1">and this isn&apos;t meant to be sort of like</text><text start="5099.34" dur="3.839">the reason why you don&apos;t do this with</text><text start="5101.08" dur="3.0">one-to-one voting credits to votes is</text><text start="5103.179" dur="2.221">that you don&apos;t want to have a</text><text start="5104.08" dur="3.78">plutocratic thing where like just the</text><text start="5105.4" dur="4.5">loudest voices can can sway any</text><text start="5107.86" dur="3.96">individual issue you want to be able to</text><text start="5109.9" dur="5.16">make it so that the broad consensus of</text><text start="5111.82" dur="6.12">the population is the ones that uh that</text><text start="5115.06" dur="5.28">can Swain issue so uh get coin uh back</text><text start="5117.94" dur="3.6">when I was there along with Anish from</text><text start="5120.34" dur="3.18">Paradigm built this tool called</text><text start="5121.54" dur="4.86">quadratic vote dot Co which is an easy</text><text start="5123.52" dur="4.56">way of holding a quadratic vote and um</text><text start="5126.4" dur="3.299">been cool to see that get some usage</text><text start="5128.08" dur="3.9">anything to say about quadratic voting</text><text start="5129.699" dur="4.581">yeah there&apos;s another implementation by</text><text start="5131.98" dur="7.14">Wesley from the ethereum foundation</text><text start="5134.28" dur="6.7">called token

different economic parameters</text><text start="5146.199" dur="5.401">actually and it it&apos;s super cool I I</text><text start="5148.239" dur="5.761">really love it because it mitigates it</text><text start="5151.6" dur="4.86">allows you to Signal preference and and</text><text start="5154.0" dur="4.56">uh makes it fun you know there&apos;s kind of</text><text start="5156.46" dur="4.8">a game it&apos;s like okay this is my</text><text start="5158.56" dur="6.42">favorite but my voice will actually be</text><text start="5161.26" dur="6.06">heard if I spread my opinion out across</text><text start="5164.98" dur="4.8">a few different ideas a few different</text><text start="5167.32" dur="5.46">proposals and then I&apos;ll have a louder</text><text start="5169.78" dur="4.68">voice the more diverse my opinion is and</text><text start="5172.78" dur="3.78">but then of course you probably have a</text><text start="5174.46" dur="4.62">favorite so it&apos;s kind of it&apos;s a it makes</text><text start="5176.56" dur="5.22">voting fun and I think uh like all of</text><text start="5179.08" dur="4.68">these mechanisms I they I think the ones</text><text start="5181.78" dur="5.22">that make things is fun are the ones</text><text start="5183.76" dur="4.919">that will win uh yeah and or be used the</text><text start="5187.0" dur="5.639">most I mean there&apos;s no winning or losing</text><text start="5188.679" dur="6.241">here but uh yeah so I I I I think that</text><text start="5192.639" dur="4.621">quadratic voting has a lot of legs and I</text><text start="5194.92" dur="5.819">actually saw Glenn Wall come out with a</text><text start="5197.26" dur="6.36">a a paper maybe a year ago about how to</text><text start="5200.739" dur="5.46">integrate negative voting in uh where</text><text start="5203.62" dur="4.559">like you can also uh because with</text><text start="5206.199" dur="3.841">quadratic voting it&apos;s it&apos;s all upvoting</text><text start="5208.179" dur="4.081">traditionally like there&apos;s no there&apos;s no</text><text start="5210.04" dur="4.8">no votes which is also nice actually I</text><text start="5212.26" dur="4.379">really like that but uh I think he</text><text start="5214.84" dur="6.42">integrated a way where you could also</text><text start="5216.639" dur="6.901">say no uh for bad proposals and uh but</text><text start="5221.26" dur="5.22">it would cost even more than saying yes</text><text start="5223.54" dur="5.159">uh like my scale at a larger rate I</text><text start="5226.48" dur="4.14">forget exactly the mechanism but because</text><text start="5228.699" dur="3.48">it&apos;s in an academic paper you know but</text><text start="5230.62" dur="3.24">it&apos;s still really interesting I mean I</text><text start="5232.179" dur="4.081">feel like all of these things were still</text><text start="5233.86" dur="4.44">like really innovating and trying to</text><text start="5236.26" dur="4.379">figure them out and the mechanism design</text><text start="5238.3" dur="4.02">opportunities are huge</text><text start="5240.639" dur="2.701">so I hate to do this to you but I&apos;m</text><text start="5242.32" dur="2.819">going to rug you and add one more</text><text start="5243.34" dur="3.6">mechanism to the event or to the list</text><text start="5245.139" dur="3.241">and that&apos;s based off of the Insight that</text><text start="5246.94" dur="3.66">you have that the best mechanisms here</text><text start="5248.38" dur="5.1">are going to feel fun so I&apos;m adding joke</text><text start="5250.6" dur="4.5">race to the list which is basically a</text><text start="5253.48" dur="3.6">Bottoms Up on-chain governance for</text><text start="5255.1" dur="4.2">communities to set entries and vote on</text><text start="5257.08" dur="5.28">their favorites and it&apos;s actually I</text><text start="5259.3" dur="4.919">think that joke Dao uh made a mechanism</text><text start="5262.36" dur="4.14">where people pitch jokes to the joke</text><text start="5264.219" dur="3.261">dial and they get funding if they tell</text><text start="5266.5" dur="3.0">them</text><text start="5267.48" dur="3.94">and but you could use it for anything</text><text start="5269.5" dur="3.06">you could use it for curating a</text><text start="5271.42" dur="3.779">community road map Community</text><text start="5272.56" dur="4.8">endorsements bounties uh generating</text><text start="5275.199" dur="3.841">ideas creations and

start="5281.62" dur="4.74">just making it a distributed</text><text start="5282.88" dur="5.22">decentralized joke contest every week so</text><text start="5286.36" dur="4.68">um</text><text start="5288.1" dur="4.86">uh you gotta go to joked out.ao to find</text><text start="5291.04" dur="4.02">out and I don&apos;t know I&apos;m just browsing</text><text start="5292.96" dur="4.02">the website and reading what I see it&apos;s</text><text start="5295.06" dur="4.44">got a token called joke the joke token</text><text start="5296.98" dur="4.44">and there&apos;s a joke race every uh looks</text><text start="5299.5" dur="4.56">like every every week I&apos;m getting that</text><text start="5301.42" dur="4.68">right this is not a financial advice but</text><text start="5304.06" dur="4.679">we&apos;re pumping this token no I&apos;m just</text><text start="5306.1" dur="6.0">kidding this is so this is so funny man</text><text start="5308.739" dur="4.801">uh what I I love it I can&apos;t I I&apos;m</text><text start="5312.1" dur="4.079">excited to read up on how it actually</text><text start="5313.54" dur="4.56">works because you know I wouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="5316.179" dur="3.06">surprised honestly if it just uses one</text><text start="5318.1" dur="2.16">of the mechanisms that we already</text><text start="5319.239" dur="2.041">mentioned</text><text start="5320.26" dur="2.64">mm-hmm</text><text start="5321.28" dur="3.48">yeah it&apos;s possible it almost feels like</text><text start="5322.9" dur="4.62">a decentralized slido to me</text><text start="5324.76" dur="3.72">ooh slido what do you mean yeah uh Saito</text><text start="5327.52" dur="2.159">is a way where basically if you&apos;re</text><text start="5328.48" dur="3.12">holding a meeting with someone you can</text><text start="5329.679" dur="4.861">distribute a slido and they can all put</text><text start="5331.6" dur="5.039">ideas into the slido and then people can</text><text start="5334.54" dur="3.72">upvote each other&apos;s ideas so whenever I</text><text start="5336.639" dur="3.781">have a call with like 20 people but we</text><text start="5338.26" dur="4.68">only have like 60 minutes to get through</text><text start="5340.42" dur="3.6">it I&apos;m like hey go vote on this slido of</text><text start="5342.94" dur="2.759">what you guys want to talk about and</text><text start="5344.02" dur="4.56">we&apos;ll use the community consensus to</text><text start="5345.699" dur="4.02">vote up what is actually worth uh</text><text start="5348.58" dur="3.18">talking</text><text start="5349.719" dur="4.681">about yeah so it is kind of like</text><text start="5351.76" dur="5.0">quadratic voting upvotes basically</text><text start="5354.4" dur="5.04">mm-hmm yeah</text><text start="5356.76" dur="5.08">all right uh well my brain is Silly</text><text start="5359.44" dur="4.14">Putty what do we want to end on Griff I</text><text start="5361.84" dur="6.66">I the opportunities in the space man</text><text start="5363.58" dur="7.68">it&apos;s insane I mean uh I feel like uh I I</text><text start="5368.5" dur="4.679">give the same I&apos;ve given this this talk</text><text start="5371.26" dur="3.419">a few times or mentioned in many talks</text><text start="5373.179" dur="4.801">but the opportunity in the public good</text><text start="5374.679" dur="5.281">space is so huge uh if I want to end it</text><text start="5377.98" dur="3.48">anywhere you know we&apos;re just waxing</text><text start="5379.96" dur="3.3">philosophically about how to make the</text><text start="5381.46" dur="3.6">world a better place but if we can</text><text start="5383.26" dur="5.58">actually make the world a better place</text><text start="5385.06" dur="7.2">in a way uh that we do it better than</text><text start="5388.84" dur="5.28">governments can then all of imagine all</text><text start="5392.26" dur="4.62">of the funding that would be unlocked</text><text start="5394.12" dur="4.98">that right now is just being burned by</text><text start="5396.88" dur="5.58">governments to provide value to society</text><text start="5399.1" dur="6.119">with nothing in return if if the 25</text><text start="5402.46" dur="5.64">trillion dollars a year is my estimate</text><text start="5405.219" dur="5.101">adding up the different expenditures of</text><text start="5408.1" dur="4.86">governments around the world 25 trillion</text><text start="5410.32" dur="5.52">dollars a year is just burned on funding</text><text start="5412.96" dur="4.8">public goods and if we can actually</text><text start="5415.84" dur="4.799">capture some of the value that&apos;s being</text><text start="5417.76" dur="4.68">created I think the Market&apos;s even way</text><text start="5420.639" dur="4.441">larger than that because that market</text><text start="5422.44" dur="4.86">relies on sacrifice if we can create</text><text start="5425.08" dur="3.54">mechanisms that work that reward that</text><text start="5427.3" dur="3.24">actually reward the people who are</text><text start="5428.62" dur="3.78">contributing</text><text start="5430.54" dur="3.9">it&apos;s going to be huge we&apos;ll be able to</text><text start="5432.4" dur="4.38">take things that used to be private</text><text start="5434.44" dur="5.52">goods and Club goods and actually turn</text><text start="5436.78" dur="5.939">them into abundant resources for

dur="4.74">happening happens now because our public</text><text start="5447.1" dur="4.559">goods economies are so weak uh we&apos;ll</text><text start="5449.86" dur="4.319">actually go the other way

start="5456.82" dur="4.68">Shelter we can take those things out of</text><text start="5459.219" dur="5.46">the private Goods space and move it into</text><text start="5461.5" dur="4.679">the public good space it&apos;s I I just want</text><text start="5464.679" dur="3.901">to double click on that number there so</text><text start="5466.179" dur="3.96">when you say 20 trillion dollars uh</text><text start="5468.58" dur="3.42">you&apos;re talking about all of the spending</text><text start="5470.139" dur="4.02">on ngos federal governments state</text><text start="5472.0" dur="4.08">governments local governments across the</text><text start="5474.159" dur="3.781">world and our governments are the</text><text start="5476.08" dur="3.54">mechanisms that are Distributing or</text><text start="5477.94" dur="2.759">organizing public goods and so that&apos;s</text><text start="5479.62" dur="3.72">where that number comes from is that</text><text start="5480.699" dur="4.921">right exactly I mean the U.S government</text><text start="5483.34" dur="5.58">spends the U.S government and nonprofits</text><text start="5485.62" dur="6.599">together spend 10.5 trillion dollars so</text><text start="5488.92" dur="5.819">the adding uh you know 25 trillion is a</text><text start="5492.219" dur="4.681">very conservative estimate I&apos;m sure it&apos;s</text><text start="5494.739" dur="3.301">more than that so you&apos;re saying the</text><text start="5496.9" dur="3.12">federal government are including state</text><text start="5498.04" dur="3.84">and local too or state and local state</text><text start="5500.02" dur="4.139">the federal state and local count</text><text start="5501.88" dur="3.72">discounting the stats kind of crazy</text><text start="5504.159" dur="3.601">because if you add them all up</text><text start="5505.6" dur="4.2">individually it&apos;s actually more but it&apos;s</text><text start="5507.76" dur="3.78">because Federal governments fund state</text><text start="5509.8" dur="4.76">governments which fund local governments</text><text start="5511.54" dur="5.22">sometimes funding all the way down yeah</text><text

OG</text><text start="5799.06" dur="3.659">uh Dao technique that Dow stack really</text><text start="5801.34" dur="2.879">put forth and I think it&apos;s definitely</text><text start="5802.719" dur="3.541">worth bringing in because it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="5804.219" dur="4.44">really cool and I&apos;m surprised there</text><text start="5806.26" dur="5.7">aren&apos;t more doubts using it it&apos;s uh it&apos;s</text><text start="5808.659" dur="6.241">kind of a mix of futurarchy and uh just</text><text start="5811.96" dur="5.34">regular Dow voting but basically anyone</text><text start="5814.9" dur="4.5">can put up a proposal and they they make</text><text start="5817.3" dur="4.919">it really easy to initiate a proposal</text><text start="5819.4" dur="6.42">and then the people who have Dow tokens</text><text start="5822.219" dur="5.221">can actually Vote or Planet bet on</text><text start="5825.82" dur="4.8">whether or not that proposal will be</text><text start="5827.44" dur="4.799">approved by the Dow and then</text><text start="5830.62" dur="4.079">um when they the when they do that</text><text start="5832.239" dur="4.861">they&apos;re basically boosting the The</text><text start="5834.699" dur="5.52">Proposal up so it gets more attention</text><text start="5837.1" dur="5.34">from the Dow like people and then and it</text><text start="5840.219" dur="5.041">speeds up the process I think to uh to</text><text start="5842.44" dur="5.279">vote on it and then if it passes and</text><text start="5845.26" dur="4.56">people bet for it then it becomes like</text><text start="5847.719" dur="4.44">uh then then those people actually win</text><text start="5849.82" dur="4.319">money and if people bet against it they</text><text start="5852.159" dur="4.321">would lose their stake right so that&apos;s</text><text start="5854.139" dur="3.961">kind of uh and I I think it&apos;s actually a</text><text start="5856.48" dur="4.32">pretty nice way because a 10 the</text><text start="5858.1" dur="4.68">attention economy is real and there&apos;s if</text><text start="5860.8" dur="4.439">if you have a lot of proposals how do</text><text start="5862.78" dur="4.62">you get them to actually be in front of</text><text start="5865.239" dur="4.141">people you know and it&apos;s like well I</text><text start="5867.4" dur="3.66">think if you&apos;re willing to put money and</text><text start="5869.38" dur="3.359">bet that these people will approve it</text><text start="5871.06" dur="2.34">that&apos;s a good signal</text><text start="5872.739" dur="2.221">um</text><text start="5873.4" dur="4.14">so as I understand it&apos;s a way of getting</text><text start="5874.96" dur="4.199">from like vote low voter turnout to</text><text start="5877.54" dur="3.44">taking a holograph of the like a low</text><text start="5879.159" dur="4.861">voter turnout and trying to get a more</text><text start="5880.98" dur="3.94">representative turnout uh is that right</text><text start="5884.02" dur="4.199">at all</text><text start="5884.92" dur="5.219">yeah and it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of saving the</text><text start="5888.219" dur="4.141">voters attention you know it&apos;s like</text><text start="5890.139" dur="4.861">trying to be especially if there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="5892.36" dur="5.819">of votes you know I think most of these</text><text start="5895.0" dur="5.219">con these mechanisms work best if a lot</text><text start="5898.179" dur="3.54">of them are designed with this idea in</text><text start="5900.219" dur="3.0">mind that a lot of people will make a</text><text start="5901.719" dur="3.361">lot of votes</text><text start="5903.219" dur="3.361">um like holographic consensus is a</text><text start="5905.08" dur="4.44">complete waste of time if there&apos;s like</text><text start="5906.58" dur="5.04">one Dow vote a month but if there&apos;s uh</text><text start="5909.52" dur="5.46">because in fact even</text><text start="5911.62" dur="6.059">um the threshold to be like voted on</text><text start="5914.98" dur="4.739">depends on how many other projects are</text><text start="5917.679" dur="4.081">being boosted past the threshold so</text><text start="5919.719" dur="4.801">there&apos;s this little algorithm where it&apos;s</text><text start="5921.76" dur="4.919">like there&apos;s a constant two to the power</text><text start="5924.52" dur="6.48">of number of projects that are boosted</text><text start="5926.679" dur="6.721">right and uh the threshold to be like</text><text start="5931.0" dur="4.38">kind of up for vote is you can almost</text><text start="5933.4" dur="3.299">think of it like um</text><text start="5935.38" dur="4.14">um what do you call it where you have to</text><text start="5936.699" dur="5.52">get so many signatures before a proposal</text><text start="5939.52" dur="4.5">can actually go up for vote</text><text start="5942.219" dur="4.741">um it&apos;s kind of similar to that but for</text><text start="5944.02" dur="5.04">Dallas and it is betting</text><text start="5946.96" dur="3.66">so when we first recorded this we said</text><text start="5949.06" dur="3.24">for each mechanism we talk about what is</text><text start="5950.62" dur="4.5">it and what does it work well on and</text><text start="5952.3" dur="4.56">what does it not work well on so uh is</text><text start="5955.12" dur="4.619">it worth quickly revisiting that with</text><text start="5956.86" dur="4.2">respect to holographic consensus yeah I</text><text start="5959.739" dur="4.861">mean I think it works well when there&apos;s</text><text start="5961.06" dur="7.139">a lot of proposals and people have like</text><text start="5964.6" dur="7.139">attention like like too much too many</text><text start="5968.199" dur="5.341">things to pay attention to and I I think</text><text start="5971.739" dur="4.261">I think it would work well in that</text><text start="5973.54" dur="3.599">scenario as as an attempt</text><text start="5976.0" dur="2.82">um I don&apos;t think it would work well if</text><text start="5977.139" dur="3.901">there&apos;s hardly any proposals out there</text><text start="5978.82" dur="4.08">or also if just you know it&apos;s a small</text><text start="5981.04" dur="4.74">group of people I think it&apos;s really</text><text start="5982.9" dur="5.819">designed for like large groups of people</text><text start="5985.78" dur="4.2">where you have a few people that are</text><text start="5988.719" dur="2.881">really into it you know and they&apos;re</text><text start="5989.98" dur="4.259">going to be making bets and whether or</text><text start="5991.6" dur="5.22">not people like this or not and and kind</text><text start="5994.239" dur="4.741">of like a curator aspect and then</text><text start="5996.82" dur="3.839">there&apos;s this large group that you know</text><text start="5998.98" dur="3.96">they only want to come in and vote once</text><text start="6000.659" dur="5.761">in a while and they&apos;re not going to dive</text><text start="6002.94" dur="5.52">deep into everything that&apos;s awesome</text><text start="6006.42" dur="3.6">got it feels like it competes a little</text><text start="6008.46" dur="3.36">bit with like the delegation model that</text><text start="6010.02" dur="3.48">get coin dial works on where the token</text><text start="6011.82" dur="3.54">holders just delegate to the more active</text><text start="6013.5" dur="3.54">people and that&apos;s their way of solving</text><text start="6015.36" dur="3.18">the low voter turnout problem with</text><text start="6017.04" dur="4.26">Dallas this is like an alternative way</text><text start="6018.54" dur="5.58">of of solving that yeah it&apos;s yeah</text><text start="6021.3" dur="4.5">exactly and now but I&apos;m excited about</text><text start="6024.12" dur="4.559">this next one and got on the list man</text><text start="6025.8" dur="4.08">skeuomorphism I yes Beyond me I don&apos;t</text><text start="6028.679" dur="3.781">know this one let&apos;s do it so</text><text start="6029.88" dur="4.02">skeuomorphism is basically the idea uh</text><text start="6032.46" dur="3.3">it&apos;s it&apos;s actually not a mechanism</text><text start="6033.9" dur="4.2">itself it&apos;s a categorization of</text><text start="6035.76" dur="5.1">mechanisms and what skeuomorphism means</text><text start="6038.1" dur="4.92">is that something is skeuomorphic if it</text><text start="6040.86" dur="3.54">could exist in the old world if you&apos;re</text><text start="6043.02" dur="3.06">taking something in the old world and</text><text start="6044.4" dur="3.48">just putting it online or putting on a</text><text start="6046.08" dur="3.3">blockchain then that&apos;s skeuomorphic and</text><text start="6047.88" dur="5.04">the example of skeuomorphism I like to</text><text start="6049.38" dur="5.46">use is is is one from web web one and</text><text start="6052.92" dur="3.96">web 2 because you know in hindsight it&apos;s</text><text start="6054.84" dur="5.7">easier to understand things and</text><text start="6056.88" dur="6.359">basically skeuomorphism is this idea uh</text><text start="6060.54" dur="5.099">like through by wave example Yahoo and</text><text start="6063.239" dur="4.44">Google both had the goal of organizing</text><text start="6065.639" dur="4.261">the world&apos;s information on the internet</text><text start="6067.679" dur="3.901">and they just approached it in two</text><text start="6069.9" dur="3.839">different ways Yahoo took the library</text><text start="6071.58" dur="4.68">card catalog system this taxonomy of</text><text start="6073.739" dur="5.221">information and put it online and like</text><text start="6076.26" dur="4.2">if I wanted to find uh I don&apos;t know the</text><text start="6078.96" dur="3.62">Colorado Rockies I wouldn&apos;t have to go</text><text start="6080.46" dur="5.699">to the directory and put clicked Sports</text><text start="6082.58" dur="4.96">professional uh baseball Colorado and I</text><text start="6086.159" dur="2.461">would have gotten the Rockies whereas</text><text start="6087.54" dur="3.599">with Google I just went to the search</text><text start="6088.62" dur="4.32">box and I just went in and I typed in</text><text start="6091.139" dur="4.02">Colorado Rockies and I would find them</text><text start="6092.94" dur="4.02">in one and so Google invented a</text><text start="6095.159" dur="2.761">non-scheuomorphic mechanism for</text><text start="6096.96" dur="3.54">traversing the world&apos;s information</text><text start="6097.92" dur="5.04">whereas Yahoo had a skeuomorphic</text><text start="6100.5" dur="3.9">mechanism because they just took the</text><text start="6102.96" dur="3.779">library card catalog system and put it</text><text start="6104.4" dur="5.64">online so the idea here is that any new</text><text start="6106.739" dur="5.4">medium uh fundamental Innovation is</text><text start="6110.04" dur="4.38">going to enable a set of mechanisms that</text><text start="6112.139" dur="4.141">are non-scheomorphic over the horizon</text><text start="6114.42" dur="5.16">where if you fundamentally understand</text><text start="6116.28" dur="5.399">from first principles the medium that we</text><text start="6119.58" dur="3.42">are using then you&apos;re able to invent a</text><text start="6121.679" dur="3.781">whole new category of things that never</text><text start="6123.0" dur="4.679">existed and so you know taking this into</text><text start="6125.46" dur="4.279">the blockchain world we&apos;ve now got uh</text><text start="6127.679" dur="4.56">programmable transparent Global</text><text start="6129.739" dur="4.601">Incorruptible ledgers and what are we</text><text start="6132.239" dur="4.141">going to build on them well first like</text><text start="6134.34" dur="3.72">the the earliest ideas will be just to</text><text start="6136.38" dur="4.2">like Port over I don&apos;t know the joint</text><text start="6138.06" dur="4.079">stock Corporation onto the blockchain</text><text start="6140.58" dur="2.579">but the actually more interesting</text><text start="6142.139" dur="2.701">mechanisms are going to be</text><text start="6143.159" dur="4.56">non-scheomorphic and derived from the</text><text start="6144.84" dur="5.1">first principles of the internet age so</text><text start="6147.719" dur="4.201">not a mechanism itself but a category of</text><text start="6149.94" dur="4.14">mechanisms and I think the most my my</text><text start="6151.92" dur="3.66">sort of hot take here might be that the</text><text start="6154.08" dur="3.0">most interesting mechanisms that we</text><text start="6155.58" dur="4.02">design are going to be non-scheomorphic</text><text start="6157.08" dur="3.78">because uh the design space is so much</text><text start="6159.6" dur="2.519">greater there but it&apos;s also harder to</text><text start="6160.86" dur="3.299">think about</text><text start="6162.119" dur="4.381">I mean I think in general Collective</text><text start="6164.159" dur="4.621">resource allocation needs a refresher</text><text start="6166.5" dur="4.739">you know it hasn&apos;t it doesn&apos;t feel like</text><text start="6168.78" dur="5.7">it&apos;s really moved too too far forward in</text><text start="6171.239" dur="4.44">the last you know 100 200 years as far</text><text start="6174.48" dur="3.6">as I can tell</text><text start="6175.679" dur="3.901">yeah well I mean you know we we started</text><text start="6178.08" dur="3.78">the episode with that quote from Winston</text><text start="6179.58" dur="3.48">Churchill about democracy is the worst</text><text start="6181.86" dur="2.94">form of government except for all the</text><text start="6183.06" dur="3.96">other ones that have been tried right so</text><text start="6184.8" dur="5.399">now we have a bunch of non-scheomorphic</text><text start="6187.02" dur="5.4">mechanisms that we can try and maybe we</text><text start="6190.199" dur="3.781">can iterate on what was Industrial Age</text><text start="6192.42" dur="2.46">democracy from there so that&apos;s exciting</text><text start="6193.98" dur="3.48">to me</text><text start="6194.88" dur="4.259">definitely definitely would you call</text><text start="6197.46" dur="4.32">like the get-going governance with</text><text start="6199.139" dur="4.201">delegation would and and of course all</text><text start="6201.78" dur="4.62">the compound governance with delegation</text><text start="6203.34" dur="5.1">is that skeuomorphic or is it refreshed</text><text start="6206.4" dur="3.54">enough since it&apos;s token holders and like</text><text start="6208.44" dur="3.9">where does the line where do you draw</text><text start="6209.94" dur="5.279">the line yeah that&apos;s a good question I I</text><text start="6212.34" dur="4.92">feel like there&apos;s probably a gradient</text><text start="6215.219" dur="4.321">between like zero and one skeuomorphic</text><text start="6217.26" dur="4.14">and non-scheomorphic and</text><text start="6219.54" dur="3.36">um I would say that things like</text><text start="6221.4" dur="2.94">quadratic funding are probably pretty</text><text start="6222.9" dur="4.08">far in the non-scheomorphic direction</text><text start="6224.34" dur="4.08">whereas things that that that look like</text><text start="6226.98" dur="3.06">delegated governance we&apos;ve seen in</text><text start="6228.42" dur="3.12">representative democracies before and</text><text start="6230.04" dur="5.28">probably a little bit more skeuomorphic</text><text start="6231.54" dur="5.04">and you know uh yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s a</text><text start="6235.32" dur="2.22">spectrum though it&apos;s not it&apos;s not just</text><text start="6236.58" dur="4.32">binary</text><text start="6237.54" dur="5.04">yeah and you know sometimes we I think</text><text start="6240.9" dur="4.739">in this space we tend to innovate too</text><text start="6242.58" dur="5.7">much anyway you know like taking some</text><text start="6245.639" dur="4.741">oldies but goodies and bringing them</text><text start="6248.28" dur="4.02">into the space that everyone is familiar</text><text start="6250.38" dur="2.94">with is really nice and relaxing you</text><text start="6252.3" dur="3.899">know but you don&apos;t have to learn</text><text start="6253.32" dur="4.44">everything all the time yeah totally and</text><text start="6256.199" dur="2.94">you know there&apos;s uh there&apos;s this thing</text><text start="6257.76" dur="3.359">called gal&apos;s law</text><text start="6259.139" dur="3.781">um which is basically the idea that any</text><text start="6261.119" dur="4.56">sufficiently complex system that works</text><text start="6262.92" dur="5.219">started from a simpler system that works</text><text start="6265.679" dur="4.681">and it just complexified over time and</text><text start="6268.139" dur="4.801">so you know I don&apos;t want to totally drag</text><text start="6270.36" dur="4.14">on skeuomorphic mechanisms like bringing</text><text start="6272.94" dur="4.02">them on chain and just playing with them</text><text start="6274.5" dur="5.46">uh on chain and then make having them be</text><text start="6276.96" dur="5.159">forkable and uh people can play with</text><text start="6279.96" dur="3.3">them in using these tools from the</text><text start="6282.119" dur="2.58">convenience of their computer there&apos;s</text><text start="6283.26" dur="3.06">still a lot to be learned from those</text><text start="6284.699" dur="3.121">things but I do think there&apos;s going to</text><text start="6286.32" dur="3.0">be a whole category of non-skomorphic</text><text start="6287.82" dur="3.899">mechanisms that are going to be really</text><text start="6289.32" dur="4.02">the most interesting probably that&apos;s my</text><text start="6291.719" dur="3.301">prediction for the next 10 like 10 years</text><text start="6293.34" dur="4.44">from now I think that&apos;ll be true</text><text start="6295.02" dur="4.199">yeah totally well and and this kind of</text><text start="6297.78" dur="3.6">leans into the next one which is</text><text start="6299.219" dur="4.98">sortation because sortition it would</text><text start="6301.38" dur="4.62">definitely be skeuomorphic uh so Titian</text><text start="6304.199" dur="3.901">is do you mind if I just jump into this</text><text start="6306.0" dur="4.98">one let&apos;s do it please take us away yeah</text><text start="6308.1" dur="4.92">sortation is something that um we don&apos;t</text><text start="6310.98" dur="4.32">use that often in the real world mostly</text><text start="6313.02" dur="4.679">just for jury duty right you know when</text><text start="6315.3" dur="5.339">you kind of like a few people get</text><text start="6317.699" dur="5.161">randomly selected to become a juror in a</text><text start="6320.639" dur="5.161">in a court in the U.S uh that that</text><text start="6322.86" dur="5.759">process is sortition it&apos;s and and in</text><text start="6325.8" dur="5.1">general it means taking a few people of</text><text start="6328.619" dur="4.801">the subset of possible voters or</text><text start="6330.9" dur="6.42">possible decision makers and having them</text><text start="6333.42" dur="6.48">make the decision on their own so uh and</text><text start="6337.32" dur="5.16">they have done this for voting before</text><text start="6339.9" dur="5.04">like in especially around you know</text><text start="6342.48" dur="4.08">almost all polling you could say is</text><text start="6344.94" dur="4.08">almost like sortition but it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="6346.56" dur="5.46">have the impact of the vote and where</text><text start="6349.02" dur="5.699">you take a small subset of the possible</text><text start="6352.02" dur="5.099">voters and just have them decide and I</text><text start="6354.719" dur="4.741">haven&apos;t seen it in crypto actually I</text><text start="6357.119" dur="5.1">well that&apos;s not true I&apos;ve seen it for</text><text start="6359.46" dur="4.8">jurors selection like Celeste which is a</text><text start="6362.219" dur="5.581">uh kind of like Claris the subjective</text><text start="6364.26" dur="5.76">Oracle they they actually will</text><text start="6367.8" dur="5.58">um you know people will stake uh one on</text><text start="6370.02" dur="6.06">one hive&apos;s honey token to become a juror</text><text start="6373.38" dur="4.08">and uh sortation will be made and a few</text><text start="6376.08" dur="4.619">of those will be selected to actually</text><text start="6377.46" dur="5.699">decide whether or not this jury you know</text><text start="6380.699" dur="5.401">uh this conflict should be resolved in</text><text start="6383.159" dur="4.801">One Direction or the other but uh I</text><text start="6386.1" dur="4.32">haven&apos;t seen it I think it&apos;d actually be</text><text start="6387.96" dur="4.38">kind of interesting just to use this</text><text start="6390.42" dur="4.86">process for</text><text start="6392.34" dur="4.98">um you know actual Dow votes where you</text><text start="6395.28" dur="3.72">have you know these subset of holders</text><text start="6397.32" dur="3.299">and the number of tokens you have more</text><text start="6399.0" dur="4.199">likely you get called or something and</text><text start="6400.619" dur="4.981">maybe it&apos;s even with delegates and it</text><text start="6403.199" dur="5.46">and you just select you know 10 people</text><text start="6405.6" dur="4.8">and then or 11 maybe to make it an odd</text><text start="6408.659" dur="3.901">number and have them vote on whether or</text><text start="6410.4" dur="4.259">not this should happen or not and then</text><text start="6412.56" dur="3.42">those 11 people actually you know put in</text><text start="6414.659" dur="3.121">the time time they think about it</text><text start="6415.98" dur="4.08">because they know that their their</text><text start="6417.78" dur="4.02">decision will Ripple throughout the Dao</text><text start="6420.06" dur="4.02">and they&apos;ll have to be responsible for</text><text start="6421.8" dur="4.379">that but I think it&apos;d be kind of a fun</text><text start="6424.08" dur="4.38">way to mix it up instead of always</text><text start="6426.179" dur="4.741">having the same delegates do it as a</text><text start="6428.46" dur="4.44">profession here you get rid of it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="6430.92" dur="4.44">very much like delegated democracy</text><text start="6432.9" dur="6.06">except you get rid of the delegates and</text><text start="6435.36" dur="6.54">randomly choose people as as a as it</text><text start="6438.96" dur="4.679">comes up yeah what I like about that so</text><text start="6441.9" dur="3.239">selection of political officials as a</text><text start="6443.639" dur="3.301">random sample of larger pool of</text><text start="6445.139" dur="3.181">candidates is that you don&apos;t

dur="4.8">interesting to learn that I&apos;m just got</text><text start="6451.98" dur="5.1">the Wikipedia page up here uh in ancient</text><text start="6455.1" dur="3.539">Athenian democracy startition was the</text><text start="6457.08" dur="4.079">traditional and primary mechanism for</text><text start="6458.639" dur="3.661">appointing political officials so I I</text><text start="6461.159" dur="3.721">just think that it&apos;s it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="6462.3" dur="4.14">interesting that it&apos;s been the tires</text><text start="6464.88" dur="3.66">have been kicked on this so much in the</text><text start="6466.44" dur="3.36">past and yeah kind of interesting that</text><text start="6468.54" dur="3.0">we haven&apos;t seen it in the blockchain</text><text start="6469.8" dur="4.319">space at all which is supposed to be all</text><text start="6471.54" dur="3.96">about governance yeah yeah I think it</text><text start="6474.119" dur="3.661">would be really cool and and like you</text><text start="6475.5" dur="5.159">said it just allows the everyday man to</text><text start="6477.78" dur="5.28">come in there and and say their piece uh</text><text start="6480.659" dur="5.401">and and you can get rid of the politics</text><text start="6483.06" dur="5.099">but you know in some ways power kind of</text><text start="6486.06" dur="3.42">Aggregates into these small circles and</text><text start="6488.159" dur="3.0">they want to keep their powers so these</text><text start="6489.48" dur="3.239">kinds of voting mechanisms might not be</text><text start="6491.159" dur="2.701">favored</text><text start="6492.719" dur="3.241">yeah</text><text start="6493.86" dur="4.5">well um I think we&apos;re supposed to ask</text><text start="6495.96" dur="3.54">for each mechanism what is it what does</text><text start="6498.36" dur="2.7">it work really well and where does it</text><text start="6499.5" dur="2.52">not work well I think we kind of covered</text><text start="6501.06" dur="2.34">that but let me know if there&apos;s anything</text><text start="6502.02" dur="3.599">more to say before we move on to the</text><text start="6503.4" dur="4.56">next mechanism I I think startition</text><text start="6505.619" dur="4.08">could work well maybe the jury&apos;s out on</text><text start="6507.96" dur="3.779">crypto you know like we have to see it</text><text start="6509.699" dur="5.221">in use before I&apos;d say it works well or</text><text start="6511.739" dur="5.88">not right totally alrighty well the next</text><text start="6514.92" dur="4.799">one on our list is Aqueduct uh which is</text><text start="6517.619" dur="5.58">a mechanism that we&apos;ve been talking</text><text start="6519.719" dur="5.041">about at git coin uh Speech speaking of</text><text start="6523.199" dur="4.02">uh things that have been tried in the</text><text start="6524.76" dur="4.5">past you know uh in irrigation systems</text><text start="6527.219" dur="6.301">aqueducts are a way of carrying water</text><text start="6529.26" dur="6.06">from one system to another and so um</text><text start="6533.52" dur="5.82">basically you know if you&apos;re building a</text><text start="6535.32" dur="7.26">pluralistic uh civilizational scale</text><text start="6539.34" dur="4.859">system for funding public goods and say</text><text start="6542.58" dur="3.36">there&apos;s like giveth and CLR phone and</text><text start="6544.199" dur="3.721">get coin and optimism and all these</text><text start="6545.94" dur="4.259">other mechanisms what does it look like</text><text start="6547.92" dur="5.52">to build Bridges between those</text><text start="6550.199" dur="4.801">mechanisms as a mechanism itself so</text><text start="6553.44" dur="3.48">um you know I I there&apos;s something on the</text><text start="6555.0" dur="4.38">Bitcoin governance Forum about aqueducts</text><text start="6556.92" dur="5.819">and basically the idea here is that if</text><text start="6559.38" dur="5.759">you sign up for a get coin Aqueduct what</text><text start="6562.739" dur="4.92">you can do is as part of your initial</text><text start="6565.139" dur="4.741">token allocation or as part of your</text><text start="6567.659" dur="4.801">ongoing efforts to build your your</text><text start="6569.88" dur="4.92">ecosystem you can set an aqueduct from</text><text start="6572.46" dur="4.259">your main treasury into Bitcoin grants</text><text start="6574.8" dur="4.02">into a pool of funds that will be</text><text start="6576.719" dur="4.201">allocated to do quadratic funding for</text><text start="6578.82" dur="4.62">your own community and then you can have</text><text start="6580.92" dur="5.16">a further Aqueduct from that to the main</text><text start="6583.44" dur="5.04">matching pool to of ethereum public</text><text start="6586.08" dur="4.32">goods because you&apos;re built on top of</text><text start="6588.48" dur="3.3">ethereum public goods and maybe you</text><text start="6590.4" dur="3.779">could even like if Bitcoin gets there</text><text start="6591.78" dur="5.58">one day if there was a uh all open</text><text start="6594.179" dur="6.421">source or like all Global uh public</text><text start="6597.36" dur="5.1">goods like climate and uh roads and</text><text start="6600.6" dur="3.24">bridges and all other Global public</text><text start="6602.46" dur="4.259">goods there could be a further Aqueduct</text><text start="6603.84" dur="4.319">from there so aqueducts are like in in</text><text start="6606.719" dur="3.181">ancient times a way of carrying water</text><text start="6608.159" dur="4.58">irrigation from one place to another</text><text start="6609.9" dur="5.819">what if we could set up aqueducts</text><text start="6612.739" dur="4.601">that between the modules of public goods</text><text start="6615.719" dur="4.141">funding and the example that I gave was</text><text start="6617.34" dur="6.0">was the get coin matching pools but you</text><text start="6619.86" dur="5.879">could imagine any sort of Aqueduct that</text><text start="6623.34" dur="3.779">um that that goes between any of these</text><text start="6625.739" dur="3.061">mechanisms as we&apos;re building this</text><text start="6627.119" dur="4.08">pluralistic web scale civilizational</text><text start="6628.8" dur="4.2">scale uh infrastructure for funding</text><text start="6631.199" dur="3.781">public goods and I think radical drips</text><text start="6633.0" dur="3.42">is doing a really interesting point here</text><text start="6634.98" dur="3.48">where like it&apos;s it&apos;s literally called</text><text start="6636.42" dur="3.9">radical drips and you can program like</text><text start="6638.46" dur="3.42">faucets where a certain percentage will</text><text start="6640.32" dur="3.299">go here and a certain percentage will go</text><text start="6641.88" dur="2.64">there according to your governance so I</text><text start="6643.619" dur="3.54">think it&apos;s a really interesting</text><text start="6644.52" dur="4.139">primitive to to think about because</text><text start="6647.159" dur="3.721">everything that we&apos;re building in this</text><text start="6648.659" dur="5.401">space is so plural and modular</text><text start="6650.88" dur="4.92">yeah it it&apos;s it&apos;s totally like a stream</text><text start="6654.06" dur="4.139">is the way you&apos;re saying it right like</text><text start="6655.8" dur="5.28">that your your governance your issuance</text><text start="6658.199" dur="4.98">of your token in some way or your of</text><text start="6661.08" dur="5.7">some kind of allocation of funds then</text><text start="6663.179" dur="6.841">one way or another is streamed on a</text><text start="6666.78" dur="4.919">regular basis yeah like do you have a do</text><text start="6670.02" dur="3.719">you have a mechanism for that like do</text><text start="6671.699" dur="5.221">you have like a specific algorithm of</text><text start="6673.739" dur="6.241">how it gets distributed or like how does</text><text start="6676.92" dur="6.6">the actual allocation get decided I</text><text start="6679.98" dur="5.4">guess yeah well um so</text><text start="6683.52" dur="3.54">I can only speak so this is a</text><text start="6685.38" dur="3.54">generalizable thing that anyone can use</text><text start="6687.06" dur="3.599">to partner with anyone else in this</text><text start="6688.92" dur="3.54">whole Dow of Dallas that is being built</text><text start="6690.659" dur="3.121">but specific to get coin there&apos;s an</text><text start="6692.46" dur="3.179">aqueduct that&apos;s going to be launching</text><text start="6693.78" dur="3.419">when Bitcoin grants 2 launches and I</text><text start="6695.639" dur="3.661">only know this because it was</text><text start="6697.199" dur="3.361">pre-negotiated before I left getcoin&apos;s</text><text start="6699.3" dur="3.72">leadership but basically the idea is</text><text start="6700.56" dur="4.32">there&apos;s a dial launching uh and I won&apos;t</text><text start="6703.02" dur="3.36">say who because it&apos;s not the right time</text><text start="6704.88" dur="2.819">to announce that but they&apos;re going to</text><text start="6706.38" dur="3.72">have a lot of their initial allocation</text><text start="6707.699" dur="3.901">set to get coin aqueducts at the initial</text><text start="6710.1" dur="3.72">conditions and governance can change it</text><text start="6711.6" dur="4.32">if they want but basically the tokens</text><text start="6713.82" dur="3.54">will flow over a vesting schedule into</text><text start="6715.92" dur="4.02">the get coin grants matching pool</text><text start="6717.36" dur="5.7">Bitcoin grants will run a quadratic</text><text start="6719.94" dur="5.04">funding round for that community and</text><text start="6723.06" dur="4.92">um there&apos;s and and a certain percentage</text><text start="6724.98" dur="4.56">of that community&apos;s uh tokens will go</text><text start="6727.98" dur="3.12">down into the main ethereum matching</text><text start="6729.54" dur="3.78">pool so they get to be sponsors of both</text><text start="6731.1" dur="3.539">matching pools and it&apos;s just totally up</text><text start="6733.32" dur="2.76">to their governance whether they want to</text><text start="6734.639" dur="4.02">like say git coin does a really great</text><text start="6736.08" dur="4.139">job they could turn up the aqueduct or</text><text start="6738.659" dur="3.601">say get coin [ __ ] it up they could turn</text><text start="6740.219" dur="4.081">off the aqueduct and you know use any</text><text start="6742.26" dur="4.379">other platform to do it so basically</text><text start="6744.3" dur="3.48">aqueducts are a way of going from um you</text><text start="6746.639" dur="2.941">know what it actually reminds me of is</text><text start="6747.78" dur="3.24">like when I when I I worked at a</text><text start="6749.58" dur="3.24">retirement company it was like the most</text><text start="6751.02" dur="3.54">tradify job that I ever worked at before</text><text start="6752.82" dur="4.62">I got into crypto and they were always</text><text start="6754.56" dur="6.059">trying to get people to put their uh a</text><text start="6757.44" dur="4.679">percentage of their paychecks into</text><text start="6760.619" dur="2.701">um into their retirement funds because</text><text start="6762.119" dur="3.301">you said it and forget it you don&apos;t have</text><text start="6763.32" dur="3.66">to remember to invest in retirement it</text><text start="6765.42" dur="3.239">just happens as you&apos;re getting paid an</text><text start="6766.98" dur="3.48">aqueducts is kind of the same thing for</text><text start="6768.659" dur="3.201">Community Building or public goods</text><text start="6770.46" dur="4.259">funding</text><text start="6771.86" dur="4.779">interesting interesting and is that</text><text start="6774.719" dur="3.9">would that be the first aqueduct that</text><text start="6776.639" dur="3.661">that get coin put out with this with</text><text start="6778.619" dur="3.721">this new Dow there are things that are</text><text start="6780.3" dur="3.72">Aqua ducky which is a word I just made</text><text start="6782.34" dur="3.48">up that have happened so far but this</text><text start="6784.02" dur="3.9">will be the first formal like handshake</text><text start="6785.82" dur="4.62">where marketing and as an aqueduct thing</text><text start="6787.92" dur="4.38">that like bitcoin&apos;s doing yeah I mean</text><text start="6790.44" dur="3.36">obviously like you said radical drips I</text><text start="6792.3" dur="3.78">mean I have a radical drip going right</text><text start="6793.8" dur="5.16">now and it streams you know from the pot</text><text start="6796.08" dur="4.38">that I gave it to uh to a few projects</text><text start="6798.96" dur="4.5">and it&apos;s super cool because then they</text><text start="6800.46" dur="5.34">can continue to stream on uh and and so</text><text start="6803.46" dur="4.56">maybe this idea of just like setting</text><text start="6805.8" dur="4.68">streams set it and forget it I actually</text><text start="6808.02" dur="3.84">and in general magic which is a</text><text start="6810.48" dur="3.719">organization that I run there is one</text><text start="6811.86" dur="5.1">person who&apos;s paid by a stream right</text><text start="6814.199" dur="4.861">where they we don&apos;t pay them every month</text><text start="6816.96" dur="4.32">they actually just have a stream set to</text><text start="6819.06" dur="3.42">them and if they got fired or uh you</text><text start="6821.28" dur="3.06">know we would end this stream and if</text><text start="6822.48" dur="4.32">they got a raise we would up the stream</text><text start="6824.34" dur="4.98">yeah that&apos;s that&apos;s kind of it was a it&apos;s</text><text start="6826.8" dur="4.439">a beta test but it&apos;s it feels like the</text><text start="6829.32" dur="4.08">same kind of idea and I I think that&apos;s</text><text start="6831.239" dur="3.181">pretty cool yeah I mean maybe I</text><text start="6833.4" dur="2.4">shouldn&apos;t have led with calling this</text><text start="6834.42" dur="3.42">Aqueduct maybe now that you were calling</text><text start="6835.8" dur="2.64">it streaming money because</text><text start="6837.84" dur="2.339">um</text><text start="6838.44" dur="4.739">it&apos;s just really cool to have your</text><text start="6840.179" dur="5.101">paycheck paid every second or a monthly</text><text start="6843.179" dur="4.741">subscription debited every single second</text><text start="6845.28" dur="3.78">and uh it&apos;s almost like it reminds me of</text><text start="6847.92" dur="3.239">subscriptions there&apos;s such a big</text><text start="6849.06" dur="4.5">mechanism in web 2 but if you take the</text><text start="6851.159" dur="5.101">you know I paid 9.99 a month for Netflix</text><text start="6853.56" dur="5.88">and if you take a subscription down from</text><text start="6856.26" dur="4.859">monthly to weekly to daily to hourly to</text><text start="6859.44" dur="4.199">minutely to secondly you&apos;ve basically</text><text start="6861.119" dur="4.681">got streaming money at that point so</text><text start="6863.639" dur="4.141">um yeah maybe maybe streaming money is</text><text start="6865.8" dur="4.62">the general high-level primitive here</text><text start="6867.78" dur="4.14">and it can be you know uh credibility</text><text start="6870.42" dur="2.819">and legitimacy and tokens Can Be</text><text start="6871.92" dur="3.96">streamed from any of these mechanisms to</text><text start="6873.239" dur="5.781">any of these other mechanisms yeah yeah</text><text start="6875.88" dur="5.4">I think so that&apos;s that&apos;s cool all right</text><text start="6879.02" dur="3.639">ranked Choice voting yeah let&apos;s let&apos;s</text><text start="6881.28" dur="3.06">move on because we said we were going to</text><text start="6882.659" dur="4.56">do this in a half hour and we had we&apos;re</text><text start="6884.34" dur="4.5">yeah ranked Choice voting let&apos;s go so</text><text start="6887.219" dur="2.881">ranked Choice voting is super cool and</text><text start="6888.84" dur="3.359">actually there&apos;s a huge ranked Choice</text><text start="6890.1" dur="4.139">vote happening right now at the ens Dow</text><text start="6892.199" dur="4.561">or they&apos;re choosing someone to manage</text><text start="6894.239" dur="4.561">their endowment and so instead of going</text><text start="6896.76" dur="3.66">and saying this person is my favorite</text><text start="6898.8" dur="4.2">and the rest of them suck like just</text><text start="6900.42" dur="4.38">choosing uh a representative basically</text><text start="6903.0" dur="4.739">for your who you who you want to vote</text><text start="6904.8" dur="5.1">for the treasury uh you get to put in a</text><text start="6907.739" dur="4.801">little bit more context you can actually</text><text start="6909.9" dur="5.279">say well this is my preference Preferred</text><text start="6912.54" dur="4.26">Choice and if they don&apos;t win then I like</text><text start="6915.179" dur="4.081">this person to win and if they don&apos;t win</text><text start="6916.8" dur="3.96">then I&apos;d like this person to win and and</text><text start="6919.26" dur="3.479">there&apos;s only four choices so it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="6920.76" dur="3.84">matter the last if the Last Choice wins</text><text start="6922.739" dur="3.541">then then hey you lost you know that&apos;s</text><text start="6924.6" dur="3.66">just how it is but what&apos;s cool about</text><text start="6926.28" dur="3.48">this ranked Choice voting uh this</text><text start="6928.26" dur="4.979">mechanism is that they actually count</text><text start="6929.76" dur="5.82">the votes that way so in the traditional</text><text start="6933.239" dur="4.5">first pass the post voting system which</text><text start="6935.58" dur="4.38">is what we know in in our traditional</text><text start="6937.739" dur="5.161">democracies where it&apos;s like well you got</text><text start="6939.96" dur="4.92">to vote for Biden or Trump right uh okay</text><text start="6942.9" dur="3.6">well actually I don&apos;t want either of</text><text start="6944.88" dur="3.779">those guys I&apos;d rather have this third</text><text start="6946.5" dur="4.38">party candidate but if I waste my vote</text><text start="6948.659" dur="4.261">on this third party candidate then the</text><text start="6950.88" dur="4.02">guy I don&apos;t like will win so I have to</text><text start="6952.92" dur="3.66">vote for the least evil that&apos;s probably</text><text start="6954.9" dur="3.06">going to win but with ranked Choice</text><text start="6956.58" dur="4.619">voting you can put your third party</text><text start="6957.96" dur="5.46">candidate first and then put the Lesser</text><text start="6961.199" dur="4.321">evil at the bottom of the list and when</text><text start="6963.42" dur="4.08">the votes are actually counted if your</text><text start="6965.52" dur="4.26">third party candidate doesn&apos;t has the</text><text start="6967.5" dur="4.5">least number of First Place votes then</text><text start="6969.78" dur="4.56">then that vote is removed but your</text><text start="6972.0" dur="6.0">voting power your signal is still there</text><text start="6974.34" dur="6.42">so then now your second place vote is</text><text start="6978.0" dur="6.0">considered your top Place vote and then</text><text start="6980.76" dur="6.18">they the account runs again and if uh</text><text start="6984.0" dur="5.88">this one you know has 50 percent of the</text><text start="6986.94" dur="5.04">vote uh or sorry the first time that a</text><text start="6989.88" dur="4.259">first place one has fifty percent of the</text><text start="6991.98" dur="4.86">vote then they win that&apos;s it and that&apos;s</text><text start="6994.139" dur="4.56">the end of that rounds uh but it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="6996.84" dur="3.779">really cool because it actually allows</text><text start="6998.699" dur="4.5">for minority candidates to have a chance</text><text start="7000.619" dur="4.341">uh and and have some actual</text><text start="7003.199" dur="5.401">understanding of how many people</text><text start="7004.96" dur="5.62">appreciate them uh yeah and so I love</text><text start="7008.6" dur="4.019">ranked Choice voting and actually token</text><text start="7010.58" dur="3.84">engineering Commons kicked it up a notch</text><text start="7012.619" dur="3.301">and made it quadratic ranked Choice</text><text start="7014.42" dur="2.94">voting because</text><text start="7015.92" dur="3.66">normally in ranked Choice voting</text><text start="7017.36" dur="4.319">everyone gets one vote uh especially you</text><text start="7019.58" dur="4.68">know one person one vote kind of systems</text><text start="7021.679" dur="4.44">but we have tokens here and you know</text><text start="7024.26" dur="4.379">it&apos;s really quadratic voting is just</text><text start="7026.119" dur="5.821">better than plutocracy plutocratic</text><text start="7028.639" dur="5.58">voting so uh we I think it&apos;s for only</text><text start="7031.94" dur="3.9">time ever but uh we actually use</text><text start="7034.219" dur="4.201">quadratic ranked Choice voting which is</text><text start="7035.84" dur="4.799">the same process but each vote is token</text><text start="7038.42" dur="4.14">weighted so yeah that was cool so I mean</text><text start="7040.639" dur="3.96">it feels like a real great mechanism for</text><text start="7042.56" dur="4.8">making perfect not the enemy of good and</text><text start="7044.599" dur="4.741">it ruins it it it it takes away the</text><text start="7047.36" dur="4.5">third party spoiler effect when you&apos;ve</text><text start="7049.34" dur="4.44">got two major parties and</text><text start="7051.86" dur="3.48">um and and so that feels like that&apos;s</text><text start="7053.78" dur="3.48">what&apos;s really powerful about it I think</text><text start="7055.34" dur="3.72">if I if I&apos;m not mistaken I&apos;ve heard</text><text start="7057.26" dur="3.899">Andrew Yang say this is a way that we</text><text start="7059.06" dur="4.079">should do our primaries in in the United</text><text start="7061.159" dur="3.841">States and it may be getting some speed</text><text start="7063.139" dur="4.441">in the forward party that he&apos;s been</text><text start="7065.0" dur="4.8">doing they they actively use it in</text><text start="7067.58" dur="4.98">smaller in like local governments I I</text><text start="7069.8" dur="5.04">can&apos;t I think it&apos;s Maine uses it in in</text><text start="7072.56" dur="4.079">in in a few of their</text><text start="7074.84" dur="3.06">um thing I can&apos;t remember anymore which</text><text start="7076.639" dur="3.301">states actually use it but I think</text><text start="7077.9" dur="3.779">there&apos;s a few that actually use this in</text><text start="7079.94" dur="3.239">their in their systems and it works</text><text start="7081.679" dur="4.44">really well when you have a large pool</text><text start="7083.179" dur="6.121">of candidates and you don&apos;t want to uh</text><text start="7086.119" dur="4.801">you know buy and and especially if</text><text start="7089.3" dur="4.919">someone&apos;s not going to get more than 50</text><text start="7090.92" dur="4.86">by default then it works really well I</text><text start="7094.219" dur="3.241">don&apos;t think it works I don&apos;t it&apos;s a</text><text start="7095.78" dur="3.72">waste of time if you only have yes or no</text><text start="7097.46" dur="3.84">like it only really works for decisions</text><text start="7099.5" dur="4.26">that are like here&apos;s a list of</text><text start="7101.3" dur="5.6">candidates or a list of options and</text><text start="7103.76" dur="6.06">they&apos;re exclusive so we have to pick one</text><text start="7106.9" dur="4.6">rank the order of you know decide the</text><text start="7109.82" dur="4.2">Futures that you think are best for you</text><text start="7111.5" dur="4.32">you know yeah yeah I mean I think that</text><text start="7114.02" dur="2.88">this is the one that you and I dm&apos;d each</text><text start="7115.82" dur="2.64">other and we&apos;re like shoot we didn&apos;t</text><text start="7116.9" dur="3.319">cover this this is a really important</text><text start="7118.46" dur="5.46">mechanism so we got to do a part two</text><text start="7120.219" dur="6.161">yeah yeah but let&apos;s let&apos;s move on to</text><text start="7123.92" dur="3.779">staking and slashing yeah so another one</text><text start="7126.38" dur="3.18">that we were like oh wait we didn&apos;t</text><text start="7127.699" dur="4.621">cover this we should have is staking and</text><text start="7129.56" dur="4.139">slashing so basically uh eth just moved</text><text start="7132.32" dur="4.859">to proof of stake and the mechanism</text><text start="7133.699" dur="6.241">there is that you put 32 each up at</text><text start="7137.179" dur="4.44">stake and basically you run a validator</text><text start="7139.94" dur="4.08">and as long as that validator follows</text><text start="7141.619" dur="5.941">the protocol consensus route rules then</text><text start="7144.02" dur="7.56">it&apos;ll get a slight inflationary piece of</text><text start="7147.56" dur="6.3">the uh of the supply well inflationary</text><text start="7151.58" dur="4.26">in in some sense but the actual total</text><text start="7153.86" dur="3.839">Network is deflationary for reasons that</text><text start="7155.84" dur="3.54">are external to this mechanism but</text><text start="7157.699" dur="5.94">basically it can be that your state can</text><text start="7159.38" dur="6.48">be slashed if you are uh if you if you</text><text start="7163.639" dur="3.54">lie so to the protocol so basically if</text><text start="7165.86" dur="4.62">you can if you do anything that could</text><text start="7167.179" dur="4.56">cause a consensus Fork then uh then</text><text start="7170.48" dur="3.48">basically you can be slashed and you</text><text start="7171.739" dur="3.96">lose your deposit and there&apos;s also an</text><text start="7173.96" dur="3.96">inactivity leak where if you&apos;re offline</text><text start="7175.699" dur="5.221">for like a day or two you lose a couple</text><text start="7177.92" dur="4.92">of of guay a day and so basically it&apos;s a</text><text start="7180.92" dur="5.4">way of creating a crypto economic</text><text start="7182.84" dur="5.64">incentive to uh because money is at</text><text start="7186.32" dur="4.44">stake and can be slashed or increased at</text><text start="7188.48" dur="4.199">any time by the protocol it&apos;s a way of</text><text start="7190.76" dur="5.16">aligning Capital with a certain set of</text><text start="7192.679" dur="6.301">outcomes and I I think that the</text><text start="7195.92" dur="5.16">ethalidators are a really kind of neat</text><text start="7198.98" dur="4.259">way of doing staking and slashing but</text><text start="7201.08" dur="4.38">there&apos;s lots of application examples of</text><text start="7203.239" dur="4.561">staking and slashing that are out there</text><text start="7205.46" dur="3.96">um I think that actually uh get coin and</text><text start="7207.8" dur="4.439">giveth have been experimenting with some</text><text start="7209.42" dur="3.96">form of staking at least with Bitcoin I</text><text start="7212.239" dur="2.94">know that you could stake on certain</text><text start="7213.38" dur="3.06">grants for a little while that you</text><text start="7215.179" dur="3.48">thought were high quality and the</text><text start="7216.44" dur="4.56">algorithm would take that into account</text><text start="7218.659" dur="4.5">in in one of its sorting mechanisms on</text><text start="7221.0" dur="5.04">the UI and the Sorting mechanism informs</text><text start="7223.159" dur="4.98">what gets funded so you know by staking</text><text start="7226.04" dur="3.42">your GTC you&apos;re actually able to push up</text><text start="7228.139" dur="3.121">and down the grants in the system but</text><text start="7229.46" dur="5.159">you all have y&apos;all giveth have some</text><text start="7231.26" dur="5.879">staking uh implemented right yeah it&apos;s</text><text start="7234.619" dur="4.141">give power and so we&apos;re we&apos;re like a</text><text start="7237.139" dur="3.841">week from launching maybe two weeks from</text><text start="7238.76" dur="3.72">launching uh just some ux issues and</text><text start="7240.98" dur="3.54">then and then it&apos;s live but right now</text><text start="7242.48" dur="4.739">you can stake and lock and you end up</text><text start="7244.52" dur="4.44">getting this give power and so the</text><text start="7247.219" dur="4.38">longer you lock the more good power you</text><text start="7248.96" dur="5.279">get and also the higher your API your</text><text start="7251.599" dur="5.701">your staking rewards you could say uh</text><text start="7254.239" dur="4.98">that you earn for for locking and then</text><text start="7257.3" dur="4.14">with that give power you curate the</text><text start="7259.219" dur="3.781">projects on the platform so if you want</text><text start="7261.44" dur="3.48">to support your favorite non-profit</text><text start="7263.0" dur="3.239">project without donating you can</text><text start="7264.92" dur="3.9">actually just take give tokens</text><text start="7266.239" dur="4.86">effectively behind that project and then</text><text start="7268.82" dur="4.26">boom they&apos;ll end up with uh when we have</text><text start="7271.099" dur="3.661">our matching fun system they&apos;ll get more</text><text start="7273.08" dur="3.24">matching rewards they&apos;ll they&apos;ll be</text><text start="7274.76" dur="4.439">higher up on the list so people see them</text><text start="7276.32" dur="4.919">faster when they want to donate and and</text><text start="7279.199" dur="4.141">also uh what I mentioned before and</text><text start="7281.239" dur="4.561">actually the last episode was the the</text><text start="7283.34" dur="4.98">donor rewards the donation mining that</text><text start="7285.8" dur="5.04">uh is actually determined based on how</text><text start="7288.32" dur="5.76">much give power is locked behind uh each</text><text start="7290.84" dur="5.52">project so so it&apos;s I think like it&apos;s</text><text start="7294.08" dur="4.559">basically this this staking proving you</text><text start="7296.36" dur="4.379">have skin in the game you know that</text><text start="7298.639" dur="4.321">gives you the power to kind of man</text><text start="7300.739" dur="4.98">manage certain pieces of the project I</text><text start="7302.96" dur="4.98">think one inch does it too uh and with</text><text start="7305.719" dur="4.44">their uh with a few of their variables</text><text start="7307.94" dur="4.5">that you can change there&apos;s a there&apos;s a</text><text start="7310.159" dur="5.52">lot of projects that uh that where you</text><text start="7312.44" dur="5.04">stake and lock uh some kind of asset of</text><text start="7315.679" dur="3.841">value and that basically keeps you</text><text start="7317.48" dur="3.119">honest and I think it&apos;s it&apos;s a great</text><text start="7319.52" dur="3.9">mechanism</text><text start="7320.599" dur="4.201">yeah I think that um</text><text start="7323.42" dur="3.06">while we&apos;re talking about the processes</text><text start="7324.8" dur="3.12">and minuses of each mechanism I think</text><text start="7326.48" dur="3.6">it&apos;s really great if you have Capital</text><text start="7327.92" dur="4.44">but that&apos;s the biggest downside is that</text><text start="7330.08" dur="3.84">it requires capital and therefore in a</text><text start="7332.36" dur="3.42">sense is a certain amount of plutocratic</text><text start="7333.92" dur="3.239">because if you&apos;re deploying to a</text><text start="7335.78" dur="3.72">population that isn&apos;t going to take</text><text start="7337.159" dur="3.781">their is living paycheck to paycheck or</text><text start="7339.5" dur="3.06">isn&apos;t gonna otherwise isn&apos;t going to put</text><text start="7340.94" dur="3.54">their Capital into a staking mechanism</text><text start="7342.56" dur="2.76">then you&apos;ve got the nothing at stake</text><text start="7344.48" dur="4.259">problem</text><text start="7345.32" dur="6.299">yeah yeah I mean I think this kind of</text><text start="7348.739" dur="5.761">monetary like plutocracy isn&apos;t so bad</text><text start="7351.619" dur="6.12">when you&apos;re managing a shared pot of</text><text start="7354.5" dur="5.84">funds right it&apos;s not it&apos;s not ideal I</text><text start="7357.739" dur="5.821">think quadratic plutocracy is better</text><text start="7360.34" dur="5.44">but in the end if you&apos;re dealing with</text><text start="7363.56" dur="5.099">financial input then having the people</text><text start="7365.78" dur="4.98">that are putting in financial</text><text start="7368.659" dur="3.781">um you know the financial power it&apos;s</text><text start="7370.76" dur="4.08">important to have it in there but if</text><text start="7372.44" dur="4.799">you&apos;re trying to you know figure out the</text><text start="7374.84" dur="4.319">laws of a country or you know the most</text><text start="7377.239" dur="3.841">decisions are not Financial nature so</text><text start="7379.159" dur="4.201">these kind of mechanisms just wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="7381.08" dur="4.38">be a good idea hmm</text><text start="7383.36" dur="4.5">uh let&apos;s move on to the next one which I</text><text start="7385.46" dur="4.279">think is proof of work yeah proof of</text><text start="7387.86" dur="4.14">work is obviously this the the</text><text start="7389.739" dur="5.201">predecessor to proof of stake and</text><text start="7392.0" dur="6.36">staking uh which which is how Bitcoin</text><text start="7394.94" dur="5.94">decides it&apos;s its distribution and you</text><text start="7398.36" dur="4.02">know people uh think proof of work you</text><text start="7400.88" dur="4.739">know how is this a collective resource</text><text

choosing over this public good</text><text start="7409.099" dur="5.701">that like which which blocks are</text><text start="7411.8" dur="6.06">actually the ones that uh are the truth</text><text start="7414.8" dur="5.1">and and the shared history but beyond</text><text start="7417.86" dur="4.379">that actually proof of work is used in a</text><text start="7419.9" dur="5.88">lot of other cool projects to distribute</text><text start="7422.239" dur="6.121">uh resources so uh there&apos;s the resource</text><text start="7425.78" dur="4.439">of course is inflation is the issuance I</text><text start="7428.36" dur="4.14">like this separation of issuance versus</text><text start="7430.219" dur="4.801">inflation inflation is like the</text><text start="7432.5" dur="4.98">experience of issues issuance affecting</text><text start="7435.02" dur="4.86">the market but</text><text start="7437.48" dur="4.679">um in issuance is just like Hey we&apos;re</text><text start="7439.88" dur="4.5">we&apos;re throwing we&apos;re printing money you</text><text start="7442.159" dur="4.201">know uh and that actually doesn&apos;t always</text><text start="7444.38" dur="5.12">cause inflation if there&apos;s other</text><text start="7446.36" dur="6.18">Dynamics involved so</text><text start="7449.5" dur="5.32">the the proof of work distributes</text><text start="7452.54" dur="4.92">issuance and if but sometimes the work</text><text start="7454.82" dur="5.22">is awesome right like a curecoin or</text><text start="7457.46" dur="3.84">folding coin they actually the proof the</text><text start="7460.04" dur="4.02">work that&apos;s being done is actually</text><text start="7461.3" dur="6.12">folding proteins for cancer research and</text><text

more issuance I I think</text><text start="7472.099" dur="5.58">proof of work you know starting in the</text><text start="7474.38" dur="5.759">digital space is super cool because it&apos;s</text><text start="7477.679" dur="4.92">very easy to be held accountable to the</text><text start="7480.139" dur="4.98">work that you&apos;re doing but in many ways</text><text start="7482.599" dur="4.56">we&apos;re actually taking proof of work to</text><text start="7485.119" dur="4.321">the next level in the public goods space</text><text start="7487.159" dur="3.901">and we&apos;re trying to say hey let&apos;s let&apos;s</text><text start="7489.44" dur="5.699">use some of these other Collective</text><text start="7491.06" dur="6.539">resource allocation to create a proof of</text><text start="7495.139" dur="5.281">work issuance in a way right where when</text><text start="7497.599" dur="4.981">when uh working work stream and get coin</text><text start="7500.42" dur="4.259">actually gets funding where did that</text><text start="7502.58" dur="4.5">money come from right it came from the</text><text start="7504.679" dur="5.101">Dow what and that those tokens were not</text><text start="7507.08" dur="4.619">in the circulating Supply at first so</text><text start="7509.78" dur="5.22">you could almost say that&apos;s a proof of</text><text start="7511.699" dur="5.46">work right this is being allocated uh</text><text start="7515.0" dur="3.9">using you know our public goods Legos</text><text start="7517.159" dur="4.141">are are piecing all these things</text><text start="7518.9" dur="6.779">together to actually make issuance</text><text start="7521.3" dur="7.26">affect more than just the digital space</text><text start="7525.679" dur="5.701">yeah I mean I think that you know uh</text><text start="7528.56" dur="6.119">there&apos;s a lot of power in proof of work</text><text start="7531.38" dur="5.04">and it&apos;s useful to remember that when</text><text start="7534.679" dur="3.901">proof of work has been mostly associated</text><text start="7536.42" dur="4.56">with Bitcoin experiments like folding at</text><text start="7538.58" dur="4.68">home and other uh I think seti at home</text><text start="7540.98" dur="4.46">was the uh as an astronomy nerd when I</text><text start="7543.26" dur="5.459">was growing up one of the original OG</text><text

carbon output on the Bitcoin</text><text start="7553.88" dur="3.12">network but the fact that there are</text><text start="7555.02" dur="3.719">proof of work networks that are way more</text><text start="7557.0" dur="3.06">carbon neutral than Bitcoin makes me not</text><text start="7558.739" dur="4.081">want to throw out the whole the whole</text><text start="7560.06" dur="4.079">category yeah there&apos;s actually a coin I</text><text start="7562.82" dur="2.7">don&apos;t know if it&apos;s even still around I</text><text start="7564.139" dur="4.441">think it was called grid coin or</text><text start="7565.52" dur="6.24">something that you could plug in any at</text><text start="7568.58" dur="4.86">home system and earn grid coin so you</text><text start="7571.76" dur="4.5">could do folding at home you could do</text><text start="7573.44" dur="5.34">study at home you could do uh the the</text><text start="7576.26" dur="4.5">at-home spectrum is is wide I think</text><text start="7578.78" dur="3.12">there&apos;s a lot of these cool and and I</text><text start="7580.76" dur="3.78">just love it because you&apos;re taking</text><text start="7581.9" dur="4.38">something that was altruistic and</text><text start="7584.54" dur="4.52">actually just flipping a switch and</text><text start="7586.28" dur="5.58">saying no actually it&apos;s economic and now</text><text start="7589.06" dur="5.26">uh boom people are actually doing it</text><text start="7591.86" dur="4.62">more like uh folding folding coin and</text><text start="7594.32" dur="5.819">curecoin have been number one on the</text><text start="7596.48" dur="5.699">folding at home like uh work board ever</text><text start="7600.139" dur="3.721">since they started uh just because</text><text start="7602.179" dur="3.841">they&apos;re printing magic internet money</text><text start="7603.86" dur="5.96">for the people who are participating and</text><text start="7606.02" dur="6.48">that&apos;s just more effective than altruism</text><text start="7609.82" dur="3.76">there you go I&apos;m not gonna take I&apos;m not</text><text start="7612.5" dur="2.52">going to take

start="7619.099" dur="2.401">posting all right I&apos;ve got one more</text><text start="7620.3" dur="4.02">mechanism on the list try to take us</text><text start="7621.5" dur="4.739">through it yeah let&apos;s do it cool uh the</text><text start="7624.32" dur="3.66">next mechanism or I guess it&apos;s an</text><text start="7626.239" dur="5.4">attribute of mechanisms that I want to</text><text start="7627.98" dur="6.119">end on is decentralized identity so</text><text start="7631.639" dur="5.1">basically the promise of decentralized</text><text start="7634.099" dur="4.321">identity is well first off let&apos;s talk</text><text start="7636.739" dur="3.781">about the pitfalls we don&apos;t want to have</text><text start="7638.42" dur="5.52">plutocratic decentralized identity we</text><text start="7640.52" dur="7.32">won&apos;t don&apos;t want to have uh privacy uh</text><text start="7643.94" dur="6.239">privacy leaking or or privacy uh</text><text start="7647.84" dur="4.92">steamrolling uh identity we won&apos;t have</text><text start="7650.179" dur="5.101">Sovereign digital identity but assuming</text><text start="7652.76" dur="4.14">that we have that protected privacy</text><text start="7655.28" dur="3.66">protected from plutocracy that you can</text><text start="7656.9" dur="3.6">take from site to site one of the big</text><text start="7658.94" dur="2.759">opportunities with decentralized</text><text start="7660.5" dur="2.88">identity is that we can now build</text><text start="7661.699" dur="4.02">systems that don&apos;t treat each of their</text><text start="7663.38" dur="4.56">participants as fungible with each other</text><text start="7665.719" dur="3.48">you can basically build mechanisms that</text><text start="7667.94" dur="2.82">are one human one vote which are</text><text start="7669.199" dur="3.241">inherently more democratic right we can</text><text start="7670.76" dur="3.479">go from one token one vote to one human</text><text start="7672.44" dur="3.54">one vote or really anything in between</text><text start="7674.239" dur="3.601">quadratic voting is actually just in</text><text start="7675.98" dur="4.02">between when human ones out and in one</text><text start="7677.84" dur="5.22">token one vote but you know if I wanted</text><text start="7680.0" dur="6.9">to build a um</text><text start="7683.06" dur="5.94">uh if I wanted to build a A system that</text><text start="7686.9" dur="3.299">that treats I don&apos;t know people who have</text><text start="7689.0" dur="2.94">contributed to get coin grants</text><text start="7690.199" dur="4.321">differently or people who have collected</text><text start="7691.94" dur="4.86">a specific Pope differently then I can</text><text start="7694.52" dur="5.46">basically ring fence around those people</text><text start="7696.8" dur="6.06">that mechanism and I think that you know</text><text start="7699.98" dur="4.8">in order to build a more regenerative</text><text start="7702.86" dur="3.779">crypto economic internet there&apos;s</text><text start="7704.78" dur="4.919">actually this idea that we need to be</text><text start="7706.639" dur="5.641">able to have positive some games and uh</text><text start="7709.699" dur="5.341">repeat interactions with each other and</text><text start="7712.28" dur="5.399">so with identity we can accrue positive</text><text start="7715.04" dur="4.74">some reputation and build this virtuous</text><text start="7717.679" dur="3.841">cycle where I&apos;m good to you there&apos;s a</text><text start="7719.78" dur="3.839">verifiable credential that has to do</text><text start="7721.52" dur="5.04">that you&apos;re good with me and that</text><text start="7723.619" dur="4.921">creates trust between the two of us and</text><text start="7726.56" dur="4.559">I think that that&apos;s really an exciting</text><text start="7728.54" dur="4.26">opportunity to complexify the design</text><text start="7731.119" dur="5.1">space of all the mechanisms that we&apos;ve</text><text start="7732.8" dur="5.76">talked about in this episode and</text><text start="7736.219" dur="3.9">um and and I just think that like it</text><text start="7738.56" dur="4.139">just basically makes the design space</text><text start="7740.119" dur="4.741">probably an order of magnitude larger to</text><text start="7742.699" dur="4.561">be able to to drop these little markers</text><text start="7744.86" dur="4.08">of identity and you know maybe this</text><text start="7747.26" dur="2.939">bleeds a little bit into stigma G here</text><text start="7748.94" dur="3.779">like we&apos;re dropping these little little</text><text start="7750.199" dur="4.02">identity markers over time and because</text><text start="7752.719" dur="3.301">of that the system begins to accrue</text><text start="7754.219" dur="3.361">State over time so we can start to</text><text start="7756.02" dur="3.36">identify where the positive sum games</text><text start="7757.58" dur="3.24">are being played and that creates an</text><text start="7759.38" dur="2.759">economic gravity well that brings more</text><text start="7760.82" dur="3.0">people into the positive some games</text><text start="7762.139" dur="3.241">which makes the economic gravity well</text><text start="7763.82" dur="2.7">even bigger which in like the cycle just</text><text start="7765.38" dur="3.0">repeats itself until we have a</text><text start="7766.52" dur="3.06">regenerative crypto economic internet so</text><text start="7768.38" dur="3.359">that&apos;s why I&apos;m really excited about</text><text start="7769.58" dur="5.82">about reputation</text><text start="7771.739" dur="5.88">yeah no totally right yeah civils like</text><text start="7775.4" dur="3.839">we need civil resistance to do half of</text><text start="7777.619" dur="3.961">these things well that we&apos;re actually</text><text start="7779.239" dur="4.681">voting on right how horrible would it be</text><text start="7781.58" dur="5.159">if you do delegation you do a delegated</text><text start="7783.92" dur="4.739">democracy uh kind of approach and like</text><text start="7786.739" dur="4.621">for people that are being receiving</text><text start="7788.659" dur="4.44">votes are actually the same person uh</text><text start="7791.36" dur="4.5">that would be you know it&apos;s just a</text><text start="7793.099" dur="5.341">couple of uh nons but hey this is uh</text><text start="7795.86" dur="4.14">this is really scary it&apos;s it&apos;s crazy how</text><text start="7798.44" dur="3.84">much we&apos;ve gotten done in the Dow space</text><text start="7800.0" dur="4.679">without having something like get corn</text><text start="7802.28" dur="5.76">pass get coin passport really succeeding</text><text start="7804.679" dur="5.04">yet uh because we we need it so bad and</text><text start="7808.04" dur="3.54">there but there&apos;s so many great projects</text><text start="7809.719" dur="4.141">and this is why Bitcoin passport is so</text><text start="7811.58" dur="5.76">cool because there&apos;s bright ID there&apos;s</text><text start="7813.86" dur="6.18">idena there&apos;s uh in three polygon ID is</text><text start="7817.34" dur="4.859">coming through there&apos;s uh what else is</text><text start="7820.04" dur="3.599">there there&apos;s so many uh you would know</text><text start="7822.199" dur="3.241">better like who are all the cool</text><text start="7823.639" dur="5.341">identity projects that are running</text><text start="7825.44" dur="4.92">oh man uh I I don&apos;t want to mention any</text><text start="7828.98" dur="2.759">of them because I might miss some of the</text><text start="7830.36" dur="3.72">good ones and I don&apos;t want to I don&apos;t</text><text start="7831.739" dur="4.261">want to do that but um the uh if you</text><text start="7834.08" dur="3.84">just search the green pill episode</text><text start="7836.0" dur="3.42">history you can see like half the</text><text start="7837.92" dur="3.12">episodes we&apos;ve done are about digital</text><text start="7839.42" dur="3.36">identity so there&apos;s a lot out there</text><text start="7841.04" dur="3.48">yeah and you know they don&apos;t I don&apos;t</text><text start="7842.78" dur="3.0">think I think we get a little bit hung</text><text start="7844.52" dur="4.619">up on oh it needs to be fully</text><text start="7845.78" dur="6.24">decentralized also just having uh real</text><text start="7849.139" dur="5.58">like Central aggregating centralized</text><text start="7852.02" dur="5.82">identity Solutions is also nice you know</text><text start="7854.719" dur="5.46">like uh The Trusted seed is one where we</text><text start="7857.84" dur="5.04">just you know we&apos;ve basically take</text><text start="7860.179" dur="4.261">applications and then like look to make</text><text start="7862.88" dur="3.42">sure that they&apos;re not degens that are</text><text start="7864.44" dur="3.36">just kind of you know gonna receive an</text><text start="7866.3" dur="4.319">airdrop and then dump it or anything</text><text start="7867.8" dur="4.379">like that and and then they become they</text><text start="7870.619" dur="3.421">can become a member of The Trusted seed</text><text start="7872.179" dur="4.261">right and it&apos;s like okay we know you&apos;re</text><text start="7874.04" dur="4.74">a unique individual and and there&apos;s this</text><text start="7876.44" dur="4.92">like qualification and I feel like it</text><text start="7878.78" dur="5.339">would be nice to see uh you know more</text><text start="7881.36" dur="5.359">centralized identity reputation systems</text><text start="7884.119" dur="5.341">out so that we can aggregate them</text><text start="7886.719" dur="6.46">yeah because reputation is so important</text><text start="7889.46" dur="6.42">you know I I feel like a lot of these</text><text start="7893.179" dur="4.861">systems will benefit a lot more if uh</text><text start="7895.88" dur="4.98">you kind of intermix the plutocratic</text><text start="7898.04" dur="5.699">like side of it with something that you</text><text start="7900.86" dur="4.739">know can be earned but not sold you know</text><text start="7903.739" dur="4.141">and uh because there&apos;s so many people</text><text start="7905.599" dur="4.56">are like I have to you know maybe they</text><text start="7907.88" dur="3.96">get paid in GTC but they they need to</text><text start="7910.159" dur="3.421">sell it because you know and so now they</text><text start="7911.84" dur="3.96">don&apos;t have any voting power I mean</text><text start="7913.58" dur="4.68">that&apos;s that&apos;s just a flaw you know and</text><text start="7915.8" dur="5.16">we can do better and I know we will do</text><text start="7918.26" dur="4.919">better uh when we start integrating more</text><text start="7920.96" dur="6.36">when people build more reputation</text><text start="7923.179" dur="6.06">systems that are kind of um cross across</text><text start="7927.32" dur="3.72">across the Dow space not like like</text><text start="7929.239" dur="4.141">there&apos;s reputation systems like for</text><text start="7931.04" dur="4.8">instance giveth has its uh inner give</text><text start="7933.38" dur="3.9">token which is like the if you work for</text><text start="7935.84" dur="3.66">giveth for three months straight then</text><text start="7937.28" dur="4.439">you can become part of the like uh</text><text start="7939.5" dur="4.44">Foundation you could say that manages</text><text start="7941.719" dur="4.321">the treasury to pay the team right so we</text><text start="7943.94" dur="4.44">have like our own internal simple</text><text start="7946.04" dur="4.02">reputation system but that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="7948.38" dur="3.9">really help the space that&apos;s just for</text><text start="7950.06" dur="5.099">our own governance we need more cross</text><text start="7952.28" dur="4.8">functional reputation systems like uh</text><text start="7955.159" dur="3.841">which Bitcoin grants for instance was</text><text start="7957.08" dur="4.2">used heavily for even though it wasn&apos;t</text><text start="7959.0" dur="4.58">made to be a reputation system people</text><text start="7961.28" dur="5.64">were dishing throwing airdrops to donors</text><text start="7963.58" dur="5.92">uh you know because get coin kind of had</text><text start="7966.92" dur="5.219">a civil protection a little bit and it</text><text start="7969.5" dur="4.079">was it was across the space so it had a</text><text start="7972.139" dur="2.94">lot of a lot more validity than</text><text start="7973.579" dur="2.281">something that&apos;s just internal to one</text><text start="7975.079" dur="1.921">project</text><text start="7975.86" dur="2.759">yeah</text><text start="7977.0" dur="3.78">yeah I mean I think there&apos;s so much to</text><text start="7978.619" dur="4.321">say about identity here but and it&apos;s</text><text start="7980.78" dur="5.16">definitely a category of mechanisms not</text><text start="7982.94" dur="5.36">a mechanism it&apos;s itself but</text><text start="7985.94" dur="4.139">um yeah I I</text><text start="7988.3" dur="3.64">there&apos;s probably where we could probably</text><text start="7990.079" dur="3.5">do a whole a whole another episode on</text><text start="7991.94" dur="3.54">identity

dur="3.181">and Facebook because of the sovereignty</text><text start="8033.159" dur="2.821">and privacy and the fact that you can</text><text start="8034.36" dur="3.66">take your social graph from site to site</text><text start="8035.98" dur="3.36">on things like lens and it&apos;s been</text><text start="8038.02" dur="3.059">interesting you know the problem with</text><text start="8039.34" dur="3.54">webcry social is that there&apos;s a network</text><text start="8041.079" dur="2.881">effect that needs to be built all of my</text><text start="8042.88" dur="2.16">friends are on Twitter

start="8046.659" dur="5.58">build that with each with the web3</text><text start="8048.699" dur="6.781">social ecosystem but uh I think that</text><text start="8052.239" dur="5.821">there&apos;s really a lot of opportunity once</text><text start="8055.48" dur="5.52">we&apos;ve got our attention moved away from</text><text start="8058.06" dur="5.46">Twitter and to web3 social what kind of</text><text start="8061.0" dur="5.52">things now that web3 social is out there</text><text start="8063.52" dur="4.5">and we own our own social graph and</text><text start="8066.52" dur="3.54">there&apos;s a forkability of the interface</text><text start="8068.02" dur="5.219">what kind of innovation does that enable</text><text start="8070.06" dur="5.159">and I&apos;ll just I&apos;ll just say I&apos;ll just</text><text start="8073.239" dur="3.48">kind of answer my own question there and</text><text start="8075.219" dur="5.161">just say that I did an early experiment</text><text start="8076.719" dur="5.4">with quadratic funding uh on bitcoin&apos;s</text><text start="8080.38" dur="3.18">news feed which kind of looks like a</text><text start="8082.119" dur="3.301">Twitter news feed we replace the like</text><text start="8083.56" dur="3.119">button because I think that likes are</text><text start="8085.42" dur="3.06">like the ultimate [ __ ] coin right you</text><text start="8086.679" dur="3.601">have unlimited of them and they only</text><text start="8088.48" dur="3.96">measure what gives you a dopamine rush</text><text start="8090.28" dur="3.419">and what we did was we put a micro tip</text><text start="8092.44" dur="4.38">button where you could tip someone 30</text><text start="8093.699" dur="4.801">cents for uh adding value to the network</text><text start="8096.82" dur="2.879">and it turns out no one actually used</text><text start="8098.5" dur="3.98">that because who gives a [ __ ] about 30</text><text start="8099.699" dur="5.04">cents it&apos;s actually even it&apos;s it&apos;s like</text><text start="8102.48" dur="4.179">not even worth the cost basis of like</text><text start="8104.739" dur="3.42">recording that on my taxes but what we</text><text start="8106.659" dur="4.141">did was we were running mini quadratic</text><text start="8108.159" dur="4.141">funding rounds on the get coin news feed</text><text start="8110.8" dur="2.879">we took the same quadratic funding</text><text start="8112.3" dur="4.5">engine on bitcoin grants and we planted</text><text start="8113.679" dur="4.741">it at the get coin news feed and um</text><text start="8116.8" dur="4.2">what that did was I made your 30 cent</text><text start="8118.42" dur="4.259">tip into a ten dollar uh actual yield</text><text start="8121.0" dur="3.179">and and as soon as you&apos;ve done that</text><text start="8122.679" dur="4.081">people are getting rewarded for actually</text><text start="8124.179" dur="4.02">being helpful on the platform and it was</text><text start="8126.76" dur="2.7">a really great way of getting people to</text><text start="8128.199" dur="2.52">just like help out with customer service</text><text start="8129.46" dur="4.139">and answering each other&apos;s questions</text><text start="8130.719" dur="4.38">this mechanism I saw the vibe on the</text><text start="8133.599" dur="4.08">Bitcoin Network I think we did it in</text><text start="8135.099" dur="4.56">January of 2020 this experiment and I</text><text start="8137.679" dur="3.54">saw the vibe of the getcoin network get</text><text start="8139.659" dur="3.241">much more positive and helpful to each</text><text start="8141.219" dur="3.601">other on the news feed because so like</text><text start="8142.9" dur="3.9">that&apos;s an example of like now that lens</text><text start="8144.82" dur="3.6">protocol is out there we could take the</text><text start="8146.8" dur="3.419">decentralized grants protocol and we</text><text start="8148.42" dur="3.659">could build quadratic funding on top of</text><text start="8150.219" dur="3.781">a social network a quadratic funding</text><text start="8152.079" dur="4.5">social network would be a social network</text><text start="8154.0" dur="4.139">that funds the public good and rewards</text><text start="8156.579" dur="3.361">people for being helpful to each other</text><text start="8158.139" dur="4.141">as opposed to just dunking on each other</text><text start="8159.94" dur="4.38">and getting likes because that triggers</text><text start="8162.28" dur="4.68">a dopamine response so the design space</text><text start="8164.32" dur="5.279">of web3 social enables a fractal</text><text start="8166.96" dur="4.02">forkability of innovation on web3</text><text

anyone open source can design</text><text start="8175.179" dur="3.06">mechanisms and that&apos;s the reason why</text><text start="8176.679" dur="3.661">think it&apos;s a collective intelligence</text><text start="8178.239" dur="3.301">tool once it&apos;s out there I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="8180.34" dur="3.6">you have any comments on this Griff that</text><text start="8181.54" dur="4.02">was my little rant on web3 social no I</text><text start="8183.94" dur="3.6">think it&apos;s I think it&apos;s so such a</text><text start="8185.56" dur="4.019">critical piece it&apos;s almost uh it&apos;s like</text><text start="8187.54" dur="4.079">taking identity to the next level where</text><text start="8189.579" dur="5.64">where now you have the social graph on</text><text start="8191.619" dur="6.36">with it and yeah I I can&apos;t really not</text><text start="8195.219" dur="5.941">just like say everything you said in 10x</text><text start="8197.979" dur="5.7">because the ability to build on top of</text><text start="8201.16" dur="4.68">like just imagine if you could just use</text><text start="8203.679" dur="3.601">everyone&apos;s Twitter account you know and</text><text start="8205.84" dur="3.36">you could build on top of that social</text><text start="8207.28" dur="4.02">graph how valuable it would be how</text><text start="8209.2" dur="5.399">valuable it would be for the various</text><text start="8211.3" dur="5.82">mechanisms that that we&apos;re creating uh I</text><text start="8214.599" dur="6.3">really hope that some kind of you know</text><text start="8217.12" dur="6.18">web3 native uh social graph exists right</text><text start="8220.899" dur="4.2">now the best we have is ens and people</text><text start="8223.3" dur="4.799">are building off of it and it&apos;s already</text><text start="8225.099" dur="4.681">very useful but it&apos;s not it wasn&apos;t made</text><text start="8228.099" dur="4.201">for that you know it&apos;s not it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="8229.78" dur="6.119">have as much stickiness as as a Twitter</text><text start="8232.3" dur="5.759">or Facebook so when when we have a web 3</text><text start="8235.899" dur="4.5">native social so that hopefully lens</text><text start="8238.059" dur="4.92">because I just I don&apos;t want a new one I</text><text start="8240.399" dur="4.021">just want one I don&apos;t really care uh and</text><text start="8242.979" dur="3.301">this one&apos;s already there and it has</text><text start="8244.42" dur="4.2">seems to have a lot of support building</text><text start="8246.28" dur="4.079">hopefully this will take off and we can</text><text start="8248.62" dur="4.62">there will be so many interesting things</text><text start="8250.359" dur="4.381">that we can build off of it yeah amen oh</text><text start="8253.24" dur="4.859">I think that&apos;s true of all the space but</text><text start="8254.74" dur="5.159">web3 social particularly seems to have a</text><text start="8258.099" dur="3.181">lot of momentum and</text><text start="8259.899" dur="3.421">um you know I just look at like stani</text><text start="8261.28" dur="3.84">who&apos;s who&apos;s working on lens protocol and</text><text start="8263.32" dur="3.6">I think like this guy is clearly on a</text><text start="8265.12" dur="3.899">tear like he founded Ave and he&apos;s like</text><text start="8266.92" dur="3.42">I&apos;m done doing low hanging fruit stuff</text><text start="8269.019" dur="3.361">let me do something that&apos;s going to be</text><text start="8270.34" dur="3.839">truly hard and just like throw</text><text start="8272.38" dur="3.599">everything I got at it and like he&apos;s the</text><text start="8274.179" dur="5.46">founder of Ave right so he&apos;s got lots of</text><text start="8275.979" dur="5.16">capital in in clout and momentum and</text><text start="8279.639" dur="3.661">stuff like that and so building lens</text><text start="8281.139" dur="3.781">protocol is like he&apos;s gonna make it so</text><text start="8283.3" dur="3.24">that anyone can build on top of web3</text><text start="8284.92" dur="3.0">social whereas right now you either have</text><text start="8286.54" dur="3.0">to be Elon Musk or like someone who&apos;s</text><text start="8287.92" dur="3.86">had a previous exit to even give it a</text><text start="8289.54" dur="5.099">shot and so I think the democratization</text><text start="8291.78" dur="4.779">of web3 social but really all of these</text><text start="8294.639" dur="4.741">mechanisms enabled by web3 is what may</text><text start="8296.559" dur="4.681">makes me optimistic yeah I mean we&apos;re</text><text start="8299.38" dur="4.019">just gonna get better you know the our</text><text start="8301.24" dur="5.159">Collective resource allocation has been</text><text start="8303.399" dur="4.921">so boring for the last 200 years it</text><text start="8306.399" dur="4.5">hasn&apos;t really been anything super</text><text start="8308.32" dur="4.56">exciting to come out since you know</text><text start="8310.899" dur="4.921">Bitcoin and web3 kind of entered the</text><text start="8312.88" dur="4.92">scene so uh whatever we&apos;re working on</text><text start="8315.82" dur="4.02">now I mean I love that we just put all</text><text start="8317.8" dur="4.379">these things in one place I I hope that</text><text start="8319.84" dur="3.9">this can be inspiring for someone uh</text><text start="8322.179" dur="3.481">who&apos;s who&apos;s building the space to be</text><text start="8323.74" dur="4.199">like you know what let&apos;s try this for</text><text start="8325.66" dur="5.16">this one or let&apos;s try that maybe I can</text><text start="8327.939" dur="4.861">augment one of the this one and I can</text><text start="8330.82" dur="3.42">add this to it and it&apos;ll actually work</text><text start="8332.8" dur="4.2">you know</text><text start="8334.24" dur="5.699">yeah I mean I think that like</text><text start="8337.0" dur="4.92">The Meta game here is kind of a the</text><text start="8339.939" dur="4.561">Cambrian explosion of the Byzantine</text><text start="8341.92" dur="4.82">General&apos;s problem being solved enabled</text><text start="8344.5"

start="8355.599" dur="3.54">like this iterative evolutionary game</text><text start="8357.46" dur="4.62">where the a bunch of different agents</text><text start="8359.139" dur="4.681">I&apos;m just using agents as like you know a</text><text start="8362.08" dur="3.779">way of saying like people like Mew and</text><text start="8363.82" dur="4.44">me and everyone else who&apos;s in the</text><text

the things that&apos;s really cool</text><text start="8372.88" dur="3.54">to me is like when I take a step back</text><text start="8374.559" dur="4.261">and I like look outside of the ecosystem</text><text start="8376.42" dur="4.38">is the iterative evolutionary game where</text><text start="8378.82" dur="3.3">every bear Market a bunch of projects</text><text start="8380.8" dur="3.299">are going to fail but it&apos;s the ones that</text><text start="8382.12" dur="2.939">make it into the next Market cycle that</text><text start="8384.099" dur="3.12">are going to be like

be</text><text start="8395.02" dur="3.72">another bear Market from there where a</text><text start="8397.359" dur="3.421">bunch of those projects won&apos;t make it so</text><text start="8398.74" dur="3.72">there&apos;s this iterative evolutionary game</text><text start="8400.78" dur="4.199">in which we&apos;re traversing the mechanism</text><text start="8402.46" dur="4.62">design space and and I have this theory</text><text start="8404.979" dur="3.781">that like you cast the dice a thousand</text><text start="8407.08" dur="3.359">times and the Degen projects like the</text><text start="8408.76" dur="3.06">ftxs and the three ACS are just going to</text><text start="8410.439" dur="2.881">implode every single time because</text><text start="8411.82" dur="3.6">they&apos;re degenerate right their resource</text><text start="8413.32" dur="3.48">allocation is not is fragile and it goes</text><text start="8415.42" dur="3.24">down over time and it&apos;s going to be the</text><text start="8416.8" dur="3.54">regen projects that over time that are</text><text start="8418.66" dur="3.9">like long-term greedy that are going to</text><text start="8420.34" dur="3.48">be the ones that win if you you roll a</text><text start="8422.56" dur="2.52">dice a thousand times I think that</text><text start="8423.82" dur="3.36">you&apos;ll get that that outcome each time</text><text start="8425.08" dur="3.72">because these are intrinsic parts of of</text><text start="8427.18" dur="4.679">each of the systems so I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="8428.8" dur="5.88">you have any any feedback on that yeah I</text><text start="8431.859" dur="6.12">mean I 100 agree because in the end like</text><text start="8434.68" dur="4.799">there&apos;s there&apos;s the the djan market is</text><text start="8437.979" dur="3.42">already filled you know the region</text><text start="8439.479" dur="4.321">Market has barely been we&apos;ve barely</text><text start="8441.399" dur="4.621">cracked the surface there&apos;s uh so much</text><text start="8443.8" dur="4.2">more opportunity in in the regen space</text><text start="8446.02" dur="3.959">when governments and non-profits are</text><text start="8448.0" dur="4.74">spending upwards of 25 trillion dollars</text><text start="8449.979" dur="4.681">a year just burning it on trying to

they&apos;re</text><text start="8467.38" dur="4.92">not actually coordinating effectively</text><text start="8468.819" dur="5.401">and with all of these mechanisms uh if</text><text start="8472.3" dur="3.54">if you&apos;re in the Regent space and you</text><text start="8474.22" dur="3.66">start applying some of these into</text><text start="8475.84" dur="4.68">something that was traditionally only</text><text start="8477.88" dur="4.74">Possible only really compete your only</text><text start="8480.52" dur="3.959">competitors are governments and</text><text start="8482.62" dur="4.14">non-profits and you&apos;re you&apos;re taking</text><text start="8484.479" dur="5.581">this this high level approach oh man</text><text start="8486.76" dur="5.04">yeah you&apos;re gonna kill it if FTX goes</text><text start="8490.06" dur="5.22">down people use binance or they use</text><text start="8491.8" dur="5.58">uniswap you know so I feel like there&apos;s</text><text start="8495.28" dur="3.96">just a lot more opportunity in the in</text><text start="8497.38" dur="4.08">the region in the refi space than there</text><text start="8499.24" dur="4.98">is than there is in in the rest of the</text><text start="8501.46" dur="5.7">space anyway yeah I mean I would I would</text><text start="8504.22" dur="4.56">agree that there is a um like there&apos;s</text><text start="8507.16" dur="2.819">more of a blue ocean John power always</text><text start="8508.78" dur="2.64">calls it like you&apos;ve got the red ocean</text><text start="8509.979" dur="3.0">you&apos;ve got the blue ocean the red ocean</text><text start="8511.42" dur="3.36">is already filled with blood and like</text><text start="8512.979" dur="3.42">animals and stuff so there&apos;s less

regen is more</text><text start="8518.859" dur="4.321">of a blue ocean but I actually think</text><text start="8520.72" dur="4.56">that like it&apos;s fundamentally advantaged</text><text
