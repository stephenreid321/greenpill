dur="4.08">you know kick some butt out and sort of</text><text start="235.86" dur="3.299">building this new way of Distributing</text><text start="237.84" dur="2.64">ownership to the people who are creating</text><text start="239.159" dur="3.781">value on the internet</text><text start="240.48" dur="4.02">beautiful uh how many codes were how</text><text start="242.94" dur="3.299">many cohorts have you done and how many</text><text start="244.5" dur="3.9">projects have gone through</text><text start="246.239" dur="5.101">so we are kicking off applications for</text><text start="248.4" dur="4.86">our fifth cohort on Monday August 1st uh</text><text start="251.34" dur="3.119">we&apos;ve worked with about 65 projects so</text><text start="253.26" dur="2.28">far</text><text start="254.459" dur="3.301">um some of those are out in the world</text><text start="255.54" dur="3.599">others are still you know heads down</text><text start="257.76" dur="2.64">building their communities I think</text><text start="259.139" dur="4.081">that&apos;s you know one of the things that</text><text start="260.4" dur="4.38">we really focus on is you know we very</text><text start="263.22" dur="3.3">much don&apos;t want C Club to be a token</text><text start="264.78" dur="4.02">Factory or a community Factory in any</text><text start="266.52" dur="4.14">way we you know play the long game it&apos;s</text><text start="268.8" dur="6.3">one of our core values as to think long</text><text start="270.66" dur="7.56">term and uh have adopted the lfg tag as</text><text start="275.1" dur="4.5">lftg that&apos;s thoughtfully go uh</text><text start="278.22" dur="3.3">because we think there&apos;s just you know</text><text start="279.6" dur="4.099">so so much more value in in sort of</text><text start="281.52" dur="4.44">doing the the hard slow</text><text start="283.699" dur="3.581">non-scalable work that we think</text><text start="285.96" dur="3.6">ultimately creates value in communities</text><text start="287.28" dur="4.74">and and will hopefully be shown in in</text><text start="289.56" dur="3.78">the market as well yeah one of the</text><text start="292.02" dur="3.66">things that I think is so cool about</text><text start="293.34" dur="4.38">seed Club is is it&apos;s kind of like a</text><text start="295.68" dur="3.66">generator function for dials so like in</text><text start="297.72" dur="2.88">in math and computer science a generator</text><text start="299.34" dur="4.799">function is something that generates</text><text start="300.6" dur="4.98">other functions and uh you know I as as</text><text start="304.139" dur="3.0">listeners know I&apos;m really excited about</text><text start="305.58" dur="3.54">impact aisles things that have positive</text><text start="307.139" dur="4.141">externalities for the world and I kind</text><text start="309.12" dur="3.6">of think of seed Club as an impact out</text><text start="311.28" dur="2.88">generator function so you&apos;re kind of</text><text start="312.72" dur="3.96">like generating and spinning out or</text><text start="314.16" dur="4.5">accelerating impact dials is that a fair</text><text start="316.68" dur="3.66">framing for for what you&apos;re doing</text><text start="318.66" dur="4.08">yeah I think we you know it&apos;s like a</text><text start="320.34" dur="4.38">network of networks in many ways I get</text><text start="322.74" dur="3.12">really excited by the idea that some of</text><text start="324.72" dur="3.18">the projects that we get to work with</text><text start="325.86" dur="4.679">will be far bigger and more popular than</text><text start="327.9" dur="4.26">than C Club itself in the future and I</text><text start="330.539" dur="3.901">think when we start to see you know</text><text start="332.16" dur="3.78">we&apos;ve done four cohorts so far over 65</text><text start="334.44" dur="3.78">projects that are out in the world I</text><text start="335.94" dur="4.02">just sort of think ahead three four five</text><text start="338.22" dur="3.66">ten twenty years into the future and</text><text start="339.96" dur="3.299">think about the impact of those networks</text><text start="341.88" dur="3.84">on the other networks that they end up</text><text start="343.259" dur="4.861">creating it&apos;s I think a really exciting</text><text start="345.72" dur="4.8">web that that gets created there and you</text><text start="348.12" dur="4.68">know there&apos;s there&apos;s no shortage of big</text><text start="350.52" dur="3.959">hairy open questions around how to go do</text><text start="352.8" dur="3.3">these things well and I know you and</text><text start="354.479" dur="3.421">your listeners are well aware of that</text><text start="356.1" dur="3.18">and you know I think the idea of</text><text start="357.9" dur="3.78">building together and being a part of a</text><text start="359.28" dur="4.199">community that&apos;s all focused on pushing</text><text start="361.68" dur="3.48">at their own unique edges but you know</text><text start="363.479" dur="3.541">sharing their their learnings back and</text><text start="365.16" dur="3.599">having sort of this incentive and</text><text start="367.02" dur="3.959">ownership mechanism that that ties</text><text start="368.759" dur="4.081">people together is what would I get</text><text start="370.979" dur="3.301">really excited about I mean for me the</text><text start="372.84" dur="3.84">whole thing that pulled me into this</text><text start="374.28" dur="3.9">space in the first place was it was</text><text start="376.68" dur="3.66">really early into social media and saw</text><text start="378.18" dur="4.139">the value is being created in this web 2</text><text start="380.34" dur="3.84">world and and also saw the early</text><text start="382.319" dur="3.781">negative impacts of that not only just</text><text start="384.18" dur="3.84">sort of the social impacts but also that</text><text start="386.1" dur="3.78">as creators people who are investing in</text><text start="388.02" dur="4.739">creating value in these networks so we</text><text start="389.88" dur="4.62">had no say and and were creating profit</text><text start="392.759" dur="4.741">for the centralized entities and so</text><text start="394.5" dur="5.1">tokens as ownership you know mechanisms</text><text start="397.5" dur="4.5">and networks I think is the use case for</text><text start="399.6" dur="3.719">web3 and when you start to sort of step</text><text start="402.0" dur="2.699">out into that</text><text start="403.319" dur="4.141">um you realize there&apos;s like a whole lot</text><text start="404.699" dur="4.861">of open questions there and so we wanted</text><text start="407.46" dur="4.26">to go figure out how to answer those</text><text start="409.56" dur="3.66">questions uncover new questions so I</text><text start="411.72" dur="3.84">often refer to C clubs as a sense making</text><text start="413.22" dur="3.9">Network it&apos;s the most valuable asset I</text><text start="415.56" dur="3.3">have in the world is just the amazing</text><text start="417.12" dur="4.019">people that will take my call and reply</text><text start="418.86" dur="4.98">to my DMs and sort of formalizing that</text><text start="421.139" dur="4.321">and hoping to yeah turn that into that</text><text start="423.84" dur="3.66">generator function that continues to</text><text start="425.46" dur="3.72">generate insights for brilliant human</text><text start="427.5" dur="3.6">beings who are investing their</text><text start="429.18" dur="4.859">heartbeats into you know things they</text><text start="431.1" dur="4.92">deeply care about yeah yeah I think that</text><text start="434.039" dur="4.321">you know one of the the neatest things</text><text start="436.02" dur="4.44">that happens in this space over time is</text><text start="438.36" dur="4.739">the relationships that you develop with</text><text start="440.46" dur="4.92">people who are geographically diverse</text><text start="443.099" dur="5.701">and skill wise diverse and in a bunch of</text><text start="445.38" dur="4.98">different niches and can can sort of</text><text start="448.8" dur="3.48">advise you on what you&apos;re building and</text><text start="450.36" dur="5.22">it&apos;s a very positive sum relationship</text><text start="452.28" dur="5.58">over time and you know I&apos;m wondering you</text><text start="455.58" dur="4.08">know have you have you actually</text><text start="457.86" dur="3.839">have the people that have gone through</text><text start="459.66" dur="3.0">seed Club help you build seed club like</text><text start="461.699" dur="2.461">you said it&apos;s like a sense making</text><text start="462.66" dur="2.879">Network so are you in this like ooda</text><text start="464.16" dur="3.06">Loop where where they&apos;re helping you</text><text start="465.539" dur="4.141">build the next cohort</text><text start="467.22" dur="3.84">yeah 100 I mean we sort of think that</text><text start="469.68" dur="2.579">the core mechanisms we&apos;re designing for</text><text start="471.06" dur="2.579">is bringing great people and great</text><text start="472.259" dur="2.821">projects together</text><text start="473.639" dur="3.241">um yeah we&apos;re opening applications on</text><text start="475.08" dur="3.66">Monday which is our process of involving</text><text start="476.88" dur="4.02">our community and helping to</text><text start="478.74" dur="3.899">you know curate decide choose which the</text><text start="480.9" dur="3.48">which projects join for our next cohort</text><text start="482.639" dur="3.541">so our token holders have a big uh</text><text start="484.38" dur="3.599">impact on that but the other side of</text><text start="486.18" dur="3.72">that is our collaborator Network so</text><text start="487.979" dur="4.081">these are folks who have deep experience</text><text start="489.9" dur="5.1">in the web 3 space or in certain aspects</text><text start="492.06" dur="4.199">of you know organization building and um</text><text start="495.0" dur="3.06">you know we sort of bring those folks</text><text start="496.259" dur="4.321">together through the the 12-week program</text><text start="498.06" dur="4.74">that is the C Club accelerator so very</text><text start="500.58" dur="4.26">much that collaborator group is</text><text start="502.8" dur="4.679">increasingly being made up of folks who</text><text start="504.84" dur="4.32">have are alumni who are out there you</text><text start="507.479" dur="3.541">know learning the the Contemporary</text><text start="509.16" dur="3.66">lessons that you can only learn by</text><text start="511.02" dur="5.639">building at the edges and you know</text><text start="512.82" dur="5.159">there&apos;s I mean I mean c-clip launched</text><text start="516.659" dur="3.3">almost two years ago and I think about</text><text start="517.979" dur="4.98">just the number of narrative switches</text><text start="519.959" dur="4.2">new token models like you know different</text><text start="522.959" dur="3.181">ways that we actually launch these</text><text start="524.159" dur="3.901">things and I think it&apos;s you know in no</text><text start="526.14" dur="3.84">way are we becoming more and more clear</text><text start="528.06" dur="4.2">I think there&apos;s more more Innovation and</text><text start="529.98" dur="3.72">uh ideas and experiments that will be</text><text start="532.26" dur="2.94">run and so those people who are running</text><text start="533.7" dur="3.0">those experiments are by far the best</text><text start="535.2" dur="4.079">folks to help guide the next batch of</text><text start="536.7" dur="4.68">projects yeah it&apos;s really amazing what a</text><text start="539.279" dur="3.781">cohort based model can do I actually got</text><text start="541.38" dur="5.459">my start building startups going through</text><text start="543.06" dur="5.219">Tech Stars in 2008 and just going</text><text start="546.839" dur="4.021">through in a cohort based model and</text><text start="548.279" dur="3.781">learning about startups together and you</text><text start="550.86" dur="3.599">know some of those people are still some</text><text start="552.06" dur="3.66">of my best friends almost 15 years later</text><text start="554.459" dur="3.601">and so</text><text start="555.72" dur="3.84">um I&apos;ve seen the power of of of that</text><text start="558.06" dur="3.779">sort of model and now I&apos;m wondering how</text><text start="559.56" dur="5.52">you can compare and contrast seed Club</text><text start="561.839" dur="6.241">to more web 2 type things like techstars</text><text start="565.08" dur="4.319">or 500 startups or YC</text><text start="568.08" dur="3.06">yeah I think there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="569.399" dur="3.0">similarities right like the cohort model</text><text start="571.14" dur="3.12">being able to bring folks together</text><text start="572.399" dur="3.421">supporting them through you know the</text><text start="574.26" dur="3.66">network that gets developed in in those</text><text start="575.82" dur="4.019">types of organizations I like to frame</text><text start="577.92" dur="3.84">it as you know techstars y combinator</text><text start="579.839" dur="4.201">are like perfect examples of running</text><text start="581.76" dur="3.9">accelerators as a firm and what C Club</text><text start="584.04" dur="3.799">wants to build is the accelerator as a</text><text start="585.66" dur="4.799">network and where you know we&apos;re</text><text start="587.839" dur="4.961">recognizing sort of ownership and</text><text start="590.459" dur="4.5">governance in the network through</text><text start="592.8" dur="3.78">um through our token and so like the the</text><text start="594.959" dur="4.201">basic sort of</text><text start="596.58" dur="3.96">I guess the deal that the teams enter</text><text start="599.16" dur="2.64">into when they join C Club is they</text><text start="600.54" dur="4.02">contribute three percent of their tokens</text><text start="601.8" dur="4.56">to the C Club Dow and once they complete</text><text start="604.56" dur="3.54">the program and launch their tokens they</text><text start="606.36" dur="3.36">do get a grant of Club tokens back as</text><text start="608.1" dur="4.2">well and so we&apos;re sort of the lining</text><text start="609.72" dur="4.14">incentives over the long term here where</text><text start="612.3" dur="3.06">um you know c-club has this incentive to</text><text start="613.86" dur="3.18">not just support server accelerator but</text><text start="615.36" dur="3.24">to help these projects grow we have a</text><text start="617.04" dur="3.479">whole cultivation working group that</text><text start="618.6" dur="3.54">takes uh those projects that have</text><text start="620.519" dur="3.181">launched and are about to launch as they</text><text start="622.14" dur="3.36">leave the accelerator and help support</text><text start="623.7" dur="3.84">it with legal a fundraising and token</text><text start="625.5" dur="3.06">design and organizational development</text><text start="627.54" dur="2.94">Etc</text><text start="628.56" dur="3.719">um and then of course the the people who</text><text start="630.48" dur="3.359">are in those projects become Governors</text><text start="632.279" dur="2.521">and owners in the C club network as well</text><text start="633.839" dur="2.521">and</text><text start="634.8" dur="3.0">um you know not only have like the</text><text start="636.36" dur="2.76">social capital alignment or the</text><text start="637.8" dur="3.0">intrinsic alignment of wanting to see</text><text start="639.12" dur="5.399">more of these things work and succeed</text><text start="640.8" dur="5.76">but also have you know a true say in how</text><text start="644.519" dur="3.721">and what we do so I guess like</text><text start="646.56" dur="3.12">meaningfully we don&apos;t invest Capital</text><text start="648.24" dur="3.06">into these projects which I think is</text><text start="649.68" dur="2.76">sort of like the other big difference</text><text start="651.3" dur="2.099">and</text><text start="652.44" dur="3.54">um you know it&apos;s definitely something</text><text start="653.399" dur="4.62">that we continue to think about but what</text><text start="655.98" dur="3.84">I like so much space is that the first</text><text start="658.019" dur="2.94">conversation when you&apos;re starting a</text><text start="659.82" dur="2.639">startup like often the first</text><text start="660.959" dur="3.241">conversation is how do I go get a</text><text start="662.459" dur="3.961">pre-seed investment I need money how to</text><text start="664.2" dur="4.56">go get money I think in web3 we have so</text><text start="666.42" dur="4.2">many new tools that exist to help build</text><text start="668.76" dur="3.6">that early Capital base whether that is</text><text start="670.62" dur="3.54">financial or Social Capital as well and</text><text start="672.36" dur="4.44">and those conversations should start a</text><text start="674.16" dur="5.1">lot sooner so while we do very actively</text><text start="676.8" dur="4.26">support teams and and raising funds or</text><text start="679.26" dur="4.019">or you know generating capital for for</text><text start="681.06" dur="4.8">their Dow they have many more tools so</text><text start="683.279" dur="4.68">whether that&apos;s a crowdfund or an nft</text><text start="685.86" dur="3.599">collection or traditional you know</text><text start="687.959" dur="3.181">Venture Capital</text><text start="689.459" dur="3.06">um going in knowing you have options I</text><text start="691.14" dur="3.66">think is important</text><text start="692.519" dur="4.801">right yeah</text><text start="694.8" dur="4.38">um you know I&apos;m wondering</text><text start="697.32" dur="3.959">okay so we&apos;ll actually let me set an</text><text start="699.18" dur="4.32">object level uh question and then we can</text><text start="701.279" dur="3.421">we can we can get weird uh after that</text><text start="703.5" dur="3.12">but like what kind of person should</text><text start="704.7" dur="3.6">apply for the next seed Club cohort and</text><text start="706.62" dur="3.12">I think you said applications are are on</text><text start="708.3" dur="3.36">Monday where can they go to apply and</text><text start="709.74" dur="5.279">who should who should consider applying</text><text start="711.66" dur="5.58">yeah so accelerator.c club.xyz or give</text><text start="715.019" dur="4.5">us a follow on Twitter we&apos;ll be sharing</text><text start="717.24" dur="3.24">that equate uh often I think over the</text><text start="719.519" dur="2.461">next while</text><text start="720.48" dur="3.0">um you know I think we&apos;re really</text><text start="721.98" dur="3.359">interested in the intersection of tokens</text><text start="723.48" dur="4.979">and communities so you know web3</text><text start="725.339" dur="5.401">communities tokenized communities Dows</text><text start="728.459" dur="3.601">um we sort of stay away from the deep D5</text><text start="730.74" dur="3.599">space as I think they&apos;re sort of</text><text start="732.06" dur="3.959">specific knowledge that&apos;s you know best</text><text start="734.339" dur="3.361">suited to be driven by folks who are</text><text start="736.019" dur="3.661">those Builders but you know the the</text><text start="737.7" dur="3.42">community and culture aspect is a big</text><text start="739.68" dur="3.719">open space that I think has proven out</text><text start="741.12" dur="4.14">to be uh you know rich with opportunity</text><text start="743.399" dur="4.861">over the last two years and and that&apos;s</text><text start="745.26" dur="5.94">really where we play so I mean we see</text><text start="748.26" dur="5.699">um folks who are launching communities</text><text start="751.2" dur="4.74">um Service devs uh a number of the</text><text start="753.959" dur="4.201">probably the biggest increases in tools</text><text start="755.94" dur="4.139">and platforms focused on on sort of the</text><text start="758.16" dur="3.419">Dow and Community token space</text><text start="760.079" dur="3.181">um and so we have wonderful projects</text><text start="761.579" dur="4.26">like Cali Dao and Mirage they&apos;re</text><text start="763.26" dur="4.22">building more of the tooling layer and</text><text start="765.839" dur="4.8">then we&apos;re seeing a big interest in in</text><text start="767.48" dur="5.5">DSi projects big interest in around sort</text><text start="770.639" dur="6.361">of this like co-creation of narratives</text><text start="772.98" dur="5.34">and IP and CCO and I think what excites</text><text start="777.0" dur="3.3">me so much about how we structured C</text><text start="778.32" dur="4.38">Club is that we don&apos;t have to have the</text><text start="780.3" dur="3.599">strongest opinion on what will work</text><text start="782.7" dur="2.879">um really what we&apos;re looking for is</text><text start="783.899" dur="3.421">interested passionate folks who want to</text><text start="785.579" dur="3.481">you know invest in our heartbeats and in</text><text start="787.32" dur="2.759">building something meaningful and the</text><text start="789.06" dur="2.82">core thing that we&apos;re looking for is</text><text start="790.079" dur="3.541">folks who want to give ownership to</text><text start="791.88" dur="3.66">their community so if you&apos;re wanting to</text><text start="793.62" dur="4.8">go build you know a central entity that</text><text start="795.54" dur="3.84">launches Collectibles and and it is sort</text><text start="798.42" dur="2.4">of structured in a way that It</text><text start="799.38" dur="2.759">ultimately will lead to more value</text><text start="800.82" dur="3.9">extraction from the community it&apos;s</text><text start="802.139" dur="4.14">probably not a good fit for us we think</text><text start="804.72" dur="3.059">tokens give ownership in communities or</text><text start="806.279" dur="3.36">or networks and those are the types of</text><text start="807.779" dur="4.62">projects that we want to back</text><text start="809.639" dur="4.021">yeah amazing um you know one of the</text><text start="812.399" dur="2.281">things that sort of triggered for me</text><text start="813.66" dur="2.7">when you were saying that is I remember</text><text start="814.68" dur="3.48">in techstars some of the most successful</text><text start="816.36" dur="3.479">tech service projects were things that</text><text start="818.16" dur="3.72">came in and built for the techstars</text><text start="819.839" dur="3.901">network uh that helped them move faster</text><text start="821.88" dur="3.78">and so send grid was the first tech</text><text start="823.74" dur="3.719">Stars thing that ipo&apos;d and it&apos;s because</text><text start="825.66" dur="3.419">they made sending I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="827.459" dur="3.12">anyone&apos;s ever set up an SMTP server</text><text start="829.079" dur="3.661">which is the email protocol but it&apos;s a</text><text start="830.579" dur="3.781"> nightmare and sendra just made</text><text start="832.74" dur="2.88">you like ability to do it in one line of</text><text start="834.36" dur="2.88">code and their first customers were all</text><text start="835.62" dur="3.54">techstars cohorts and so it&apos;s</text><text start="837.24" dur="3.719">interesting to me that a growing part of</text><text start="839.16" dur="3.96">what you&apos;re seeing in C Club is kind of</text><text start="840.959" dur="4.261">like Dao tooling uh and I&apos;m wondering</text><text start="843.12" dur="4.32">like what kind of cross-pollinations are</text><text start="845.22" dur="3.299">going to happen at scale at seed Club I</text><text start="847.44" dur="2.88">don&apos;t know if that triggers anything for</text><text start="848.519" dur="4.021">you but that&apos;s what it triggered for me</text><text start="850.32" dur="5.459">yeah I mean I think it&apos;s</text><text start="852.54" dur="4.799">um it&apos;s interesting because you know we</text><text start="855.779" dur="3.18">do see so many interesting projects that</text><text start="857.339" dur="3.18">come through and and some some that some</text><text start="858.959" dur="3.541">of those are applying for C Club others</text><text start="860.519" dur="3.361">are you know building tools for C club</text><text start="862.5" dur="2.82">projects but there&apos;s a very big</text><text start="863.88" dur="3.3">difference between</text><text start="865.32" dur="3.3">you know say tool Builders who have are</text><text start="867.18" dur="2.94">building to solve a problem that they</text><text start="868.62" dur="3.42">have faced in a Dao or a community</text><text start="870.12" dur="3.719">themselves versus two builders that are</text><text start="872.04" dur="3.66">trying to build</text><text start="873.839" dur="4.081">what ultimately feels more like a SAS or</text><text start="875.7" dur="4.86">a product for for Dallas without having</text><text start="877.92" dur="4.74">maybe that intimate understanding of the</text><text start="880.56" dur="3.779">the biggest challenges that exist there</text><text start="882.66" dur="3.9">and so when you end up there is like</text><text start="884.339" dur="5.221">with all is a lot of like all-in-one Dow</text><text start="886.56" dur="4.38">tools or you know there&apos;s no no mystery</text><text start="889.56" dur="4.019">that if you look at the user experience</text><text start="890.94" dur="4.68">and participating in Dallas right now</text><text start="893.579" dur="3.301">it&apos;s it&apos;s can look from the outside like</text><text start="895.62" dur="2.82">rather horrendous there&apos;s a whole bunch</text><text start="896.88" dur="2.639">of tools and mechanisms that are being</text><text start="898.44" dur="2.699">brought together and it feels like</text><text start="899.519" dur="3.301">you&apos;re spread out over across a bunch of</text><text start="901.139" dur="4.681">different platforms</text><text start="902.82" dur="4.259">um but you know there&apos;s the reality for</text><text start="905.82" dur="3.12">Builders who are building in the space</text><text start="907.079" dur="3.241">is that there&apos;s just so much uncertainty</text><text start="908.94" dur="2.699">about the future and that you know</text><text start="910.32" dur="3.0">making bets on these all-in-one</text><text start="911.639" dur="3.421">platforms or these tools that are</text><text start="913.32" dur="2.94">requiring more of a lock-in or big</text><text start="915.06" dur="2.88">decisions from Dallas that ultimately</text><text start="916.26" dur="5.759">limit their optionality in the future is</text><text start="917.94" dur="6.899">just not super appealing and so what I&apos;m</text><text start="922.019" dur="4.44">most excited about is seeing the types</text><text start="924.839" dur="3.661">of tools that are actually being built</text><text start="926.459" dur="4.141">either alongside our Dows and then</text><text start="928.5" dur="3.6">probably even more so about the Dows</text><text start="930.6" dur="3.0">themselves building the tools that will</text><text start="932.1" dur="3.06">ultimately you know solve their problems</text><text start="933.6" dur="3.599">and so so I look into the market of</text><text start="935.16" dur="4.88">successful versions of this it&apos;s noses</text><text start="937.199" dur="5.161">safe it&apos;s coordinate you know these are</text><text start="940.04" dur="3.7">Builders Dows who have been able to come</text><text start="942.36" dur="4.38">together bring the social and financial</text><text start="943.74" dur="4.68">Capital together discover issues in</text><text start="946.74" dur="3.779">their operations and have generalized a</text><text start="948.42" dur="3.3">product that we think will sort of you</text><text start="950.519" dur="3.781">know be make it easier for other</text><text start="951.72" dur="4.38">builders to do and so this like deep</text><text start="954.3" dur="3.3">collaboration and understanding of the</text><text start="956.1" dur="3.96">problem space I think is absolutely</text><text start="957.6" dur="4.2">essential and my bet is very much that</text><text start="960.06" dur="3.3">the most interesting useful mechanisms</text><text start="961.8" dur="3.599">tools platforms are going to come from</text><text start="963.36" dur="3.539">these communities rather than be built</text><text start="965.399" dur="4.8">from just the outside with the</text><text start="966.899" dur="4.56">Assumption of you know uh it is the</text><text start="970.199" dur="3.241">you&apos;re looking at Dows as if they&apos;re</text><text start="971.459" dur="4.261">just Enterprises rather than these sort</text><text start="973.44" dur="4.019">of organisms that have acknowledged</text><text start="975.72" dur="3.419">Insight talent and capital to go build</text><text start="977.459" dur="3.421">cool things themselves</text><text start="979.139" dur="4.14">yeah</text><text start="980.88" dur="5.04">so it&apos;s just so interesting um well you</text><text start="983.279" dur="3.961">know one of my favorite moments it just</text><text start="985.92" dur="2.76">having been involved in Bitcoin for</text><text start="987.24" dur="3.659">years is when people come up to me and</text><text start="988.68" dur="5.399">they say hey like y&apos;all materially</text><text start="990.899" dur="5.461">change the course of my career or helped</text><text start="994.079" dur="4.2">me in some way and uh it&apos;s just like</text><text start="996.36" dur="3.96">it&apos;s like the golden retriever I mean</text><text start="998.279" dur="3.841">it&apos;s like it feels like a good boy uh</text><text start="1000.32" dur="3.72">and I you know I&apos;m curious you know with</text><text start="1002.12" dur="3.839">the Alumni network if if you have any of</text><text start="1004.04" dur="4.02">those moments and and if that drives you</text><text start="1005.959" dur="4.5">in any way like that network network</text><text start="1008.06" dur="5.639">approach to helping each other out</text><text start="1010.459" dur="4.62">yeah and it was I get to spend my days</text><text start="1013.699" dur="3.541">talking to brilliant people who are</text><text start="1015.079" dur="4.081">trying to solve big problems towards you</text><text start="1017.24" dur="3.48">know a thing they care deeply about and</text><text start="1019.16" dur="3.84">you know I get to have that feeling</text><text start="1020.72" dur="3.42">pretty much every day which is like you</text><text start="1023.0" dur="4.38">know probably the biggest blessing</text><text start="1024.14" dur="5.4">around and for me like I&apos;m so fascinated</text><text start="1027.38" dur="5.4">about exploring the edges and new ideas</text><text start="1029.54" dur="6.299">and uh you know I think up until sea</text><text start="1032.78" dur="4.919">club which feels just like a you know</text><text start="1035.839" dur="3.6">crazy experience it just it came out of</text><text start="1037.699" dur="3.901">11 people on a telegram and just built</text><text start="1039.439" dur="4.081">this momentum and and to be able to get</text><text start="1041.6" dur="3.78">to do have this thing structured in such</text><text start="1043.52" dur="4.319">a way where I get to go do you know work</text><text start="1045.38" dur="3.9">with such smart people who are dealing</text><text start="1047.839" dur="4.021">with the biggest challenge like the big</text><text start="1049.28" dur="4.139">challenges get you know is what I get</text><text start="1051.86" dur="2.939">brought into and what you know our</text><text start="1053.419" dur="3.241">support network and C Club get brought</text><text start="1054.799" dur="3.781">into and you know those are everything</text><text start="1056.66" dur="3.24">from you know how are we design our</text><text start="1058.58" dur="3.54">token and thinking about capitalizing</text><text start="1059.9" dur="3.899">the organization to you know managing</text><text start="1062.12" dur="3.72">interpersonal relationships and</text><text start="1063.799" dur="4.081">Community structures and you know how</text><text start="1065.84" dur="3.959">how do you actually focus a group of</text><text start="1067.88" dur="3.96">people on on a big goal and get</text><text start="1069.799" dur="3.601">alignment there and and these are not</text><text start="1071.84" dur="2.94">easy questions and they&apos;re not things</text><text start="1073.4" dur="2.899">that can just be turned into Frameworks</text><text start="1074.78" dur="4.44">and templates and just be you know</text><text start="1076.299" dur="4.721">successfully applied easily and</text><text start="1079.22" dur="5.52">yeah there&apos;s nothing I&apos;d rather be</text><text start="1081.02" dur="6.48">spending my time on yeah it&apos;s beautiful</text><text start="1084.74" dur="4.98">um I guess I&apos;m curious you know you said</text><text start="1087.5" dur="5.4">you like to kind of be at the edges and</text><text start="1089.72" dur="4.62">and be in the frontier and and and bring</text><text start="1092.9" dur="3.24">those things back I&apos;m curious what what</text><text start="1094.34" dur="3.959">are you most interested in trendwise</text><text start="1096.14" dur="3.419">right now you know take me down a weird</text><text start="1098.299" dur="3.181">rabbit hole</text><text start="1099.559" dur="4.021">well I mean I think like there&apos;s been a</text><text start="1101.48" dur="4.319">lot of learning around what is the right</text><text start="1103.58" dur="3.78">Community token structure to sort of</text><text start="1105.799" dur="3.661">launch with or for the early days and I</text><text start="1107.36" dur="4.02">think you know a year and a half ago</text><text start="1109.46" dur="3.78">that was fungible tokens and you know</text><text start="1111.38" dur="3.72">both C club and Bitcoin I think in</text><text start="1113.24" dur="3.24">different but similar ways sort of</text><text start="1115.1" dur="3.9">launch tokens</text><text start="1116.48" dur="4.92">um for Dows that were sort of based on</text><text start="1119.0" dur="5.52">on this model of fungible tokens and</text><text start="1121.4" dur="4.8">investing and distributions and Etc and</text><text start="1124.52" dur="4.32">then I think you know with nfts taking</text><text start="1126.2" dur="4.8">such a an increase in interest over the</text><text start="1128.84" dur="4.02">last you know eight months to 12 months</text><text start="1131.0" dur="4.02">that a whole bunch of new experiments</text><text start="1132.86" dur="4.14">were being run and so I think our our</text><text start="1135.02" dur="4.019">most you know if we look it back to our</text><text start="1137.0" dur="3.36">third cohort I would say 90 of projects</text><text start="1139.039" dur="3.481">we&apos;re exploring launching fungible</text><text start="1140.36" dur="4.26">tokens and then our fifth cohort that&apos;s</text><text start="1142.52" dur="4.14">flipped so 90 of them are exploring</text><text start="1144.62" dur="3.48">launching nfts and I think there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="1146.66" dur="3.54">of insight in there especially for the</text><text start="1148.1" dur="4.02">earliest days of communities I think</text><text start="1150.2" dur="4.26">part of that is this idea of sort of</text><text start="1152.12" dur="4.919">ownership in a brand or a meme is is</text><text start="1154.46" dur="4.2">more tangible and easy to understand</text><text start="1157.039" dur="3.181">um reduces some of the the challenges</text><text start="1158.66" dur="3.54">around liquidity because both allowing</text><text start="1160.22" dur="3.66">for tokens to have a market but not a</text><text start="1162.2" dur="3.18">crazy big market and not requiring teams</text><text start="1163.88" dur="3.96">to spend a lot of time and effort on</text><text start="1165.38" dur="3.84">standing up uniswap pools there&apos;s sort</text><text start="1167.84" dur="3.06">of this programmatic Revenue that can</text><text start="1169.22" dur="3.72">come back to it and and there&apos;s this</text><text start="1170.9" dur="4.26">cultural aspect this sort of uh identity</text><text start="1172.94" dur="3.84">that was really seen take Center Stage</text><text start="1175.16" dur="4.259">over the last few months that I think is</text><text start="1176.78" dur="3.899">is also interesting so I think that&apos;s</text><text start="1179.419" dur="3.241">the thing we&apos;re thinking most about</text><text start="1180.679" dur="3.541">right now is what are the the types and</text><text start="1182.66" dur="3.66">structures that will really support our</text><text start="1184.22" dur="4.62">communities at the earliest stages to to</text><text start="1186.32" dur="5.04">like you know rally their community and</text><text start="1188.84" dur="4.14">to you know distribute ownership and</text><text start="1191.36" dur="3.96">then how to do that in the in a way that</text><text start="1192.98" dur="5.16">is both provide a lot of optionality for</text><text start="1195.32" dur="4.8">the future but you know taking bold step</text><text start="1198.14" dur="3.779">forwards with a strong belief on what a</text><text start="1200.12" dur="4.559">good good enough token model is for for</text><text start="1201.919" dur="4.561">teams right now so I think you know the</text><text start="1204.679" dur="3.541">probably the most interesting project in</text><text start="1206.48" dur="3.78">this direction right now is is nouns and</text><text start="1208.22" dur="3.18">in that Perpetual auction mechanism I</text><text start="1210.26" dur="2.94">think there&apos;s going to be a lot of</text><text start="1211.4" dur="3.899">exploration in that over the next little</text><text start="1213.2" dur="3.24">while I think a lot more failure than</text><text start="1215.299" dur="2.521">successes</text><text start="1216.44" dur="4.08">um and teams that are able to sort of</text><text start="1217.82" dur="4.56">figure out what those uh you know pull</text><text start="1220.52" dur="3.42">apart the aspects that make the now</text><text start="1222.38" dur="3.299">Niche model successful and apply to</text><text start="1223.94" dur="4.32">their their use case effectively is</text><text start="1225.679" dur="4.141">definitely something we&apos;re interested in</text><text start="1228.26" dur="4.08">um but we see it you know the other two</text><text start="1229.82" dur="4.5">big groups or nfts Dow tokens so just</text><text start="1232.34" dur="3.54">more you know having a traditional</text><text start="1234.32" dur="3.66">structure for for a dow token but using</text><text start="1235.88" dur="3.9">nfts instead of your c20s or fungible</text><text start="1237.98" dur="3.96">tokens and then there&apos;s this big Middle</text><text start="1239.78" dur="3.36">Ground around membership and membership</text><text start="1241.94" dur="3.119">passes</text><text start="1243.14" dur="3.72">Etc that sort of creates interesting new</text><text start="1245.059" dur="4.141">Revenue sources and and governance</text><text start="1246.86" dur="3.6">opportunities as well so I think you</text><text start="1249.2" dur="3.66">know we&apos;ll be leaning pretty heavily</text><text start="1250.46" dur="4.079">into that for this next cohort uh we</text><text start="1252.86" dur="4.08">have fairly strong opinions I think for</text><text start="1254.539" dur="4.321">the first four cohorts we&apos;ve really</text><text start="1256.94" dur="3.599">tried not to to come up with Frameworks</text><text start="1258.86" dur="3.84">or strong recommendations we were still</text><text start="1260.539" dur="3.901">still we&apos;re and I think we still are in</text><text start="1262.7" dur="3.359">this sort of you know idmas right now</text><text start="1264.44" dur="4.08">and and really like to see many many</text><text start="1266.059" dur="4.081">different options and my dream is that</text><text start="1268.52" dur="3.3">some new token model comes out of C club</text><text start="1270.14" dur="3.3">that takes the World by storm so we</text><text start="1271.82" dur="3.78">don&apos;t want to just be too too focused</text><text start="1273.44" dur="4.02">but for many communities that have</text><text start="1275.6" dur="3.36">something that&apos;s pretty clear like in</text><text start="1277.46" dur="3.0">their mind that you know the removing</text><text start="1278.96" dur="3.06">some of the uncertainty around what</text><text start="1280.46" dur="3.24">Frameworks can get them from zero to one</text><text start="1282.02" dur="4.08">is super powerful</text><text start="1283.7" dur="4.52">so I guess you know I&apos;m curious to pull</text><text start="1286.1" dur="4.68">the thread on this like I think in web 2</text><text start="1288.22" dur="5.319">basically there was two models that</text><text start="1290.78" dur="5.279">everything converged on and one was you</text><text start="1293.539" dur="4.441">sell your users data to advertisers and</text><text start="1296.059" dur="3.901">you just optimize for page views and</text><text start="1297.98" dur="3.48">clicks that&apos;s one model</text><text start="1299.96" dur="2.94">um the second model is the SAS model</text><text start="1301.46" dur="4.199">which is you try to get as many people</text><text start="1302.9" dur="5.22">into a 9.99 a month or</text><text start="1305.659" dur="4.201">something subscription plan and then you</text><text start="1308.12" dur="4.02">optimize for lifetime value reduce cost</text><text start="1309.86" dur="3.72">per acquisition and then you scale and</text><text start="1312.14" dur="3.72">those are basically the two models in</text><text start="1313.58" dur="4.44">web two do you think that the community</text><text start="1315.86" dur="5.939">like the model in web 3 are going to</text><text start="1318.02" dur="7.86">converge on one two three five or like a</text><text start="1321.799" dur="6.481">dozen options or is it too early to say</text><text start="1325.88" dur="4.02">well I think we can see some of that</text><text start="1328.28" dur="3.42">convergence happening right now but I&apos;d</text><text start="1329.9" dur="3.96">also say I think it&apos;s it&apos;s too early to</text><text start="1331.7" dur="4.5">say in many regards</text><text start="1333.86" dur="5.04">um you know I think like this um the</text><text start="1336.2" dur="5.219">idea of ownership or prop like yeah</text><text start="1338.9" dur="4.68">ownership in in the meme or in in the</text><text start="1341.419" dur="4.081">brand I think is is one that has been</text><text start="1343.58" dur="4.8">very powerful so far</text><text start="1345.5" dur="5.28">um so whether that is is nouns or that</text><text start="1348.38" dur="4.26">is you know Aku and sort of the story</text><text start="1350.78" dur="3.6">that&apos;s being built there or or you know</text><text start="1352.64" dur="3.3">this idea of you know pool Suite is a</text><text start="1354.38" dur="2.88">project that we&apos;ve worked with and you</text><text start="1355.94" dur="3.119">know having executive cards that</text><text start="1357.26" dur="3.779">represent sort of membership there</text><text start="1359.059" dur="3.48">um so I think that&apos;s interesting that</text><text start="1361.039" dur="3.0">like how you actually go and turn that</text><text start="1362.539" dur="3.301">into a meaningful token structure or</text><text start="1364.039" dur="4.38">revenue or ongoing</text><text start="1365.84" dur="4.74">um you know Capital creation I think is</text><text start="1368.419" dur="3.361">is the big open question</text><text start="1370.58" dur="3.3">um you know you could look at at</text><text start="1371.78" dur="3.72">projects like proof which and and board</text><text start="1373.88" dur="4.14">Apes which have sort of run a model</text><text start="1375.5" dur="3.9">right which is like launch something get</text><text start="1378.02" dur="3.06">a whole bunch of Interest launch a bunch</text><text start="1379.4" dur="4.32">of derivative projects I think there&apos;s</text><text start="1381.08" dur="4.26">sort of like a a limitation on that at</text><text start="1383.72" dur="3.6">some point I don&apos;t know where that&apos;s hit</text><text start="1385.34" dur="3.18">maybe we&apos;ve hit that already</text><text start="1387.32" dur="2.58">um you know I think that this sort of</text><text start="1388.52" dur="2.58">membership access thing is is</text><text start="1389.9" dur="3.659">interesting we&apos;re sort of seeing a</text><text start="1391.1" dur="3.84">blending of subscription with ownership</text><text start="1393.559" dur="2.581">um yeah and then I think like this you</text><text start="1394.94" dur="3.78">know again with nouns there&apos;s this</text><text start="1396.14" dur="4.2">Perpetual sort of uh like what are</text><text start="1398.72" dur="3.959">people behind or they&apos;re buying</text><text start="1400.34" dur="4.5">you know a digital representation of a</text><text start="1402.679" dur="4.5">meme that is designed to prepare you</text><text start="1404.84" dur="3.9">know propagate itself into the future</text><text start="1407.179" dur="3.601">um and I think there&apos;s something really</text><text start="1408.74" dur="3.12">interesting about that as well and I</text><text start="1410.78" dur="2.639">think these questions that we&apos;re asking</text><text start="1411.86" dur="3.059">around Community tokens are some of the</text><text start="1413.419" dur="3.661">similar questions that should be asked</text><text start="1414.919" dur="3.24">of the broader web3 or crypto space as</text><text start="1417.08" dur="3.42">well like what what are we actually</text><text start="1418.159" dur="3.721">buying when we own a governance token</text><text start="1420.5" dur="3.6">what is the model that&apos;s actually</text><text start="1421.88" dur="4.799">working there and I think there&apos;s a big</text><text start="1424.1" dur="5.52">TBD on on all of it and so</text><text start="1426.679" dur="4.5">um yeah I think I I really one of my big</text><text start="1429.62" dur="3.299">fears is that we start to see something</text><text start="1431.179" dur="4.021">that really clearly works and all of a</text><text start="1432.919" dur="4.201">sudden we close off ourselves to</text><text start="1435.2" dur="3.66">all sorts of New Opportunities because I</text><text start="1437.12" dur="3.179">think you know the one consistent thing</text><text start="1438.86" dur="4.98">since I&apos;ve been in the space for the</text><text start="1440.299" dur="5.641">last uh five years now is it changes and</text><text start="1443.84" dur="4.56">we we learn off of previous iterations</text><text start="1445.94" dur="3.42">and my guess is that continues for some</text><text start="1448.4" dur="2.22">time</text><text start="1449.36" dur="3.42">right</text><text start="1450.62" dur="3.66">yeah that&apos;s beautiful</text><text start="1452.78" dur="3.3">um</text><text start="1454.28" dur="3.54">are there any other Trends on the edges</text><text start="1456.08" dur="4.579">that you&apos;re interested in in talking</text><text start="1457.82" dur="6.06">about you know take us into the frontier</text><text start="1460.659" dur="6.4">yeah I think I&apos;m just constantly</text><text start="1463.88" dur="5.279">surprised by the variety of Industries</text><text start="1467.059" dur="5.161">or categories that people are are sort</text><text start="1469.159" dur="5.281">of applying the web 3 lens to</text><text start="1472.22" dur="3.54">um you know the the research space is</text><text start="1474.44" dur="3.96">fascinating to me if you think about</text><text start="1475.76" dur="3.98">just the the number of uh the sort of</text><text start="1478.4" dur="4.38">this ability to bring a crowd together</text><text start="1479.74" dur="5.26">to do sort of collective data creation</text><text start="1482.78" dur="4.5">and turn that into some some value that</text><text start="1485.0" dur="3.48">can be you know created and captured by</text><text start="1487.28" dur="2.22">a dow</text><text start="1488.48" dur="3.24">um I think there&apos;s some early or</text><text start="1489.5" dur="4.44">exciting or early experiments and what</text><text start="1491.72" dur="4.439">seems to be called DSi</text><text start="1493.94" dur="4.08">um but uh you know I think there&apos;s still</text><text start="1496.159" dur="3.301">so much to be done there and it starts</text><text start="1498.02" dur="3.96">to get into some of the tricky questions</text><text start="1499.46" dur="4.079">around IP and you know often sort of</text><text start="1501.98" dur="4.62">touches the real world in interesting</text><text start="1503.539" dur="4.441">ways and so that feels very very much on</text><text start="1506.6" dur="2.459">the frontier</text><text start="1507.98" dur="3.6">um and I also think we&apos;ve just sort of</text><text start="1509.059" dur="5.161">come through such a big wave of nfts as</text><text start="1511.58" dur="5.04">pfps and sort of you know speculative</text><text start="1514.22" dur="4.079">Collections and I think like the the</text><text start="1516.62" dur="4.26">hard work now is for people to make</text><text start="1518.299" dur="5.341">these you know digital assets relevant</text><text start="1520.88" dur="4.799">in a world where there isn&apos;t just you</text><text start="1523.64" dur="5.22">know a wash of cash trying to flip pfps</text><text start="1525.679" dur="4.86">you know one of the big things that we</text><text start="1528.86" dur="3.179">you know always caution our teams on is</text><text start="1530.539" dur="3.481">like you know speculation might feel</text><text start="1532.039" dur="4.921">good early on and be able to generate a</text><text start="1534.02" dur="4.8">large treasury but ultimately it usually</text><text start="1536.96" dur="4.02">has an impact on your ability to build</text><text start="1538.82" dur="3.42">meaningful value as a community of</text><text start="1540.98" dur="4.02">people who are there for speculation are</text><text start="1542.24" dur="4.319">often not there for the big adventure</text><text start="1545.0" dur="3.86">that you&apos;re going on as a community and</text><text start="1546.559" dur="4.86">so I think while you know</text><text start="1548.86" dur="4.12">token design structure a story all these</text><text start="1551.419" dur="3.781">sort of things play into how do you</text><text start="1552.98" dur="3.66">actually launch a project that</text><text start="1555.2" dur="3.24">um is focused on getting you know</text><text start="1556.64" dur="3.72">ownership and membership in the hands of</text><text start="1558.44" dur="4.2">the right people who are there for for a</text><text start="1560.36" dur="4.199">big big aligned vision and you know</text><text start="1562.64" dur="3.3">ultimately allow you to sort of move and</text><text start="1564.559" dur="2.761">innovate and do the hard work of</text><text start="1565.94" dur="3.06">actually creating value</text><text start="1567.32" dur="3.42">in these things you know I think there&apos;s</text><text start="1569.0" dur="4.799">there&apos;s a world where you know Community</text><text start="1570.74" dur="5.7">tokens Dows look more like the evolution</text><text start="1573.799" dur="4.98">of a patreon or a Kickstarter</text><text start="1576.44" dur="3.839">um I&apos;m far less interested in that I</text><text start="1578.779" dur="3.241">think what Dows and networks and</text><text start="1580.279" dur="3.421">Community tokens look more like these</text><text start="1582.02" dur="3.48">startups where they&apos;re you know they</text><text start="1583.7" dur="4.02">have an Insight we like to call that the</text><text start="1585.5" dur="4.44">you know a call to Adventure but then</text><text start="1587.72" dur="4.14">the hard work is is and and where values</text><text start="1589.94" dur="3.719">created is through solving big problems</text><text start="1591.86" dur="3.72">and innovating and so these teams need</text><text start="1593.659" dur="4.741">to go out into the world and and sort of</text><text start="1595.58" dur="4.56">uh discover their own insights and You</text><text start="1598.4" dur="4.139">Know Remix existing mechanisms and ideas</text><text start="1600.14" dur="3.48">into to and package them in a way that</text><text start="1602.539" dur="3.781">actually creates values for their</text><text start="1603.62" dur="4.86">organization so that is very much at the</text><text start="1606.32" dur="4.02">edges uh I think we have a lot of you</text><text start="1608.48" dur="3.6">know yeah we&apos;re on the market right now</text><text start="1610.34" dur="4.079">a lot of speculation a lot of hype a lot</text><text start="1612.08" dur="4.92">of you know the the floor prices high</text><text start="1614.419" dur="4.441">but there&apos;s sort of a diminishing</text><text start="1617.0"

thread</text><text start="1887.059" dur="4.081">of the network of networks that you</text><text start="1888.5" dur="5.88">talked about so you know take me forward</text><text start="1891.14" dur="4.62">10 years seed Club I kind of has I don&apos;t</text><text start="1894.38" dur="3.539">want to say tentacles tentacles is not</text><text start="1895.76" dur="5.06">the right word but it&apos;s a network that</text><text start="1897.919" dur="5.041">is reciprocal with hundreds maybe</text><text start="1900.82" dur="3.88">thousands of dowels and it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1902.96" dur="3.959">like this mesh Network that rises and</text><text start="1904.7" dur="3.66">falls with all of the alumni and people</text><text start="1906.919" dur="3.48">that have gone through seed club and</text><text start="1908.36" dur="4.08">then the people that their lives have</text><text start="1910.399" dur="4.5">affected you know tell me tell me about</text><text start="1912.44" dur="3.959">the sort of vision where where seed Club</text><text start="1914.899" dur="4.681">is maximally successful does it look</text><text start="1916.399" dur="5.28">like a network of networks Dow dows</text><text start="1919.58" dur="3.839">yeah I think like the</text><text start="1921.679" dur="4.261">you know we often think about how do we</text><text start="1923.419" dur="4.441">sort of display the value that c Club</text><text start="1925.94" dur="4.08">creates because what we very much don&apos;t</text><text start="1927.86" dur="3.72">want to do is just put a list of Assets</text><text start="1930.02" dur="3.18">in our treasury not only does that not</text><text start="1931.58" dur="3.06">capture like all the the work that</text><text start="1933.2" dur="3.06">hasn&apos;t been done yet it&apos;s just sort of a</text><text start="1934.64" dur="3.3">small snapshot but it&apos;s also like the</text><text start="1936.26" dur="3.659">very much the wrong heuristic in my mind</text><text start="1937.94" dur="3.839">and so this mesh Network like the</text><text start="1939.919" dur="4.26">visualization of this network I think is</text><text start="1941.779" dur="3.841">really what we&apos;ll be leaning into and I</text><text start="1944.179" dur="3.72">think there&apos;s sort of like two main</text><text start="1945.62" dur="5.58">values or things that get me excited</text><text start="1947.899" dur="6.0">about it one is I think one of the core</text><text start="1951.2" dur="4.02">um models that most dowels will roll out</text><text start="1953.899" dur="2.4">as some sort of incubation or</text><text start="1955.22" dur="4.319">accelerating</text><text start="1956.299" dur="5.1">type of product or service or working</text><text start="1959.539" dur="3.661">group right like if you&apos;ve brought</text><text start="1961.399" dur="3.361">together people on a big adventure and</text><text start="1963.2" dur="3.479">you have capital and you have this</text><text start="1964.76" dur="4.38">ability to get things seen a very</text><text start="1966.679" dur="4.5">natural thing is to to use that that</text><text start="1969.14" dur="4.32">value to help support others other</text><text start="1971.179" dur="4.561">projects that are in you know working</text><text start="1973.46" dur="4.38">towards a similar adventure and so we</text><text start="1975.74" dur="3.84">see this early on even with like our</text><text start="1977.84" dur="3.719">projects like cres house which are on a</text><text start="1979.58" dur="3.479">mission to to buy and operate an NBA</text><text start="1981.559" dur="4.021">sports franchise and are taking a bunch</text><text start="1983.059" dur="3.961">of small steps towards that and you&apos;re</text><text start="1985.58" dur="3.42">seeing all sorts of new tools and</text><text start="1987.02" dur="3.24">sub-projects and things sort of spin out</text><text start="1989.0" dur="3.24">of that and so we&apos;ll sort of see well</text><text start="1990.26" dur="3.72">cross house would be a node from our our</text><text start="1992.24" dur="3.0">second or third cohort what then you&apos;ll</text><text start="1993.98" dur="4.16">see is probably a whole bunch of nodes</text><text start="1995.24" dur="5.58">off of that and and you know the the</text><text start="1998.14" dur="4.84">impact will grow far beyond anything</text><text start="2000.82" dur="3.959">that we would have on on a daily or a</text><text start="2002.98" dur="2.939">weekly or even maybe any basis like</text><text start="2004.779" dur="2.4">there are so many things happening</text><text start="2005.919" dur="3.841">through our communities right now that I</text><text start="2007.179" dur="3.781">have absolutely no clue about uh but</text><text start="2009.76" dur="4.2">they&apos;re sort of through line right back</text><text start="2010.96" dur="5.04">to to C Club the other part is like we</text><text start="2013.96" dur="4.62">have a number of participants that come</text><text start="2016.0" dur="4.559">through and have you know applied with</text><text start="2018.58" dur="4.14">it with a team and a big big idea and</text><text start="2020.559" dur="4.081">then they ultimately decide that</text><text start="2022.72" dur="4.26">there they thought was there wasn&apos;t</text><text start="2024.64" dur="4.379">there and so we&apos;re very excited about</text><text start="2026.98" dur="3.66">teams who realize that and say hey this</text><text start="2029.019" dur="2.821">isn&apos;t going to work the way we thought</text><text start="2030.64" dur="3.539">it was going to work and so we&apos;re going</text><text start="2031.84" dur="3.719">to Sunset the project because for us</text><text start="2034.179" dur="3.181">it&apos;s the most important things that we</text><text start="2035.559" dur="3.541">put out projects that we can truly</text><text start="2037.36" dur="3.299">deeply stand behind and support our</text><text start="2039.1" dur="3.6">brand is associated with all of these</text><text start="2040.659" dur="3.481">things and so the worst idea would be</text><text start="2042.7" dur="3.06">for a team to move forward and launch a</text><text start="2044.14" dur="3.18">token just because even you know even</text><text start="2045.76" dur="3.54">though they don&apos;t have anything anymore</text><text start="2047.32" dur="3.42">but what happens out of that is that</text><text start="2049.3" dur="3.48">those people become some of the biggest</text><text start="2050.74" dur="4.32">supporters of our other projects so I</text><text start="2052.78" dur="5.339">think about Austin Roby who who applied</text><text start="2055.06" dur="3.96">for our second batch with ampled he came</text><text start="2058.119" dur="3.0">in</text><text start="2059.02" dur="3.72">um went so deep on on the sort of</text><text start="2061.119" dur="4.081">community token model for ample which is</text><text start="2062.74" dur="4.74">like a a music uh</text><text start="2065.2" dur="4.74">like patreon but it&apos;s set up as a co-op</text><text start="2067.48" dur="3.54">which is super interesting and they</text><text start="2069.94" dur="3.54">ultimately decided not to go forward</text><text start="2071.02" dur="4.379">with the token but Austin and Yancey</text><text start="2073.48" dur="4.679">strickler was one of the co-founders of</text><text start="2075.399" dur="4.681">and CEO of Kickstarter applied for our</text><text start="2078.159" dur="3.901">fourth cohort and they&apos;re now building a</text><text start="2080.08" dur="4.019">project called meta label alongside Rob</text><text start="2082.06" dur="3.96">who is the founder of etsy brilliant</text><text start="2084.099" dur="3.54">people are coming back and so and then</text><text start="2086.02" dur="3.06">of course people start other projects or</text><text start="2087.639" dur="3.0">they join other projects and so this</text><text start="2089.08" dur="2.819">sort of network of networks if we think</text><text start="2090.639" dur="4.621">about great people and great projects</text><text start="2091.899" dur="5.341">are this is constantly evolving and so</text><text start="2095.26" dur="3.9">um to me that&apos;s the core right we just</text><text start="2097.24" dur="3.42">want to be very thoughtful about the</text><text start="2099.16" dur="3.54">people and the projects we bring</text><text start="2100.66" dur="3.9">together sea Club isn&apos;t trying to be the</text><text start="2102.7" dur="3.72">a million person Network that anybody</text><text start="2104.56" dur="3.6">can just join you know there is a</text><text start="2106.42" dur="3.0">curation at every layer that we play</text><text start="2108.16" dur="3.0">with and</text><text start="2109.42" dur="3.48">um you know that&apos;s not always the right</text><text start="2111.16" dur="3.6">model and I think this broad permissive</text><text start="2112.9" dur="4.5">access is very exciting for many</text><text start="2114.76" dur="4.68">projects we are going the opposite</text><text start="2117.4" dur="4.32">direction and it&apos;s one where</text><text start="2119.44" dur="3.96">um you know the value that to get to</text><text start="2121.72" dur="4.44">create for early stage projects is is</text><text start="2123.4" dur="5.04">best done through curating smartest best</text><text

start="2139.48" dur="3.48">future it seems like you&apos;ve just kind of</text><text start="2141.339" dur="3.121">created this Alumni network that&apos;s got</text><text start="2142.96" dur="3.0">the all these positive some games and</text><text start="2144.46" dur="3.24">hopefully he&apos;s having a positive impact</text><text start="2145.96" dur="3.3">on the on the world but they all sort of</text><text start="2147.7" dur="4.139">have</text><text start="2149.26" dur="4.92">uh a network that can support each other</text><text start="2151.839" dur="4.801">and in seed Club kind of has governance</text><text start="2154.18" dur="5.159">or upside uh I think three percent of of</text><text start="2156.64" dur="4.62">each of the projects is is what you said</text><text start="2159.339" dur="4.321">yeah so so yeah three percent is</text><text start="2161.26" dur="3.839">contributed to the Dow and so yeah we</text><text start="2163.66" dur="3.24">you know C Club will be an active</text><text start="2165.099" dur="4.201">participant in governance and and</text><text start="2166.9" dur="3.6">support beyond the accelerator and you</text><text start="2169.3" dur="4.02">know I think we&apos;ll continue to explore</text><text start="2170.5" dur="4.98">how we can be supportive as teams and</text><text start="2173.32" dur="3.299">projects and and doubts become bigger</text><text start="2175.48" dur="3.3">and bigger</text><text start="2176.619" dur="3.96">um and and then those folks the people</text><text start="2178.78" dur="3.72">who are who are leading those projects</text><text start="2180.579" dur="4.26">and the projects themselves get a grant</text><text start="2182.5" dur="3.9">of Club tokens as well so they will be a</text><text start="2184.839" dur="3.841">part of choosing our next cohort you</text><text start="2186.4" dur="4.679">know managing um where and how we put</text><text start="2188.68" dur="4.5">our time and and Steward our funds long</text><text start="2191.079" dur="3.241">term and there&apos;s just so many unknown</text><text start="2193.18" dur="2.939">questions</text><text start="2194.32" dur="3.36">um for the operations and structuring of</text><text start="2196.119" dur="3.48">C club that we still have to go figure</text><text start="2197.68" dur="3.6">out and you can think of no better group</text><text start="2199.599" dur="3.361">of people to help inform that than the</text><text start="2201.28" dur="3.0">folks who are you know running their own</text><text start="2202.96" dur="2.28">experiments in their own edges of the</text><text start="2204.28" dur="2.76">internet</text><text start="2205.24" dur="4.02">yeah totally</text><text start="2207.04" dur="4.02">um and then you know I&apos;m sure they refer</text><text start="2209.26" dur="4.38">potential next projects from the cohort</text><text start="2211.06" dur="4.62">to the network and word of mouth is the</text><text start="2213.64" dur="5.04">best I&apos;ve always just found in hiring</text><text start="2215.68" dur="4.8">and with like with with discovering new</text><text start="2218.68" dur="4.56">products word of mouth is the best way</text><text start="2220.48" dur="4.56">to discover High signal to noise because</text><text start="2223.24" dur="4.5">it&apos;s your friends and if you trust them</text><text start="2225.04" dur="4.68">then there&apos;s it it just it just filters</text><text start="2227.74" dur="4.859">out all the noise well I mean I think</text><text start="2229.72" dur="5.28">like trust and attention are the two</text><text start="2232.599" dur="3.48">scarcest resources on the internet and</text><text start="2235.0" dur="3.24">you know</text><text start="2236.079" dur="4.561">we&apos;re really maximizing for building</text><text start="2238.24" dur="3.96">trust and and you know creating value</text><text start="2240.64" dur="4.08">for the attention that our projects</text><text start="2242.2" dur="3.6">provide and then also can be a a great</text><text start="2244.72" dur="3.119">signal</text><text start="2245.8" dur="4.44">um for uh for the broader public to see</text><text start="2247.839" dur="4.201">like what you know my my big dream is</text><text start="2250.24" dur="3.599">that we Steward the C club brand to such</text><text start="2252.04" dur="3.72">a point that as you see a project that&apos;s</text><text start="2253.839" dur="5.041">come through C Club it&apos;s a it&apos;s an easy</text><text start="2255.76" dur="4.44">thing to say yes to pay pay attention to</text><text start="2258.88" dur="3.239">um and I think that&apos;s why we work with</text><text start="2260.2" dur="4.26">very small batches and we&apos;re you know we</text><text start="2262.119" dur="4.74">didn&apos;t scale our cohort size even though</text><text start="2264.46" dur="4.26">we saw almost a 10x and increase the</text><text start="2266.859" dur="3.841">number of applications for a last cohort</text><text start="2268.72" dur="4.56">we&apos;re not scaling the size this time in</text><text start="2270.7" dur="4.62">fact if we don&apos;t you know we couldn&apos;t</text><text start="2273.28" dur="3.78">theoretically go smaller if we felt like</text><text start="2275.32" dur="3.24">that was still going would be necessary</text><text start="2277.06" dur="3.0">to create like the the right sort of</text><text start="2278.56" dur="2.64">potent of human beings that are coming</text><text start="2280.06" dur="2.82">together</text><text start="2281.2" dur="2.94">um so yeah I think like making sure that</text><text start="2282.88" dur="3.3">we</text><text start="2284.14" dur="3.66">you know if we do that well we create so</text><text start="2286.18" dur="4.439">much value for our members as well where</text><text start="2287.8" dur="4.14">we can actually put these ideas and</text><text start="2290.619" dur="3.061">maybe some of them look very weird or</text><text start="2291.94" dur="3.659">wild to start with but if we have</text><text start="2293.68" dur="3.36">conviction on them we can play a very</text><text start="2295.599" dur="4.441">you know meaningful role in helping them</text><text start="2297.04" dur="4.5">get from zero to one which is you know I</text><text start="2300.04" dur="2.579">think especially for folks who are</text><text start="2301.54" dur="2.52">coming into the space from the outside</text><text start="2302.619" dur="4.381">and haven&apos;t built their own sense making</text><text start="2304.06" dur="4.74">Network it can be a a big challenge to</text><text start="2307.0" dur="4.26">build that trust and Authority that gets</text><text start="2308.8" dur="4.26">on the radar of people who who have you</text><text start="2311.26" dur="3.359">know the ability to really you know</text><text start="2313.06" dur="3.48">amplify or make a difference for some of</text><text start="2314.619" dur="3.421">these projects so I think that&apos;s the</text><text start="2316.54" dur="3.48">some of the most exciting things we</text><text start="2318.04" dur="3.72">think about meta-label you know meta</text><text start="2320.02" dur="3.599">label came in with this big exciting</text><text start="2321.76" dur="4.44">vision and also some big huge questions</text><text start="2323.619" dur="4.381">about web3 I think they were very very</text><text start="2326.2" dur="3.6">Discerning about how they were stepping</text><text start="2328.0" dur="3.78">into the space and</text><text start="2329.8" dur="4.5">um it&apos;s probably one of my my favorite</text><text start="2331.78" dur="4.14">stories is just to see you know see the</text><text start="2334.3" dur="3.24">change in the excitement that that team</text><text start="2335.92" dur="2.88">has had in the space and there&apos;s just no</text><text start="2337.54" dur="2.94">doubt in my mind about the value and</text><text start="2338.8" dur="2.94">impact they&apos;re going to create</text><text start="2340.48" dur="3.24">yeah</text><text start="2341.74" dur="3.78">yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s really a beautiful thing</text><text start="2343.72" dur="3.24">I mean to see your friend succeed this</text><text start="2345.52" dur="2.819">is you know this is like the thesis of a</text><text start="2346.96" dur="3.899">lot of the stuff that I&apos;ve been having</text><text start="2348.339" dur="6.901">on the Pod over the last little while is</text><text start="2350.859" dur="6.541">Squad Squad wealth uh meta-label growing</text><text start="2355.24" dur="3.599">a network together that that&apos;s positive</text><text start="2357.4" dur="4.02">some game and it feels like we&apos;re moving</text><text start="2358.839" dur="3.841">from this like this you know Yancy</text><text start="2361.42" dur="3.06">always talks about bentoism which is</text><text start="2362.68" dur="3.899">going from now me to Future us so</text><text start="2364.48" dur="4.68">expanding out on the time Dimension and</text><text start="2366.579" dur="4.381">on the multiplayer Dimension and it&apos;s it</text><text start="2369.16" dur="4.679">really is just all about succeeding</text><text start="2370.96" dur="4.68">together on on long-term uh time Horizon</text><text start="2373.839" dur="3.721">that it feels like that&apos;s the consistent</text><text start="2375.64" dur="5.16">theme that I&apos;m drawing in a lot of uh</text><text start="2377.56" dur="5.519">green pill guests and uh yeah I I I&apos;m</text><text start="2380.8" dur="3.6">curious if you how you how about jobs</text><text start="2383.079" dur="4.881">with you</text><text start="2384.4" dur="3.56">yeah I mean I think like the</text><text start="2388.119" dur="4.021">it drives well I think you know there&apos;s</text><text start="2389.68" dur="4.02">this sort of part of human nature that</text><text start="2392.14" dur="3.66">and I definitely sort of feel as well</text><text start="2393.7" dur="4.2">where you know it can can feel like you</text><text start="2395.8" dur="4.62">want to be competitive and and that</text><text start="2397.9" dur="4.92">there&apos;s sort of this um you know we so</text><text start="2400.42" dur="3.6">much of our lit or at least my lived</text><text start="2402.82" dur="3.12">experience is one that started defined</text><text start="2404.02" dur="3.92">by scarcity in different ways and I</text><text start="2405.94" dur="4.86">think what is so interesting is how</text><text start="2407.94" dur="5.32">often the lessons come to show that by</text><text start="2410.8" dur="4.86">being open by being supportive by really</text><text start="2413.26" dur="7.14">trying to lean into I love them the now</text><text start="2415.66" dur="6.959">me and future we uh ideas is not only</text><text start="2420.4" dur="3.84">a far better more fun way to live your</text><text start="2422.619" dur="3.601">life but also leads to more</text><text start="2424.24" dur="3.18">opportunities and however you and</text><text start="2426.22" dur="2.46">success however you want to Define that</text><text start="2427.42" dur="3.72">whether that is more connections</text><text start="2428.68" dur="5.22">relationships you know wealth</text><text start="2431.14" dur="4.32">opportunities Etc like this building</text><text start="2433.9" dur="4.439">these networks of people that you just</text><text start="2435.46" dur="4.08">Vibe with and and you know you want to</text><text start="2438.339" dur="3.721">see succeed and they want to see you</text><text start="2439.54" dur="4.5">succeed is just like such an incredible</text><text start="2442.06" dur="5.46">asset and and</text><text start="2444.04" dur="4.74">next superpower I think and so 100 on</text><text start="2447.52" dur="2.76">board with that</text><text start="2448.78" dur="3.42">yeah</text><text start="2450.28" dur="3.72">yeah well uh I think that you know we&apos;ve</text><text start="2452.2" dur="3.72">been rolling for 35 minutes uh we got</text><text start="2454.0" dur="3.18">maybe 10 or 15 left I&apos;d love to just</text><text start="2455.92" dur="3.5">open up the aperture of this</text><text start="2457.18" dur="4.74">conversation towards</text><text start="2459.42" dur="4.06">uh really whatever you&apos;re interested in</text><text start="2461.92" dur="3.24">I think that you&apos;re on the frontier and</text><text start="2463.48" dur="3.18">you could probably guide it so is there</text><text start="2465.16" dur="2.88">anything I didn&apos;t ask that you want to</text><text start="2466.66" dur="3.3">jam on</text><text start="2468.04" dur="3.539">yeah I think one of like the</text><text start="2469.96" dur="3.84">you know it&apos;s been so interesting to see</text><text start="2471.579" dur="5.221">this Dao meme really take over for the</text><text start="2473.8" dur="4.98">last little while like it&apos;s it&apos;s uh</text><text start="2476.8" dur="2.88">got a lot of momentum behind and it&apos;s</text><text start="2478.78" dur="2.52">sort of entering into the point of</text><text start="2479.68" dur="3.54">conversation right now where it&apos;s I</text><text start="2481.3" dur="3.96">think getting more mainstream-ish early</text><text start="2483.22" dur="3.78">mainstream attention and with it comes</text><text start="2485.26" dur="3.66">all these sort of like very obvious</text><text start="2487.0" dur="4.5">criticisms that I think many of us that</text><text start="2488.92" dur="4.5">are in the space already are very you</text><text start="2491.5" dur="3.66">know clearly understand but I think</text><text start="2493.42" dur="3.48">they&apos;re sort of um</text><text start="2495.16" dur="3.84">you know even within the Builders of the</text><text start="2496.9" dur="3.36">space sort of uh misunderstood and I</text><text start="2499.0" dur="2.82">think a big one of those is around sort</text><text start="2500.26" dur="3.12">of like the the organizational and</text><text start="2501.82" dur="3.18">operational structure that exists in</text><text start="2503.38" dur="3.9">these communities</text><text start="2505.0" dur="4.2">um and I&apos;m curious actually in your</text><text start="2507.28" dur="3.78">thoughts here as well and I think this</text><text start="2509.2" dur="3.419">sort of early sort of thin version of</text><text start="2511.06" dur="4.14">the meme that people get is like okay</text><text start="2512.619" dur="4.861">there&apos;s this huge you know wide flat</text><text start="2515.2" dur="4.5">hierarchy-less organization that has</text><text start="2517.48" dur="3.18">maybe a token and has some incentives</text><text start="2519.7" dur="3.12">and they&apos;re going to go out and solve</text><text start="2520.66" dur="3.959">big problems and it&apos;s very easy to pull</text><text start="2522.82" dur="4.14">that apart because you know well it&apos;s</text><text start="2524.619" dur="3.841">you know very tough to make great</text><text start="2526.96" dur="3.3">products if you&apos;re trying to design on</text><text start="2528.46" dur="3.78">based on consensus you know how do you</text><text start="2530.26" dur="3.9">ensure that the tragedy the commons or a</text><text start="2532.24" dur="3.78">free Road load of problems don&apos;t sort of</text><text start="2534.16" dur="3.0">completely destroy your operations and</text><text start="2536.02" dur="4.079">your your Effectiveness as an</text><text start="2537.16" dur="4.32">organization and you know on and on and</text><text start="2540.099" dur="2.941">on and on I think there&apos;s a you know</text><text start="2541.48" dur="3.42">haven&apos;t we already solved all these</text><text start="2543.04" dur="3.72">problems with with the company structure</text><text start="2544.9" dur="3.0">and so I think like the the most</text><text start="2546.76" dur="2.94">interesting conversations I&apos;m having</text><text start="2547.9" dur="4.08">with our alumni projects right now is</text><text start="2549.7" dur="4.2">sort of going from I don&apos;t think that</text><text start="2551.98" dur="4.139">belief that there&apos;s you know we we&apos;re</text><text start="2553.9" dur="4.56">very clear and at least our world view</text><text start="2556.119" dur="3.72">that you know did just a pure flat</text><text start="2558.46" dur="3.06">structure can be</text><text start="2559.839" dur="4.921">um can be challenging to navigate early</text><text start="2561.52" dur="4.86">on in in Dows and that some structure is</text><text start="2564.76" dur="3.48">important but I think most teams sort of</text><text start="2566.38" dur="4.08">underestimate the importance of of</text><text start="2568.24" dur="4.14">structure in in rolling out operations</text><text start="2570.46" dur="3.84">and actually doing the important thing</text><text start="2572.38" dur="2.94">which is you know building momentum and</text><text start="2574.3" dur="4.08">ensuring that these organizations</text><text start="2575.32" dur="4.499">sustain over the long term so I think</text><text start="2578.38" dur="3.42">what&apos;s interesting there for me is is</text><text start="2579.819" dur="3.721">both like the fact that I have always</text><text start="2581.8" dur="3.539">sort of operated with this idea of of</text><text start="2583.54" dur="3.66">you know c-club having operational</text><text start="2585.339" dur="4.02">structure and not just being this broad</text><text start="2587.2" dur="3.96">permissive network but there are so many</text><text start="2589.359" dur="3.061">levels of that and understanding and</text><text start="2591.16" dur="3.0">what we&apos;ve seen over the last little</text><text start="2592.42" dur="4.56">while in our organization is that the</text><text start="2594.16" dur="5.04">more clear and structure that we can</text><text start="2596.98" dur="3.96">apply not to the end of like here you</text><text start="2599.2" dur="2.82">know here&apos;s the CEO and your boss and</text><text start="2600.94" dur="2.159">and</text><text start="2602.02" dur="3.059">um they&apos;re going to tell you what to do</text><text start="2603.099" dur="4.26">but more and like how do I as an</text><text start="2605.079" dur="4.381">individual come in and create value</text><text start="2607.359" dur="3.48">towards what what are the Norms how do</text><text start="2609.46" dur="3.06">we actually build the structures that</text><text start="2610.839" dur="3.061">allow for self-management to to be</text><text start="2612.52" dur="2.7">effective</text><text start="2613.9" dur="3.24">um you know for us it&apos;s really been</text><text start="2615.22" dur="3.599">about bringing in Far More structure and</text><text start="2617.14" dur="3.6">encouraging far more leadership than</text><text start="2618.819" dur="4.441">what I think most people who maybe are</text><text start="2620.74" dur="4.079">on the outside of the Dow space would</text><text start="2623.26" dur="2.7">recognize</text><text start="2624.819" dur="2.221">yeah</text><text start="2625.96" dur="3.0">yeah I think there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2627.04" dur="3.539">experimentation going on right now I</text><text start="2628.96" dur="3.24">mean you know one one thing where maybe</text><text start="2630.579" dur="2.941">you and I differ you know I&apos;m actually</text><text start="2632.2" dur="2.94">curious to pick your brain on this is</text><text start="2633.52" dur="3.18">like I don&apos;t think a lot of these dials</text><text start="2635.14" dur="3.84">are going to be successful if we have if</text><text start="2636.7" dur="4.26">they have if we go all the way from</text><text start="2638.98" dur="3.599">hierarchies to just totally flat</text><text start="2640.96" dur="4.139">organizations it feels like</text><text start="2642.579" dur="5.221">proportionality is is something in the</text><text start="2645.099" dur="4.081">center there and and and I&apos;m wondering</text><text start="2647.8" dur="3.12">how you think about proportionality</text><text start="2649.18" dur="5.34">because you know there&apos;s really a lot of</text><text start="2650.92" dur="4.919">nuance in that people uh if they&apos;re in a</text><text start="2654.52" dur="3.0">role in which they&apos;re really crushing it</text><text start="2655.839" dur="2.641">and delivering a lot of value I think</text><text start="2657.52" dur="3.9">that you need to have that</text><text start="2658.48" dur="4.92">proportionality of of outcome and and</text><text start="2661.42" dur="3.419">governance control that that routes</text><text start="2663.4" dur="3.9">towards the a players that are in the</text><text start="2664.839" dur="4.02">right roles and and like B players who</text><text start="2667.3" dur="3.18">are in the wrong roles should be moved</text><text start="2668.859" dur="3.541">out of it and you can&apos;t have that in a</text><text start="2670.48" dur="4.74">totally flat organization you need to</text><text start="2672.4" dur="4.26">have a proportionality in in that so I</text><text start="2675.22" dur="3.0">don&apos;t know the organizational Dynamics</text><text start="2676.66" dur="2.76">As you move away from hierarchy get way</text><text start="2678.22" dur="3.0">more complicated because you have to</text><text start="2679.42" dur="2.939">build this peer-to-peer mesh network of</text><text start="2681.22" dur="3.3">feedback where people are honestly</text><text start="2682.359" dur="3.541">sharing feedback and receiving feedback</text><text start="2684.52" dur="4.38">from each other and evolving forward</text><text start="2685.9" dur="5.459">word and and I think proportionality is</text><text start="2688.9" dur="3.6">is a big thing there so you you know I</text><text start="2691.359" dur="2.701">don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any Trends you&apos;ve</text><text start="2692.5" dur="3.24">seen but that&apos;s what I&apos;ve seen in the</text><text start="2694.06" dur="5.1">get coin Network</text><text start="2695.74" dur="5.82">yeah I 100 agree and I think you know</text><text start="2699.16" dur="4.08">the the biggest point of impact or maybe</text><text start="2701.56" dur="3.48">there&apos;s two one is sort of the the</text><text start="2703.24" dur="4.14">culture that gets built and set I think</text><text start="2705.04" dur="3.6">being very purposeful around that</text><text start="2707.38" dur="3.239">culture building which is sort of like</text><text start="2708.64" dur="3.54">the the evolution of the the sum total</text><text start="2710.619" dur="3.601">decisions that are being made and how</text><text start="2712.18" dur="3.96">those are being made and</text><text start="2714.22" dur="3.899">um I think like that&apos;s a much easier</text><text start="2716.14" dur="3.36">thing to do when you&apos;re a small group of</text><text start="2718.119" dur="3.121">people and you can have those sort of</text><text start="2719.5" dur="4.14">open lines of communication and fast</text><text start="2721.24" dur="3.839">feedback but it gets exponentially more</text><text start="2723.64" dur="2.82">difficult as you start to expand that</text><text start="2725.079" dur="4.381">Network and so you sort of have a window</text><text start="2726.46" dur="4.8">of time to really set that culture where</text><text start="2729.46" dur="3.359">you know as you grow and grow it becomes</text><text start="2731.26" dur="3.059">much more difficult to make those</text><text start="2732.819" dur="3.061">changes in in some cases I think it</text><text start="2734.319" dur="2.941">might be you know the risk is</text><text start="2735.88" dur="2.82">existential where</text><text start="2737.26" dur="3.839">there isn&apos;t a coming back from that</text><text start="2738.7" dur="4.08">unless there&apos;s a hard reset</text><text start="2741.099" dur="4.441">um which I think is is challenging and</text><text start="2742.78" dur="4.14">the second big piece is like who who and</text><text start="2745.54" dur="3.72">how are you bringing are you sort of</text><text start="2746.92" dur="4.14">bringing people in or are people joining</text><text start="2749.26" dur="3.599">um and I think like four networks are</text><text start="2751.06" dur="5.46">aiming to be more flat and have no</text><text start="2752.859" dur="6.0">hierarchy like the the you sort of need</text><text start="2756.52" dur="4.2">to move that that the structure needs to</text><text start="2758.859" dur="5.041">support that so if I think about you</text><text start="2760.72" dur="5.52">know C club we are you know very we have</text><text start="2763.9" dur="4.62">a very small stewards team</text><text start="2766.24" dur="4.26">um and ensuring that those people are</text><text start="2768.52" dur="3.839">incredible Builders but hold the values</text><text start="2770.5" dur="3.72">and culture of C Club very clearly their</text><text start="2772.359" dur="4.26">minds are essential for us as they build</text><text start="2774.22" dur="4.68">out and and you know recruit for their</text><text start="2776.619" dur="4.261">contributor members Etc and ensuring</text><text start="2778.9" dur="4.14">that those sort of um I guess the the</text><text start="2780.88" dur="4.439">early people that are are taking and</text><text start="2783.04" dur="4.44">assuming responsibility or or the right</text><text start="2785.319" dur="3.661">people and and making tough changes if</text><text start="2787.48" dur="2.94">that&apos;s not the case</text><text start="2788.98" dur="2.94">um I think when you look at something</text><text start="2790.42" dur="2.64">like nouns which I wouldn&apos;t say is a</text><text start="2791.92" dur="3.899">very different type of organization</text><text start="2793.06" dur="4.74">where they&apos;re you know yes they&apos;re sort</text><text start="2795.819" dur="4.441">of financial barrier to access ownership</text><text start="2797.8" dur="3.779">in that network but anybody can do it</text><text start="2800.26" dur="3.599">and if you have money you can kind of</text><text start="2801.579" dur="3.54">can can join what they&apos;ve done is sort</text><text start="2803.859" dur="2.941">of pushed a lot of like the hard</text><text start="2805.119" dur="3.48">organizational structuring work out to</text><text start="2806.8" dur="3.72">the edges and so they said hey all we&apos;re</text><text start="2808.599" dur="4.081">going to do is allocate Capital so we</text><text start="2810.52" dur="3.839">vote on proposals and then teams or</text><text start="2812.68" dur="3.84">individuals who have their own work</text><text start="2814.359" dur="4.021">structures and leaders Etc are now</text><text start="2816.52" dur="3.72">tasked with response the responsibility</text><text start="2818.38" dur="3.719">of executing on that so I think there&apos;s</text><text start="2820.24" dur="3.66">like you know depending on how you are</text><text start="2822.099" dur="3.421">building your network or Dow you need to</text><text start="2823.9" dur="4.32">think through like what are the right</text><text start="2825.52" dur="5.04">decisions to be made by you know by by</text><text start="2828.22" dur="3.66">these token holders and and then how do</text><text start="2830.56" dur="3.96">you ultimately create structures where</text><text start="2831.88" dur="5.219">small groups of people can you know can</text><text start="2834.52" dur="4.98">create value can be measured on that</text><text start="2837.099" dur="4.561">value can grow their reputation and</text><text start="2839.5" dur="4.02">ability to further Access Capital based</text><text start="2841.66" dur="3.0">on that value and there&apos;s still a ton of</text><text start="2843.52" dur="2.7">work to be done in the announced</text><text start="2844.66" dur="2.939">ecosystem on this but I think that&apos;s</text><text start="2846.22" dur="3.42">maybe one of the most interesting</text><text start="2847.599" dur="5.281">insights I think Brian Flynn tweeted</text><text start="2849.64" dur="5.28">nouns moves the ability to rug away from</text><text start="2852.88" dur="4.62">the founders and to the contributors</text><text start="2854.92" dur="7.38">it&apos;s like an interesting</text><text start="2857.5" dur="7.2">yeah well just even using that word like</text><text start="2862.3" dur="4.26">just even using that word creates such a</text><text start="2864.7" dur="3.24">diversarial dynamic to be but I I could</text><text start="2866.56" dur="3.38">appreciate that we&apos;re at least taking</text><text start="2867.94" dur="3.96">that and pushing it out to the edges</text><text start="2869.94" dur="4.06">well and I think what&apos;s interesting is</text><text start="2871.9" dur="3.719">like when you look at how that that</text><text start="2874.0" dur="3.3">Community is deploying capitals it&apos;s</text><text start="2875.619" dur="3.901">very much being done</text><text start="2877.3" dur="3.72">um I mean at least from the outside I&apos;m</text><text start="2879.52" dur="3.9">not an ounce holder</text><text start="2881.02" dur="4.44">um with the idea of like velocity of of</text><text start="2883.42" dur="3.6">funding and of projects and experiments</text><text start="2885.46" dur="3.899">being one of the core metrics that they</text><text start="2887.02" dur="4.559">they track right so it&apos;s it&apos;s not as if</text><text start="2889.359" dur="3.301">there&apos;s this like huge important I don&apos;t</text><text start="2891.579" dur="3.601">even think they have a clear feedback</text><text start="2892.66" dur="3.84">loop on on sort of measuring that</text><text start="2895.18" dur="3.48">success right now which is probably a</text><text start="2896.5" dur="3.78">bit of a mess or a piece that needs to</text><text start="2898.66" dur="3.3">be built out but instead they&apos;re saying</text><text start="2900.28" dur="3.48">hey there is so much energy and</text><text start="2901.96" dur="3.119">excitement for this let&apos;s make sure</text><text start="2903.76" dur="2.88">we&apos;re putting hands into it or money</text><text start="2905.079" dur="3.361">into the hands of what we collectively</text><text start="2906.64" dur="3.959">believe to be you know useful projects</text><text start="2908.44" dur="3.659">in this space knowing that many of them</text><text start="2910.599" dur="3.961">will probably not have the impact that</text><text start="2912.099" dur="4.861">they want to have but that enough will</text><text start="2914.56" dur="4.44">mm-hmm yeah</text><text start="2916.96" dur="3.54">yeah that&apos;s</text><text start="2919.0" dur="3.42">yeah one would hope with the law of</text><text start="2920.5" dur="3.0">large numbers that enough will</text><text start="2922.42" dur="2.939">um</text><text start="2923.5" dur="3.66">I think it&apos;s an exciting open experiment</text><text start="2925.359" dur="4.441">right and this is the thing that gets me</text><text start="2927.16" dur="3.6">so stoked into space is is you know if</text><text start="2929.8" dur="3.059">you&apos;re if you&apos;re running a project in</text><text start="2930.76" dur="3.96">the space there&apos;s every week or month</text><text start="2932.859" dur="3.541">new mechanisms come out that you have to</text><text start="2934.72" dur="4.26">really look at and see like does this</text><text start="2936.4" dur="3.48">materially change how how what we&apos;re</text><text start="2938.98" dur="1.5">doing</text><text start="2939.88" dur="4.08">um</text><text start="2940.48" dur="5.16">you know will get done uh sort of a new</text><text start="2943.96" dur="3.18">type of of category that&apos;s being</text><text start="2945.64" dur="3.36">designed here that we need to go play in</text><text start="2947.14" dur="4.14">or that we should you know adapt from in</text><text start="2949.0" dur="5.099">some way and so this idea of you know I</text><text start="2951.28" dur="4.38">think of Dao&apos;s as one of the like the</text><text start="2954.099" dur="2.881">Dow that we&apos;re building C Cloud as one</text><text start="2955.66" dur="3.36">of our products so we need to think</text><text start="2956.98" dur="4.2">through and evolve the mechanisms that</text><text start="2959.02" dur="5.579">ultimately support the the development</text><text start="2961.18" dur="5.28">of the C club network and uh you know I</text><text start="2964.599" dur="3.301">don&apos;t think that the knowledge and</text><text start="2966.46" dur="3.42">structures that we have today are going</text><text start="2967.9" dur="4.26">to be the ones that persist fully into</text><text start="2969.88" dur="4.32">the future and and the ability to sort</text><text start="2972.16" dur="3.84">of innovate and stay up to and</text><text start="2974.2" dur="3.659">incorporate the best parts of the</text><text start="2976.0" dur="3.359">projects in in the right way I think is</text><text start="2977.859" dur="3.601">probably the biggest challenge and</text><text start="2979.359" dur="3.781">opportunity for folks that are sort of</text><text start="2981.46" dur="3.659">tasked with that part of Dow building</text><text start="2983.14" dur="3.479">yeah</text><text start="2985.119" dur="4.141">yeah</text><text start="2986.619" dur="3.901">oh man uh it&apos;s been so great to chat</text><text start="2989.26" dur="2.88">with you about C Club I just think that</text><text start="2990.52" dur="3.54">what you&apos;re doing is so cool and it&apos;s so</text><text start="2992.14" dur="4.8">pro-social and</text><text start="2994.06" dur="4.86">um it&apos;s like like I&apos;ll start from the</text><text start="2996.94" dur="4.02">thesis that I wanted to have you on the</text><text start="2998.92" dur="4.439">Pod was Generator function of impact</text><text start="3000.96" dur="5.399">dolls and you know if these projects are</text><text start="3003.359" dur="4.98">creating object level impact then then</text><text start="3006.359" dur="4.141">you&apos;re sort of like generating that and</text><text start="3008.339" dur="4.081">at scale and in over time I I can&apos;t wait</text><text start="3010.5" dur="4.38">to have you back let&apos;s say in like 2024</text><text start="3012.42" dur="4.86">and talk about all the alumni and and</text><text start="3014.88" dur="4.739">how it&apos;s gone so uh thanks for coming on</text><text start="3017.28" dur="5.039">the Pod man it gets me so excited to</text><text start="3019.619" dur="3.361">think about what 2024 and 2025 looks</text><text start="3022.319" dur="3.901">like</text><text start="3022.98" dur="5.28">um and yeah huge fans of Bitcoin and of</text><text start="3026.22" dur="4.5">yourself as well in this podcast so it&apos;s</text><text start="3028.26" dur="4.2">really great to be on here and uh I see</text><text start="3030.72" dur="3.78">collaboration in our future and we&apos;ll</text><text start="3032.46" dur="3.18">you know continue to look for great ways</text><text start="3034.5" dur="2.94">where we can come together</text><text start="3035.64" dur="4.02">cool well I see coordination in our</text><text start="3037.44" dur="5.82">future little slight slight change in</text><text start="3039.66" dur="4.62">framing there but uh yeah both we could</text><text start="3043.26" dur="2.4">do both we can collaborate and</text><text start="3044.28" dur="4.74">coordinate you know I&apos;m really</text><text start="3045.66" dur="5.28">interested in I&apos;m actually I&apos;ve I&apos;ve no</text><text start="3049.02" dur="4.14">longer involved in leadership at coindao</text><text start="3050.94" dur="4.619">contributing from the edges but I wonder</text><text start="3053.16" dur="4.439">if there&apos;s a way where seed club and get</text><text start="3055.559" dur="4.201">coined out could work together in some</text><text start="3057.599" dur="3.72">way because I know that git coin grants</text><text start="3059.76" dur="5.28">is where a lot of projects in the space</text><text start="3061.319" dur="5.341">go for first seed funding and and so is</text><text start="3065.04" dur="4.14">seed club and so I wonder if there&apos;s</text><text start="3066.66" dur="5.1">kind of a way of sharing not deal flow</text><text start="3069.18" dur="5.82">but you know up and coming projects</text><text start="3071.76" dur="5.46">between the two dials and uh I can only</text><text start="3075.0" dur="4.079">Wonder out loud and in front of all the</text><text start="3077.22" dur="3.66">podcast listeners what that looks like</text><text start="3079.079" dur="4.381">but maybe something will come together</text><text start="3080.88" dur="4.02">over time between the two communities</text><text start="3083.46" dur="3.72">yeah I&apos;ve definitely been thinking about</text><text start="3084.9" dur="3.659">that a lot as I&apos;ve seen uh some of the</text><text start="3087.18" dur="3.12">conversation online in the last little</text><text start="3088.559" dur="3.181">while and I think you know what we want</text><text start="3090.3" dur="3.66">to do is make sure that we have like the</text><text start="3091.74" dur="4.079">the human capital and and the knowledge</text><text start="3093.96" dur="3.599">to sort of support teams and and the</text><text start="3095.819" dur="3.181">hard work of going from you know the</text><text start="3097.559" dur="3.601">idea to building a meaningful</text><text start="3099.0" dur="3.54">organization in the space and we can get</text><text start="3101.16" dur="4.439">really good at that</text><text start="3102.54" dur="4.559">um that&apos;s the type of value that I would</text><text start="3105.599" dur="4.921">be very excited to to see how we could</text><text start="3107.099" dur="6.121">bring to a sort of similar ecosystems</text><text start="3110.52" dur="4.14">yeah gag almost Vision uh and I&apos;m just</text><text start="3113.22" dur="3.119">wondering I&apos;m wondering out loud about</text><text start="3114.66" dur="2.88">this but you know like I almost imagine</text><text start="3116.339" dur="3.181">that</text><text start="3117.54" dur="3.9">anyone could mine the get coin Grant</text><text start="3119.52" dur="4.44">status at once it&apos;s grants 2.0 it&apos;s</text><text start="3121.44" dur="4.139">totally decentralized for you could mine</text><text start="3123.96" dur="3.899">the grand status set of okay what are</text><text start="3125.579" dur="4.201">the top up and coming projects uh in the</text><text start="3127.859" dur="3.48">ethereum ecosystem through get coin</text><text start="3129.78" dur="3.6">grants you you funnel those into a c</text><text start="3131.339" dur="3.901">Club application and we we just pass</text><text start="3133.38" dur="4.14">those off into seed club and you know</text><text start="3135.24" dur="4.14">get coin incubated get code incubated</text><text start="3137.52" dur="3.12">and incubator and kernel also and I</text><text start="3139.38" dur="4.86">think that there&apos;s also an opportunity</text><text start="3140.64" dur="4.74">there to to to sort of be a a progenator</text><text start="3144.24" dur="4.079">of projects that go through both</text><text start="3145.38" dur="4.56">accelerators and so so yeah maybe that&apos;s</text><text start="3148.319" dur="3.361">what the the relationship will look like</text><text start="3149.94" dur="3.119">over time but</text><text start="3151.68" dur="3.419">um in the meantime just just looking</text><text start="3153.059" dur="4.981">forward to vibing with you on on regen</text><text start="3155.099" dur="5.101">stuff and impact owls and uh and we can</text><text start="3158.04" dur="4.92">take it from there yeah I love it you</text><text start="3160.2" dur="4.56">know folks are applications are opening</text><text start="3162.96" dur="3.24">on August 1st but that also allows for</text><text start="3164.76" dur="4.02">people to come in and actually see who&apos;s</text><text start="3166.2" dur="4.859">applied at comments help up vote help us</text><text start="3168.78" dur="4.02">choose
