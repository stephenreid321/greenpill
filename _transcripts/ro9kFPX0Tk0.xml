who</text><text start="36.3" dur="4.86">are skilled at reading between the lines</text><text start="37.98" dur="5.88">this is a tough episode to produce in</text><text start="41.16" dur="3.96">the wake of the FTX implosion last week</text><text start="43.86" dur="4.32">and I think that a lot of people in this</text><text start="45.12" dur="5.279">industry are licking their wounds and</text><text start="48.18" dur="3.66">thinking about the just the massive</text><text start="50.399" dur="6.3">amount of capital destruction that was</text><text start="51.84" dur="7.62">caused by SBF and a structure at FTX</text><text start="56.699" dur="4.261">that resembled more Trad five and D5 so</text><text start="59.46" dur="4.559">in this episode we talk about the social</text><text start="60.96" dur="4.8">causes of crypto we talk about the</text><text start="64.019" dur="4.861">tension between crypto being money games</text><text start="65.76" dur="4.859">and crypto having

dur="4.44">tweet</text><text start="298.38" dur="5.4">yeah I think a lot of the industry went</text><text start="301.5" dur="5.94">into a moment of reflection after FTX</text><text start="303.78" dur="5.58">and I think it&apos;s really because it was</text><text start="307.44" dur="4.86">the third of three major events that</text><text start="309.36" dur="5.279">were kind of similar ish</text><text start="312.3" dur="3.839">um three AC the destruction of three</text><text start="314.639" dur="3.961">years Capital the destruction of Terra</text><text start="316.139" dur="4.321">Luna now the destruction of FTX it was</text><text start="318.6" dur="4.02">just like man this</text><text start="320.46" dur="6.6">this keeps on happening man like this is</text><text start="322.62" dur="6.299">this is what 2022 was uh and so uh it</text><text start="327.06" dur="3.359">just it took me just like a moment of</text><text start="328.919" dur="4.081">reflection be like</text><text start="330.419" dur="4.201">it seems to have dominated 2022 just</text><text start="333.0" dur="3.12">seems to be dominated by just people</text><text start="334.62" dur="3.6">losing money</text><text start="336.12" dur="4.38">um yeah and in an industry that is</text><text start="338.22" dur="5.58">supposed to be about like you know</text><text start="340.5" dur="5.16">self-sovereign asset owning and uh you</text><text start="343.8" dur="5.16">know permissionless Freedom it&apos;s like</text><text start="345.66" dur="6.12">we&apos;re not using we have the tools that</text><text start="348.96" dur="5.4">have been specifically built to prevent</text><text start="351.78" dur="5.4">this and then it seems to actually</text><text start="354.36" dur="5.16">enable it somehow uh and I think I was</text><text start="357.18" dur="3.42">just like in the mind I think me and a</text><text start="359.52" dur="3.42">lot of the industry would have just in</text><text start="360.6" dur="6.12">this mind state of just like momentary</text><text start="362.94" dur="6.96">capitulation of just like damn man like</text><text start="366.72" dur="4.979">sweet the theoretical use cases of</text><text start="369.9" dur="4.139">crypto are amazing</text><text start="371.699" dur="5.881">but everything bad that&apos;s happened about</text><text start="374.039" dur="4.88">crypto happened in 2022 uh and so like</text><text start="377.58" dur="4.2">taking just like</text><text start="378.919" dur="4.56">and I I love everyone in crypto because</text><text start="381.78" dur="4.56">we&apos;re all futurists right we&apos;re all</text><text start="383.479" dur="5.681">idealists uh we&apos;re all we&apos;re optimist</text><text start="386.34" dur="4.919">about the future uh but then like 2022</text><text start="389.16" dur="4.319">comes and punches you in the gut and</text><text start="391.259" dur="4.201">then another time and then another time</text><text start="393.479" dur="3.72">and it&apos;s like all right well like me and</text><text start="395.46" dur="3.54">Ryan we call ourselves like storytellers</text><text start="397.199" dur="3.601">like we&apos;re trying to get people to be on</text><text start="399.0" dur="3.479">the bank list Journey right so we got to</text><text start="400.8" dur="6.239">tell the story because that&apos;s how humans</text><text start="402.479" dur="5.881">learn things uh and it&apos;s like sweet like</text><text start="407.039" dur="2.94">that&apos;s we&apos;re just we&apos;re just making</text><text start="408.36" dur="3.6">something out of nothing right we&apos;re</text><text start="409.979" dur="4.5">just we&apos;re just making it up uh and</text><text start="411.96" dur="4.14">hoping it sticks and meanwhile like</text><text start="414.479" dur="4.201">people keep on losing money to things</text><text start="416.1" dur="4.439">like Tara Luna and FTX and like dokwan</text><text start="418.68" dur="4.5">and all that stuff uh so it&apos;s just like</text><text start="420.539" dur="4.321">a moment of like frustration about some</text><text start="423.18" dur="2.519">of just yeah some of the bad stuff I</text><text start="424.86" dur="2.76">guess</text><text start="425.699" dur="4.201">yeah thanks for that David you know I I</text><text start="427.62" dur="3.84">think it&apos;s clear when I talk to you that</text><text start="429.9" dur="3.6">we believe that crypto can be good for</text><text start="431.46" dur="4.38">the world and I&apos;d like to make this</text><text start="433.5" dur="4.74">episode about how it how it actually</text><text start="435.84" dur="3.96">achieves that that goal of being good</text><text start="438.24" dur="4.32">for the world and so I&apos;d love to hear</text><text start="439.8" dur="5.16">from you on next about how FTX hit you</text><text start="442.56" dur="6.3">and as a long-term Builder what your</text><text start="444.96" dur="5.94">take is on the FTX implosion</text><text start="448.86" dur="5.22">yeah look at I&apos;m tremendously</text><text start="450.9" dur="5.579">disappointed I think it is a a huge</text><text start="454.08" dur="4.739">disaster for for our community in in the</text><text start="456.479" dur="4.141">ways that were totally preventable uh</text><text start="458.819" dur="3.121">like our community and what we&apos;ve been</text><text start="460.62" dur="3.72">building with for crypto stands</text><text start="461.94" dur="5.159">precisely against the kind of problems</text><text start="464.34" dur="5.4">that led to this downfall</text><text start="467.099" dur="4.88">um you know I&apos;ve been around since very</text><text start="469.74" dur="4.32">early like before</text><text start="471.979" dur="4.181">2012-13 is when I started getting into</text><text start="474.06" dur="4.62">into Bitcoin and and crypto and so on</text><text start="476.16" dur="5.039">and a lot of it is about creating public</text><text start="478.68" dur="6.0">verifiable structures where you do not</text><text start="481.199" dur="5.34">have to trust people to act uh correctly</text><text start="484.68" dur="3.54">and so on and I think what what is</text><text start="486.539" dur="3.961">especially disappointing is</text><text start="488.22" dur="4.919">how many good things we&apos;re getting</text><text start="490.5" dur="4.74">starting to get funded that now are</text><text start="493.139" dur="3.9">totally destroyed because of this</text><text start="495.24" dur="3.06">um and just a huge overhang that&apos;s going</text><text start="497.039" dur="3.481">to come into the whole community and so</text><text start="498.3" dur="3.36">I it feels like we&apos;ve on one so amount</text><text start="500.52" dur="3.84">of work now</text><text start="501.66" dur="4.379">um to your question this is precisely</text><text start="504.36" dur="5.04">why we&apos;re here like I think if anything</text><text start="506.039" dur="5.641">this is a massive reminder of the work</text><text start="509.4" dur="3.84">that we&apos;re doing and why it matters the</text><text start="511.68" dur="3.84">fact that these kinds of mistakes should</text><text start="513.24" dur="4.38">not happen and where we can build</text><text start="515.52" dur="4.379">economies that are free of this kind of</text><text start="517.62" dur="5.339">mistake and this kind of uh just beyond</text><text start="519.899" dur="5.341">mistaken right this is uh it&apos;s unclear</text><text start="522.959" dur="4.081">still what everything exact how</text><text start="525.24" dur="3.9">everything exactly happened but there&apos;s</text><text start="527.04" dur="4.02">at least significant evidence of serious</text><text start="529.14" dur="4.74">fraud that should be completely</text><text start="531.06" dur="4.74">avoidable with cryptographic Primitives</text><text start="533.88" dur="3.959">um and this is why we why we build these</text><text start="535.8" dur="3.96">things this is we&apos;re not here for C5</text><text start="537.839" dur="4.021">we&apos;re here for D5 at least and I&apos;m</text><text start="539.76"

who are using it</text><text start="699.12" dur="4.14">casually see for me is maybe a starting</text><text start="701.399" dur="4.021">point in recognizing the vantage point</text><text start="703.26"

start="709.68" dur="4.74">um you know I really think that this was</text><text start="711.959" dur="3.781">totally avoidable</text><text start="714.42" dur="4.32">um by</text><text start="715.74" dur="5.52">uh forcing a certain set of Standards</text><text start="718.74" dur="3.3">from within our community about what uh</text><text start="721.26" dur="2.819">different kinds of

dur="4.739">requiring those when we were kind of</text><text start="741.6" dur="3.9">um supporting and promoting a lot of</text><text start="743.459" dur="3.541">these groups uh and so sort of you know</text><text start="745.5" dur="2.22">a lot of people</text><text start="747.0" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="747.72" dur="5.88">kind of have a lot of trust in in</text><text start="750.24" dur="4.68">community leaders on kind of where to go</text><text start="753.6" dur="3.06">and what products are good and so on and</text><text start="754.92" dur="4.2">having our own notion of

dur="3.9">values and the and has public</text><text start="763.38" dur="2.82">verifiability</text><text start="764.88" dur="4.32">um that&apos;s something that we can build</text><text start="766.2" dur="4.68">ourselves uh and the other part is we we</text><text start="769.2" dur="3.0">probably could have we have the</text><text start="770.88" dur="3.78">coordination tools and what group is</text><text start="772.2" dur="4.68">extremely good for is to coordinate out</text><text start="774.66" dur="3.78">of massive problems we have the</text><text start="776.88" dur="4.079">coordination tools to avert this kind of</text><text start="778.44" dur="3.959">disaster right so the I was you know</text><text start="780.959" dur="3.421">Kevin you and I talked about this but I</text><text start="782.399" dur="4.141">was sort of shocked that this week alone</text><text start="784.38" dur="5.699">the sort of crypto market cap was shaped</text><text start="786.54" dur="6.539">by you know 20 to 30 percent</text><text start="790.079" dur="5.101">um over the disaster and averting the</text><text start="793.079" dur="3.721">catastrophe probably would have been one</text><text start="795.18" dur="3.779">percent or less than one percent when it</text><text start="796.8" dur="5.58">started and we just lacked the</text><text start="798.959" dur="5.641">coordination Primitives to solve the</text><text start="802.38" dur="3.84">problem uh on the get-go</text><text start="804.6" dur="3.12">um a to prevent it in the first place</text><text start="806.22" dur="3.66">and B to</text><text start="807.72" dur="3.96">act as it&apos;s happening and so this is</text><text start="809.88" dur="3.899">something where it has made me consider</text><text start="811.68" dur="3.599">how we as a community should be what</text><text start="813.779" dur="3.721">kind of structure should we put in place</text><text start="815.279" dur="3.541">to to avoid these kinds of financial</text><text start="817.5" dur="4.139">disasters</text><text start="818.82" dur="3.84">um or kind of uh step in to take them in</text><text start="821.639" dur="3.121">a different course</text><text start="822.66" dur="4.02">um and that&apos;s a lot of possibilities</text><text start="824.76" dur="3.54">there but I think it&apos;s a</text><text start="826.68" dur="2.64">it&apos;s a stuff that I hadn&apos;t been thinking</text><text start="828.3" dur="4.38">about before</text><text start="829.32" dur="6.0">I&apos;ve always uh considered more markets</text><text start="832.68" dur="4.14">are just like this hive mind of people</text><text start="835.32" dur="3.54">right like with the market price of</text><text start="836.82" dur="3.24">something it&apos;s just like the collective</text><text start="838.86" dur="2.58">intelligence of so many different Market</text><text start="840.06" dur="3.18">participants and then boom we have a</text><text start="841.44" dur="3.959">price on the secondary Market</text><text start="843.24" dur="3.96">um like markets remember because it&apos;s</text><text start="845.399" dur="5.94">all of our Collective brains they also</text><text start="847.2" dur="6.48">have memory uh and like humans the way</text><text start="851.339" dur="4.861">our brains work is that we encode</text><text start="853.68" dur="4.2">memories much faster if there&apos;s pain</text><text start="856.2" dur="4.379">involved if there&apos;s suffering involved</text><text start="857.88" dur="5.639">and so like kind of how like Mount gox</text><text start="860.579" dur="4.621">was a meme that probably did a lot of</text><text start="863.519" dur="3.12">energy added a lot of energy to the</text><text start="865.2" dur="3.18">Bitcoin or chant of like not your keys</text><text start="866.639" dur="3.301">not your crypto there&apos;s probably going</text><text start="868.38" dur="4.199">to be that&apos;s probably what the legacy of</text><text start="869.94" dur="5.459">FTX is going to be where like it</text><text start="872.579" dur="4.56">imprints upon us like people that came</text><text start="875.399" dur="5.521">after Mount gox that didn&apos;t learn these</text><text start="877.139" dur="5.221">lessons personally uh that you know of</text><text start="880.92" dur="3.3">some of the values right so I guess we</text><text start="882.36" dur="3.9">there&apos;s there&apos;s a reason why web3 has</text><text start="884.22" dur="5.7">values why we talk about value so much</text><text start="886.26" dur="5.759">uh and sometimes in the crypto the world</text><text start="889.92" dur="4.56">things happen that are illustrative of</text><text start="892.019" dur="5.221">the whole point of why we&apos;re here uh</text><text start="894.48" dur="4.919">like exchange hacks for example uh and</text><text start="897.24" dur="4.2">sometimes like I think moments like this</text><text start="899.399" dur="4.021">is where it goes from a meme that you</text><text start="901.44" dur="4.38">hear about on like podcasts or on</text><text start="903.42" dur="4.38">Twitter into something that like you&apos;ve</text><text start="905.82" dur="3.84">actually experienced and and you can</text><text start="907.8" dur="4.08">express for yourself is like why it&apos;s</text><text start="909.66" dur="4.08">important not because I&apos;m like you know</text><text start="911.88" dur="5.34">somebody memed it on Twitter or whatever</text><text start="913.74" dur="5.88">uh it&apos;s sad that this is how humans</text><text start="917.22" dur="4.619">learn it&apos;s unfortunate that we have to</text><text start="919.62" dur="3.959">learn through like you know pain and</text><text start="921.839" dur="4.021">experiencing it firsthand rather than</text><text start="923.579" dur="5.101">just like knowing it but like maybe that</text><text start="925.86" dur="5.339">is what is the Legacy the good Legacy of</text><text start="928.68" dur="5.399">FTX is that like it&apos;s it&apos;s the new</text><text start="931.199" dur="5.58">lesson of mount gox for a much wider</text><text start="934.079" dur="4.62">broader set of people uh regardless of</text><text start="936.779" dur="2.941">whether they lost money in it or not uh</text><text start="938.699" dur="2.7">and so like</text><text start="939.72" dur="3.84">the other like kind of existential</text><text start="941.399" dur="4.44">crisis I was having Kevin is like you</text><text start="943.56" dur="3.839">know you know how the the meme of like</text><text start="945.839" dur="3.12">the cycle right and like you kind of</text><text start="947.399" dur="3.601">don&apos;t make money your first cycle you</text><text start="948.959" dur="3.301">always make money your second cycle uh</text><text start="951.0" dur="1.92">in crypto</text><text start="952.26" dur="3.66">um</text><text start="952.92" dur="4.5">and like I was just feeling like bad</text><text start="955.92" dur="3.419">about the industry because like yes</text><text start="957.42" dur="3.9">because we dump on the new site the</text><text start="959.339" dur="4.5">second cyclers dump on the first cyclers</text><text start="961.32" dur="5.28">and so like this crypto world like has</text><text start="963.839" dur="4.321">this way of just like the only way Pat</text><text start="966.6" dur="3.239">with the only path forward to actually</text><text start="968.16" dur="3.96">make this thing work is like by hurting</text><text start="969.839" dur="4.141">people like the second cyclers dump on</text><text start="972.12" dur="5.219">the first cyclers the first cyclers get</text><text start="973.98" dur="5.52">Mount gox they get ftxed like I so far I</text><text start="977.339" dur="3.541">haven&apos;t like seen crypto progress</text><text

more damage has been done by the</text><text start="991.92" dur="3.539">same group it&apos;s not kind of like last</text><text start="993.959" dur="4.261">cyclers on new cyclists or anything

uh short</text><text start="1209.78" dur="4.74">term well I want it now uh and then we</text><text start="1213.02" dur="4.56">have like a bull market we enable the</text><text start="1214.52"

the dumb monkeys are on</text><text start="1234.44" dur="5.04">ethereum uh and like it it but that just</text><text start="1237.38" dur="3.72">takes so long and like meanwhile we have</text><text start="1239.48" dur="2.939">like the short-term resume that just</text><text start="1241.1" dur="3.9">like kind of manifests and expresses</text><text start="1242.419" dur="5.161">around it yeah I mean I I think this is</text><text start="1245.0" dur="6.179">where the private versus public versus</text><text start="1247.58" dur="7.5">Network Goods differences exist so</text><text start="1251.179" dur="6.24">um at least I and I think a lot of there</text><text start="1255.08" dur="3.9">are a lot of communities that are much</text><text start="1257.419" dur="4.681">more focused on</text><text start="1258.98" dur="5.46">building better resource utilization and</text><text start="1262.1" dur="5.699">better progress and better growth not</text><text start="1264.44" dur="5.52">just kind of individually uh making more</text><text start="1267.799" dur="3.62">money and making more wealth and so the</text><text start="1269.96" dur="4.079">difference the difference here being</text><text start="1271.419" dur="5.441">individual private wealth going you know</text><text start="1274.039" dur="3.901">number go up for an individual person is</text><text start="1276.86" dur="3.42">a</text><text start="1277.94" dur="6.18">it&apos;s kind of it&apos;s a different sort of</text><text start="1280.28" dur="6.24">thing than hey what if we allocated our</text><text start="1284.12" dur="5.16">efforts better and created more</text><text start="1286.52" dur="4.019">resources better and faster and we had</text><text start="1289.28" dur="3.3">different ways of allocating them like</text><text start="1290.539" dur="4.14">at the end of the day capital is just a</text><text start="1292.58" dur="4.079">distributed system to try and resource</text><text start="1294.679" dur="3.12">allocate uh and it works is worked</text><text start="1296.659" dur="3.781">really well for the last couple hundred</text><text start="1297.799" dur="4.86">years for a lot of reasons it&apos;s really</text><text start="1300.44" dur="3.359">difficult to centrally plan we had you</text><text start="1302.659" dur="3.841">know massive experiments in central</text><text start="1303.799" dur="5.401">planning in the in the 20th century that</text><text start="1306.5" dur="6.419">totally didn&apos;t beat Capital</text><text start="1309.2" dur="4.92">um and the the point though is like the</text><text start="1312.919" dur="2.941">rules of how Capital worked today are</text><text start="1314.12" dur="4.2">broken like are very very broken if you</text><text start="1315.86" dur="4.98">look at how you know it you you can make</text><text start="1318.32" dur="4.26">dramatically more money in in the world</text><text start="1320.84" dur="4.199">by producing</text><text start="1322.58" dur="4.26">um really glitzy not long-term useful</text><text start="1325.039" dur="3.421">things that don&apos;t provide any well-being</text><text start="1326.84" dur="3.06">to anybody like when you look at you</text><text start="1328.46" dur="3.12">know reducing mortality or curing</text><text start="1329.9" dur="5.639">diseases or</text><text start="1331.58" dur="5.82">um uh reducing uh poverty uh giving</text><text start="1335.539" dur="3.181">better access to water like all of these</text><text start="1337.4" dur="4.08">really important things that are in the</text><text start="1338.72" dur="4.8">world you can make way more money by</text><text start="1341.48" dur="3.78">creating some like</text><text start="1343.52" dur="3.0">um entertaining thing that just kind of</text><text start="1345.26" dur="2.82">helps people and you know nothing bad</text><text start="1346.52" dur="2.82">against entertainment but um it&apos;s</text><text start="1348.08" dur="3.18">probably not the most valuable thing</text><text start="1349.34" dur="4.8">that anybody could be doing and it&apos;s the</text><text start="1351.26" dur="5.159">multiples of of value in how</text><text start="1354.14" dur="3.72">um you know the broader stock market and</text><text start="1356.419" dur="3.181">the broader economy values these things</text><text start="1357.86" dur="3.9">is much higher is extremely short-term</text><text start="1359.6" dur="5.28">oriented and the long-term oriented</text><text start="1361.76" dur="4.799">stuff goes uninvested in because the</text><text start="1364.88" dur="3.539">rules of capital underneath the hood are</text><text start="1366.559" dur="3.721">kind of broken and so that&apos;s what is</text><text start="1368.419" dur="4.021">extremely promising to me about crypto</text><text start="1370.28" dur="5.1">and it&apos;s already to a great extent</text><text start="1372.44" dur="4.56">already making significant advances here</text><text start="1375.38" dur="3.299">um it&apos;s enabling lots of groups that are</text><text start="1377.0" dur="4.08">much more long-term oriented to build</text><text start="1378.679" dur="4.5">these institutions and these these</text><text start="1381.08" dur="5.04">structures on the internet that don&apos;t</text><text start="1383.179" dur="5.161">depend on them that are that are</text><text start="1386.12" dur="3.9">creating these long-term oriented</text><text start="1388.34" dur="3.54">um digital infrastructure that can give</text><text start="1390.02" dur="4.139">you digital human rights</text><text start="1391.88" dur="3.96">um and that&apos;s a super super cool cool</text><text start="1394.159" dur="3.14">possibility</text><text start="1395.84" dur="3.9">um and hey that&apos;s how you gotta get into</text><text start="1397.299" dur="3.941">rewriting capital and and getting to a</text><text start="1399.74" dur="4.14">much better</text><text start="1401.24" dur="4.5">um better place the bridge for me</text><text start="1403.88" dur="4.02">between what Juan said and what David</text><text start="1405.74" dur="3.66">said is this idea</text><text start="1407.9" dur="3.36">um that ENC strickler came up with</text><text start="1409.4" dur="5.1">called bentoism it stands for Beyond</text><text start="1411.26" dur="7.14">near or near-term orientation and it&apos;s</text><text start="1414.5" dur="7.2">basically going from being incentivized</text><text start="1418.4" dur="6.12">by now me what&apos;s good for me now to</text><text start="1421.7" dur="4.92">what&apos;s good for us now and then there&apos;s</text><text start="1424.52" dur="5.1">another Vector which is which is the</text><text start="1426.62" dur="5.939">future which is future me and then the</text><text start="1429.62" dur="4.62">fourth quadrant is future us and and so</text><text start="1432.559" dur="4.86">basically if if you&apos;re in a market where</text><text start="1434.24" dur="5.46">99 of the you know to use David&apos;s term</text><text start="1437.419" dur="3.961">dumb monkeys are just focused on Naomi</text><text start="1439.7" dur="3.12">in the marshmallow test there&apos;s is</text><text start="1441.38" dur="2.88">actually like a market advantage to</text><text start="1442.82" dur="4.38">being someone who doesn&apos;t think like</text><text start="1444.26" dur="5.46">that and moves to Future us or future me</text><text start="1447.2" dur="4.74">and and you know maybe this is how this</text><text start="1449.72" dur="4.68">system evolves forward is as all the</text><text start="1451.94" dur="5.16">gains from failing the marshmallow test</text><text start="1454.4" dur="5.82">and from being incentive from just going</text><text start="1457.1" dur="5.4">for for now me dry up then the market</text><text start="1460.22" dur="4.199">matures and it moves towards a more</text><text start="1462.5" dur="5.1">mature Market cycle which is focused on</text><text start="1464.419" dur="5.461">uh Squad wealth and groups and in longer</text><text start="1467.6" dur="5.16">term orientation and that&apos;s where the</text><text start="1469.88" dur="4.38">real uh advancement in the space happens</text><text start="1472.76" dur="3.299">in the alignment between the capital</text><text start="1474.26" dur="3.539">cycle and the actual things that are</text><text start="1476.059" dur="3.721">good for the world and the other analogy</text><text start="1477.799" dur="4.981">that I sort of use is evolution if more</text><text start="1479.78" dur="4.74">people choose uh us in the future</text><text start="1482.78" dur="3.54">doesn&apos;t that also create a market</text><text start="1484.52" dur="4.139">opportunity for someone to defect from</text><text start="1486.32" dur="3.9">that and go back to being me now</text><text start="1488.659" dur="3.121">yeah I mean I think it depends on the</text><text start="1490.22" dur="3.9">market structure and whether those</text><text start="1491.78" dur="4.98">opportunities have have dried up or not</text><text start="1494.12" dur="3.9">go ahead one I think I think it&apos;s that</text><text start="1496.76" dur="3.0">what we should be shooting for is</text><text start="1498.02" dur="4.2">creating structures where you create</text><text start="1499.76" dur="4.26">alignment between the short-term uh</text><text start="1502.22" dur="4.98">incentive Behavior and the long-term</text><text start="1504.02" dur="7.139">utility so a concrete example about this</text><text start="1507.2" dur="5.76">is how how uh Bitcoin itself solved the</text><text start="1511.159" dur="4.02">the kind of bootstrapping of the network</text><text start="1512.96" dur="4.5">problem you create a very short-term</text><text start="1515.179" dur="4.441">oriented incentive for participants to</text><text start="1517.46" dur="4.199">go and mine Bitcoin out of the out of</text><text start="1519.62" dur="4.14">the ether in a sense</text><text start="1521.659" dur="4.161">um and you then</text><text start="1523.76" dur="5.34">create a way for</text><text start="1525.82" dur="4.959">alignment of the broader Network and the</text><text start="1529.1" dur="4.26">security of the network and the broader</text><text start="1530.779" dur="4.441">distribution of the network and like</text><text start="1533.36" dur="3.12">that&apos;s what we should be it&apos;s way harder</text><text start="1535.22" dur="2.76">to shoot for that because you have to</text><text start="1536.48" dur="3.48">discard a ton of mechanisms that are</text><text start="1537.98" dur="3.0">that are going to be either it&apos;s way</text><text start="1539.96" dur="2.28">easier if you&apos;re solving for one thing</text><text start="1540.98" dur="2.22">either short term or long term it&apos;s way</text><text start="1542.24" dur="2.52">harder if you&apos;re trying to solve for</text><text start="1543.2" dur="3.839">both but if we can create structures</text><text start="1544.76" dur="5.039">that align those incentives where our</text><text start="1547.039" dur="5.161">individual marginal short-term return is</text><text start="1549.799" dur="4.26">what produces the good long-term results</text><text start="1552.2" dur="4.099">like that&apos;s that&apos;s the promise it&apos;s like</text><text start="1554.059" dur="4.86">can we if we can build better</text><text start="1556.299" dur="3.941">infrastructure like that and better</text><text start="1558.919" dur="3.12">um economic Primitives and better</text><text start="1560.24" dur="2.34">services and better</text><text start="1562.039" dur="3.901">um</text><text start="1562.58" dur="4.5">uh yeah a better com economy it can get</text><text start="1565.94" dur="3.0">you there</text><text start="1567.08" dur="4.199">um that&apos;s that&apos;s what I think is</text><text start="1568.94" dur="3.78">is super cool about not just cool it&apos;s</text><text start="1571.279" dur="4.201">like it&apos;s a</text><text start="1572.72" dur="4.98">uh extremely promising and</text><text start="1575.48" dur="4.5">already having impact I think it&apos;s to</text><text start="1577.7" dur="4.8">the question about the accounting of</text><text start="1579.98" dur="4.079">um you know how the sort of get the</text><text start="1582.5" dur="2.76">utility and the benefits versus the</text><text start="1584.059" dur="2.701">damage</text><text start="1585.26" dur="3.419">um my sense on all of this is like</text><text start="1586.76" dur="4.5">crypto comes out dramatically ahead on</text><text start="1588.679" dur="5.041">on benefit uh even despite all of these</text><text start="1591.26" dur="5.58">big problems because of the utility</text><text

start="1768.14" dur="3.96">that I mean the the positive</text><text start="1770.779" dur="3.601">um ability for people in Argentina</text><text start="1772.1" dur="5.16">access USD from anywhere do

dur="3.9">those are all things that exist today</text><text start="1780.26" dur="4.38">like uniswap exists today and so I don&apos;t</text><text start="1782.6" dur="3.54">totally buy that but I do think that one</text><text start="1784.64" dur="3.899">thing we have to be mindful of an</text><text start="1786.14" dur="4.08">industry is like pushing we need to</text><text start="1788.539" dur="4.561">start realizing those those positive</text><text start="1790.22" dur="6.059">externalities soon and and start scaling</text><text start="1793.1" dur="5.939">them up to be at like FTX 50 billion</text><text start="1796.279" dur="4.981">dollar scale I think</text><text start="1799.039" dur="4.26">yeah there&apos;s also the problem that uh</text><text start="1801.26" dur="3.84">all the good things in the world become</text><text start="1803.299" dur="4.681">normal and then all the bad things in</text><text start="1805.1" dur="4.92">the news bad things in the world go on</text><text start="1807.98" dur="4.079">the news like at least it leads right</text><text start="1810.02" dur="4.139">and so like there&apos;s also just like a</text><text start="1812.059" dur="3.901">public perception crisis and like in the</text><text start="1814.159" dur="3.361">in in Technologies in their infancy it&apos;s</text><text start="1815.96" dur="3.66">like super easy to hate on them right</text><text start="1817.52" dur="3.72">like it&apos;s so easy you can just like go</text><text start="1819.62" dur="3.179">to Reddit right now and be like nft is</text><text start="1821.24"

start="1827.659" dur="2.701">that&apos;s probably why I felt like so</text><text start="1828.799" dur="3.301">demoralized this last week and so many</text><text start="1830.36" dur="3.539">in the crypto industry kind of said they</text><text start="1832.1" dur="4.199">felt the same as like</text><text start="1833.899" dur="4.741">there&apos;s like what do we take to the</text><text

of my industry I&apos;m proud of what I</text><text start="1844.399" dur="5.581">do here uh and like there are very real</text><text start="1847.159" dur="4.441">things like remittance is sick like uh</text><text start="1849.98" dur="4.439">argentines getting out of inflation</text><text start="1851.6" dur="4.74">saving people&apos;s lives but like you take</text><text start="1854.419" dur="4.081">it home and people like oh honey I heard</text><text start="1856.34" dur="4.14">like the the Sam bankman guy like ran</text><text start="1858.5" dur="3.72">off to Argentina with uh 10 billion</text><text start="1860.48" dur="4.14">dollars of people&apos;s deposits and like</text><text start="1862.22" dur="5.52">it&apos;s and like even when you know</text><text start="1864.62" dur="4.74">everything&apos;s like the everything is like</text><text start="1867.74" dur="2.64">the real stuff is is there it&apos;s like</text><text start="1869.36" dur="2.52">hard to</text><text start="1870.38" dur="4.98">it&apos;s like hard to keep on fighting it</text><text start="1871.88" dur="6.48">man it especially hard in countries</text><text start="1875.36" dur="5.039">where uh you have a good Financial stack</text><text start="1878.36" dur="3.48">right so a lot of our perspective comes</text><text start="1880.399" dur="3.181">from eight countries that have good</text><text start="1881.84" dur="4.319">Financial Stacks I was born and grew up</text><text start="1883.58" dur="4.74">in Mexico in a place where</text><text start="1886.159" dur="4.62">um you know it has a lot it&apos;s an amazing</text><text start="1888.32" dur="4.979">country really uh natural resource</text><text start="1890.779" dur="4.681">wealthy uh amazing people everywhere</text><text start="1893.299" dur="4.201">super thoughtful long-term oriented in a</text><text start="1895.46" dur="4.14">lot of ways super Community oriented uh</text><text start="1897.5" dur="4.08">and yet massive amount of corruption in</text><text start="1899.6" dur="3.9">governments and in other systems that</text><text start="1901.58" dur="4.319">has created a financial stack that is</text><text start="1903.5" dur="4.74">not aligned with long-term success for</text><text start="1905.899" dur="4.5">communities and is aligned with bribery</text><text start="1908.24" dur="4.14">and Corruption all the way through</text><text start="1910.399" dur="4.981">um and so just the idea that you could</text><text start="1912.38" dur="4.5">have a community of people gathering</text><text start="1915.38" dur="4.019">together</text><text start="1916.88" dur="4.56">um their resources and having it in a</text><text start="1919.399" dur="5.341">secure environment that is not gonna</text><text start="1921.44" dur="4.739">like disappear overnight because like</text><text start="1924.74" dur="3.299">the bank happened to you know have</text><text start="1926.179" dur="2.88">somebody corrupt there that rather the</text><text start="1928.039" dur="3.421">money somewhere else or something like</text><text start="1929.059" dur="3.901">that is a massive massive Improvement</text><text start="1931.46" dur="2.939">and</text><text start="1932.96" dur="3.54">um you know you can sure there&apos;s like a</text><text start="1934.399" dur="2.64">you know 50x 50 billion</text><text start="1936.5" dur="3.779">um</text><text start="1937.039" dur="6.061">problem but there&apos;s the you know</text><text start="1940.279" dur="4.681">trillion dollar level amount of value</text><text start="1943.1" dur="3.72">created in this broader economy and how</text><text start="1944.96" dur="4.8">much of that is</text><text start="1946.82" dur="4.92">um which ideally segmented out to</text><text start="1949.76" dur="2.88">understand how much of that is</text><text start="1951.74" dur="3.179">um kind of financial instrument</text><text start="1952.64" dur="4.32">speculation versus these broader</text><text start="1954.919" dur="4.441">important use cases and and kind of</text><text start="1956.96" dur="4.02">understand have like the real kpis</text><text start="1959.36" dur="3.6">um that&apos;s something maybe that we can do</text><text start="1960.98" dur="3.059">is like create a a kind of here are the</text><text start="1962.96" dur="3.18">crypto kpis that we should all be</text><text start="1964.039" dur="3.36">shooting for uh to create utility for</text><text start="1966.14" dur="3.24">the world what are we aiming for as a</text><text start="1967.399" dur="3.961">community and and what&apos;s an honest</text><text start="1969.38" dur="3.6">rating of where we are and where we&apos;re</text><text start="1971.36" dur="4.08">headed</text><text start="1972.98" dur="5.16">I think it&apos;s probably also important to</text><text start="1975.44" dur="4.08">remember that this was just like one guy</text><text start="1978.14" dur="3.779">who</text><text start="1979.52" dur="4.139">like would didn&apos;t care about crypto to</text><text start="1981.919" dur="3.841">begin with right that was like a lot of</text><text start="1983.659" dur="4.201">people&apos;s critiques of SPF from the</text><text start="1985.76" dur="3.659">get-go is like the guy openly admits</text><text start="1987.86" dur="3.059">that he&apos;s just in crypto for the</text><text start="1989.419" dur="6.38">opportunity like he told that to our</text><text start="1990.919" dur="9.24">faces uh and and so like you know Enron</text><text start="1995.799" dur="6.641">uh like Lehman uh SBF and FTX these are</text><text start="2000.159" dur="3.541">just like one sets of entities I don&apos;t</text><text start="2002.44" dur="3.3">know if there&apos;s anybody specifically</text><text start="2003.7" dur="4.8">malicious at Lehman but like Bernie</text><text start="2005.74" dur="5.4">Madoff for example or like these are</text><text start="2008.5" dur="5.64">just like one just one like lunatic one</text><text start="2011.14" dur="5.1">like sociopath lunatic who uh did this</text><text start="2014.14" dur="4.5">and like crypto is actually technically</text><text start="2016.24" dur="4.74">like just adjacent to that fact rather</text><text start="2018.64" dur="4.139">than a core part of it like it&apos;s</text><text start="2020.98" dur="3.48">interesting that we all feel compelled</text><text start="2022.779" dur="3.421">to like come on and like start to like</text><text start="2024.46" dur="3.599">uh you know make sure we&apos;re legitimizing</text><text start="2026.2" dur="4.079">web 3 when it&apos;s actually just like this</text><text start="2028.059" dur="4.261">one lunatic in a bank who run out ran</text><text start="2030.279" dur="3.541">off with 10 billion dollars is making us</text><text start="2032.32" dur="3.78">feel this way</text><text start="2033.82" dur="3.78">um like each one of those like the</text><text start="2036.1" dur="3.84">ponzis that happened in the traffic</text><text start="2037.6" dur="4.799">world ended up ultimately coming to</text><text start="2039.94" dur="4.32">bring like regulation but maybe if I&apos;m</text><text start="2042.399" dur="5.101">like thinking with like Rosy colored</text><text start="2044.26" dur="5.639">glasses like well fine then like let&apos;s</text><text start="2047.5" dur="4.56">do it because crypto knows how to it&apos;s</text><text start="2049.899" dur="4.801">how to regulate ourselves and we have a</text><text start="2052.06" dur="5.819">very strong presence in Congress or in</text><text start="2054.7" dur="5.159">in just like in that legal side of the</text><text start="2057.879" dur="3.421">world uh where I mean I think we&apos;re good</text><text start="2059.859" dur="2.82">at that and we&apos;ve been asking for it for</text><text start="2061.3" dur="4.02">a really long time so maybe there&apos;s some</text><text start="2062.679" dur="4.321">good good Silver Lining here yeah I mean</text><text start="2065.32" dur="4.92">I think as long as The Regulators are</text><text start="2067.0" dur="5.58">educated and the political process in</text><text start="2070.24" dur="5.52">Washington works you know I I and and</text><text start="2072.58" dur="4.92">let&apos;s keep in mind that SPF and FTX was</text><text start="2075.76" dur="3.899">C5</text><text start="2077.5" dur="4.679">um whereas you know regulating defy I</text><text start="2079.659" dur="4.2">think is a whole another animal right so</text><text start="2082.179" dur="3.66">um and this might be a useful</text><text start="2083.859" dur="3.54">conversation starter to emphasize that</text><text start="2085.839" dur="3.361">point between defy and C5 that we need</text><text start="2087.399" dur="4.2">The Regulators to understand</text><text start="2089.2" dur="4.219">mm-hmm yeah absolutely that&apos;s a great</text><text start="2091.599" dur="4.5">starting point</text><text start="2093.419" dur="5.141">we we probably should have a a website</text><text start="2096.099" dur="4.921">that describes the you know like here&apos;s</text><text start="2098.56" dur="3.96">what C5 is here&apos;s what D5 is uh here&apos;s</text><text start="2101.02" dur="4.44">what refi is</text><text start="2102.52" dur="4.68">um yeah I would look to coin Center and</text><text start="2105.46" dur="4.8">others like them to kind of educate us</text><text start="2107.2" dur="4.68">on how like I&apos;ve DM them and like let me</text><text start="2110.26" dur="3.9">go on a green pill tour of Capitol Hill</text><text start="2111.88" dur="3.84">and I have a list of 100 different</text><text start="2114.16" dur="4.5">projects that are good for the world and</text><text start="2115.72" dur="5.22">crypto and I just want them to see</text><text start="2118.66" dur="4.5">that you know if they squash this</text><text start="2120.94" dur="4.139">industry what they&apos;ll what they&apos;ll be</text><text start="2123.16" dur="3.3">losing but uh you know I think that we</text><text start="2125.079" dur="4.561">have to really follow coin Center&apos;s lead</text><text start="2126.46" dur="4.8">there yeah and blockchain station might</text><text start="2129.64" dur="3.66">be another good group uh that you can</text><text start="2131.26" dur="2.88">talk to about that uh they work a lot</text><text start="2133.3" dur="3.66">with</text><text start="2134.14" dur="4.92">um with Regulators both in in the US and</text><text start="2136.96" dur="2.879">and outside and uh</text><text start="2139.06" dur="2.16">um</text><text start="2139.839" dur="6.601">look I think right now it&apos;s an industry</text><text start="2141.22" dur="7.139">we need to uh get super clear about the</text><text start="2146.44" dur="3.48">difference between C5 and D5 because</text><text start="2148.359" dur="3.421">what is</text><text start="2149.92" dur="4.14">um the kind of knee-jerk reaction here</text><text start="2151.78" dur="6.059">is going to be to say oh look</text><text start="2154.06" dur="5.76">um FDX crypto disaster spell bad and we</text><text start="2157.839" dur="3.481">need to be uh make a hundred percent</text><text start="2159.82" dur="4.019">clear and obvious to everybody in the</text><text start="2161.32" dur="6.0">world that this happened because of</text><text start="2163.839" dur="6.481">traditional Finance rules not because of</text><text start="2167.32" dur="5.64">crypto rules I mean yeah FTX was just</text><text start="2170.32" dur="4.74">kind of Trad fire on on crypto rails</text><text start="2172.96" dur="4.98">yeah</text><text start="2175.06" dur="4.74">yeah it&apos;s like of course it&apos;s like this</text><text start="2177.94" dur="3.899">is precisely why we&apos;re here it&apos;s like so</text><text start="2179.8" dur="3.96">that you don&apos;t have to trust people to</text><text start="2181.839" dur="3.601">agree on what they wrote on a document</text><text start="2183.76" dur="3.72">right like what happened here at the end</text><text start="2185.44" dur="3.96">of the day is a set of people were</text><text start="2187.48" dur="4.139">supposed to be bound by certain rules</text><text start="2189.4" dur="4.56">and restrictions and they said they were</text><text start="2191.619" dur="4.141">going to do X on paper and they signed</text><text start="2193.96" dur="3.78">it many people and it&apos;s not just SPF</text><text start="2195.76" dur="3.12">there&apos;s a lot of people here many people</text><text start="2197.74" dur="3.06">did this</text><text start="2198.88" dur="4.32">and yet they went and did something</text><text start="2200.8" dur="5.34">different and that is precisely why</text><text start="2203.2" dur="5.82">we&apos;re here so that we can have math that</text><text start="2206.14" dur="5.699">prevents that so that nobody can lie</text><text start="2209.02" dur="4.26">like that nobody can have the ability to</text><text start="2211.839" dur="3.301">take customer funds and move them</text><text start="2213.28" dur="3.72">somewhere else and look it&apos;s hard like</text><text start="2215.14" dur="3.18">uh you know there&apos;s been a lot of you</text><text start="2217.0" dur="2.22">know another area that we need to</text><text start="2218.32" dur="4.44">improve is</text><text start="2219.22" dur="5.28">making things way less hackable way</text><text start="2222.76" dur="3.12">better smart contract security yeah so</text><text start="2224.5" dur="3.359">that it&apos;s not as hard like the reason</text><text start="2225.88" dur="4.739">people go to these C5 things is because</text><text start="2227.859" dur="5.22">they feel safer in some regards than</text><text start="2230.619" dur="4.141">some of it&apos;s the bridges that do the do</text><text start="2233.079" dur="3.961">this for me I know how to write a smart</text><text start="2234.76" dur="5.579">contract without re-entrancy attacks but</text><text start="2237.04" dur="4.98">all these Bridge exploits are uh are</text><text start="2240.339" dur="3.721">really are really scary but it seems</text><text start="2242.02" dur="3.48">like so far most of the VCS behind the</text><text start="2244.06" dur="3.779">bridge teams will bail them out so that</text><text start="2245.5" dur="4.14">there&apos;s no customer loss funds so it&apos;s a</text><text start="2247.839" dur="3.121">little bit different though they will</text><text start="2249.64" dur="3.6">until they won&apos;t</text><text start="2250.96" dur="3.659">yeah well you know if we&apos;re gonna if my</text><text start="2253.24" dur="4.08">if we&apos;re gonna bet on modular</text><text start="2254.619" dur="4.381">blockchains as a foundational layer I</text><text start="2257.32" dur="4.32">just think that the bridges need to get</text><text start="2259.0" dur="4.94">an order of magnitude easier to to use</text><text start="2261.64" dur="5.219">and more secure</text><text start="2263.94" dur="4.179">on that note I think really the solution</text><text start="2266.859" dur="2.881">for that is actually just removing the</text><text start="2268.119" dur="2.701">bridges uh there should just be no</text><text start="2269.74" dur="3.9">Bridges</text><text start="2270.82" dur="4.86">um and I guess is that possible with a</text><text start="2273.64" dur="4.62">layer two I think it&apos;s I think it&apos;s</text><text start="2275.68" dur="5.399">possible inside</text><text start="2278.26" dur="4.2">I like optimism&apos;s code reuse strategy of</text><text start="2281.079" dur="2.581">modularity where like they have</text><text start="2282.46" dur="2.7">different modules and you use that same</text><text start="2283.66" dur="3.24">module over and over and over again I</text><text start="2285.16" dur="4.26">think like modularity is like a probably</text><text start="2286.9" dur="3.78">an important like step to ensuring uh</text><text start="2289.42" dur="2.939">secure code</text><text start="2290.68" dur="4.02">um but maybe it&apos;s like the steam engine</text><text start="2292.359" dur="5.341">man maybe but you can always create a</text><text start="2294.7" dur="5.159">derivative in both spots that have some</text><text start="2297.7" dur="4.379">that that track some Oracle somewhere</text><text start="2299.859" dur="4.98">and so on like I I don&apos;t think you can</text><text start="2302.079" dur="4.621">like there&apos;s one economy on the planet</text><text start="2304.839" dur="5.581">uh right like Humanity has one economy</text><text start="2306.7" dur="7.32">it has subparts and you can try and</text><text start="2310.42" dur="4.86">increase or decrease couplings and yeah</text><text start="2314.02" dur="3.36">we should definitely shouldn&apos;t have a</text><text start="2315.28" dur="4.38">bunch of unsafe Bridges</text><text start="2317.38" dur="5.1">um and maybe we should be decreasing the</text><text start="2319.66" dur="4.5">use of bridges for now while we figure</text><text start="2322.48" dur="3.42">out how to get them right</text><text start="2324.16" dur="3.0">um right but if somebody wants to move</text><text start="2325.9" dur="3.12">around value they&apos;re going to be able to</text><text start="2327.16" dur="3.48">move around value with synthetic and</text><text start="2329.02" dur="2.88">synthetic instruments it&apos;s just a matter</text><text start="2330.64" dur="4.5">of</text><text start="2331.9" dur="5.28">um clearly specifying all the risks and</text><text start="2335.14" dur="6.36">bounding them economically and</text><text start="2337.18" dur="6.72">enforceable by by the code</text><text start="2341.5" dur="5.22">um the fact that right now you can kind</text><text start="2343.9" dur="4.56">of move around assets and they can have</text><text start="2346.72" dur="3.899">lagging prices</text><text start="2348.46" dur="4.5">just opens up an enormous opportunity</text><text start="2350.619" dur="4.021">for all these Arbitrage type movements</text><text start="2352.96" dur="5.28">right so the the Alamedas of the world</text><text start="2354.64" dur="5.04">to move around uh billions from chain to</text><text start="2358.24" dur="5.04">chain to chain</text><text start="2359.68" dur="5.52">um the like relying on kind of uh takers</text><text start="2363.28" dur="3.78">being different and then making a ton of</text><text start="2365.2" dur="4.08">extracting a lot of value it&apos;s kind of a</text><text start="2367.06" dur="4.62">movie on steroids um you know cause the</text><text start="2369.28" dur="4.26">MAV problem uh but you know between</text><text start="2371.68" dur="4.02">chains and</text><text start="2373.54" dur="4.02">um that just shouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="2375.7" dur="3.659">doable like you should be you should</text><text start="2377.56" dur="3.299">have a much faster information flow</text><text start="2379.359" dur="5.161">between all the chains and you should be</text><text start="2380.859" dur="6.601">able to take much more calculated</text><text

this</text><text start="2390.16" dur="2.76">infrastructure is on the road maps not</text><text start="2391.66" dur="2.459">here yet</text><text start="2392.92" dur="4.199">um given that we only have 10 minutes</text><text start="2394.119" dur="5.401">left uh I&apos;d love to reorient the uh</text><text start="2397.119" dur="4.74">conversation around the reason why we&apos;re</text><text start="2399.52" dur="5.52">recording this episode which is how can</text><text start="2401.859" dur="4.801">we make crypto good for the world so uh</text><text start="2405.04" dur="3.299">you know I guess that&apos;s the question</text><text start="2406.66" dur="3.54">that I&apos;ll just re-ask as as we&apos;re</text><text start="2408.339" dur="3.421">starting to get into closing here what</text><text start="2410.2" dur="4.8">would have to be true for crypto to be</text><text start="2411.76" dur="5.099">unequivocally massively uh a positive</text><text start="2415.0" dur="4.44">influence on the world</text><text start="2416.859" dur="4.921">uh well I mean I already think it is uh</text><text start="2419.44" dur="5.399">and so like why what boxes have it has</text><text start="2421.78" dur="5.52">it checked that uh makes that true</text><text start="2424.839" dur="5.941">um I I think the answer is like straight</text><text start="2427.3" dur="5.279">up it puts more money and wealth into</text><text start="2430.78" dur="4.68">the hands of more people than it takes</text><text start="2432.579" dur="5.221">away uh and like that can&apos;t be true</text><text start="2435.46" dur="4.86">without crypto can&apos;t be adopted without</text><text start="2437.8" dur="3.96">that being true like if it&apos;s if it takes</text><text start="2440.32" dur="2.88">away money from you people are not going</text><text start="2441.76" dur="3.18">to go there if it gives you money people</text><text start="2443.2" dur="3.54">are gonna go there why do people come in</text><text start="2444.94" dur="3.96">to the top of the bull markets because</text><text start="2446.74" dur="5.16">it&apos;s crypto&apos;s putting more money in more</text><text start="2448.9" dur="4.14">people&apos;s hands uh and like then they</text><text start="2451.9" dur="2.459">leave during the bear markets because</text><text start="2453.04" dur="2.76">that stopped being true but some people</text><text start="2454.359" dur="3.121">stick around because they&apos;re like oh I</text><text start="2455.8" dur="3.42">think this still might give me money in</text><text start="2457.48" dur="4.8">the future uh and they stick around</text><text start="2459.22" dur="4.8">during the bear Market uh and it&apos;s like</text><text start="2462.28" dur="3.9">why is why is crypto being adopted in</text><text start="2464.02" dur="3.66">Argentina uh well because dye doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2466.18" dur="2.88">inflate at the same rate of the peso</text><text start="2467.68" dur="4.2">it&apos;s putting more money into more</text><text start="2469.06" dur="5.16">people&apos;s hands uh and so uh that&apos;s</text><text start="2471.88" dur="4.56">always been it&apos;s literally why we were</text><text start="2474.22" dur="4.68">here we&apos;re here it&apos;s it&apos;s kind of about</text><text start="2476.44" dur="4.02">the money money uh and like people that</text><text start="2478.9" dur="3.679">say it&apos;s about the technology well the</text><text start="2480.46" dur="4.379">technology is about the money</text><text start="2482.579" dur="4.061">uh and so I think it&apos;s just a simple</text><text start="2484.839" dur="3.301">function of like how it is just like</text><text start="2486.64" dur="3.479">sustainable wealth generation at the end</text><text start="2488.14" dur="4.62">of the day it&apos;s like crypto is this</text><text start="2490.119" dur="3.661">massive like uh oil well you know you</text><text start="2492.76" dur="2.52">know those oil wells that are like</text><text start="2493.78" dur="3.18">spitting out of the ground and like oh</text><text start="2495.28" dur="3.18">we&apos;re all like dancing around this oil I</text><text start="2496.96" dur="3.06">was like oh like wealth generation and</text><text start="2498.46" dur="4.32">now we need to figure out how to make</text><text start="2500.02" dur="4.14">that well never ever ever dry up uh and</text><text start="2502.78" dur="3.18">so like we already have this well</text><text start="2504.16" dur="3.84">spitting out a bunch of like resources</text><text start="2505.96" dur="4.44">that like is enough to sustain this</text><text start="2508.0" dur="6.48">industry at uh 800 billion dollar market</text><text start="2510.4" dur="6.3">cap uh how do we uh engineer using code</text><text start="2514.48" dur="3.96">to make sure that this well never dries</text><text start="2516.7" dur="4.32">up and it actually spews out more oil</text><text start="2518.44" dur="3.899">over time uh that&apos;s that&apos;s what we need</text><text start="2521.02" dur="3.12">to do</text><text start="2522.339" dur="4.981">one what do you think so same question</text><text start="2524.14" dur="5.04">to you a few things um just one on the</text><text start="2527.32" dur="2.94">on the Oil Well thing it&apos;s about</text><text start="2529.18" dur="3.54">uh</text><text start="2530.26" dur="4.44">generating that kind of utility it&apos;s</text><text start="2532.72" dur="4.26">like generating the oil type thing and</text><text start="2534.7" dur="4.86">it&apos;s not you know it&apos;s generating that</text><text start="2536.98" dur="5.76">set of Economic Opportunity</text><text start="2539.56" dur="4.38">um to coordinate us and to and to enable</text><text start="2542.74" dur="3.42">us to improve</text><text start="2543.94" dur="4.38">uh resource allocation</text><text start="2546.16" dur="6.06">um the what I think it needs to be true</text><text start="2548.32" dur="4.56">is first and foremost we need to have</text><text start="2552.22" dur="3.66">um</text><text start="2552.88" dur="4.739">broad digital infrastructure that</text><text start="2555.88" dur="3.78">can give us</text><text start="2557.619" dur="4.161">digital human rights and what that means</text><text start="2559.66" dur="4.62">is uh we need</text><text start="2561.78" dur="6.24">a credible</text><text start="2564.28" dur="8.339">Foundation like robust foundation for</text><text start="2568.02" dur="7.0">speech for transactions for messages for</text><text start="2572.619" dur="4.201">email for broad Communications between</text><text start="2575.02" dur="3.599">humans around the world</text><text start="2576.82" dur="3.18">um that is close like we&apos;re relatively</text><text start="2578.619" dur="3.301">close we&apos;re not quite there</text><text start="2580.0" dur="3.54">uh but I think once we achieve that</text><text start="2581.92" dur="4.5">Crypt is going to be not dramatically</text><text start="2583.54" dur="4.46">better position in having helped</text><text start="2586.42" dur="5.76">um billions of people around the planet</text><text start="2588.0" dur="6.46">uh the second is we need a</text><text start="2592.18" dur="4.2">we need the financial use cases to be</text><text start="2594.46" dur="5.1">less than 10 percent</text><text start="2596.38" dur="4.62">uh econ economy and economic use cases</text><text start="2599.56" dur="3.66">and financial use case are some somewhat</text><text start="2601.0" dur="2.94">different like individual</text><text start="2603.22" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="2603.94" dur="5.159">uh money and so on an individual private</text><text start="2606.64" dur="4.92">wealth is different from</text><text start="2609.099" dur="3.301">the broad economic</text><text start="2611.56" dur="2.82">um</text><text start="2612.4" dur="3.719">structures that coordinate us and so I</text><text start="2614.38" dur="3.239">think the economy is the world and</text><text start="2616.119" dur="4.561">finance as Wall Street</text><text start="2617.619" dur="5.341">exactly and so like let&apos;s make the Wall</text><text start="2620.68" dur="3.899">Street part of crypto tiny in comparison</text><text start="2622.96" dur="3.72">to the other stuff</text><text start="2624.579" dur="3.121">um you know less than 10 ideally</text><text start="2626.68" dur="2.159">um and I think right now I don&apos;t know</text><text start="2627.7" dur="3.96">what the percentage is but it&apos;s probably</text><text start="2628.839" dur="6.181">like closer to 50 or 60 maybe 70.</text><text start="2631.66" dur="4.86">um and so that needs to get uh much</text><text start="2635.02" dur="3.299">smaller</text><text start="2636.52" dur="4.92">um I mean yeah and that by market cap</text><text start="2638.319" dur="4.681">right probably not by um by maybe the</text><text start="2641.44" dur="3.48">allocation of people working so if you</text><text start="2643.0" dur="3.24">maybe track it by head count of who&apos;s</text><text start="2644.92" dur="3.72">working on what</text><text start="2646.24" dur="5.7">um that probably looks different but</text><text start="2648.64" dur="5.64">um the just the the market cap uh</text><text start="2651.94" dur="4.02">probably Stacks it that way and then I</text><text start="2654.28" dur="4.62">think uh one of the things we need to</text><text start="2655.96" dur="5.22">get to is just super user-friendly</text><text start="2658.9" dur="4.8">Primitives that can be deployed quickly</text><text start="2661.18" dur="4.38">right like uh Kevin like we could have</text><text start="2663.7" dur="4.1">we could have avoided This Disaster as a</text><text start="2665.56" dur="4.74">community we could have stepped in and</text><text start="2667.8" dur="5.08">averted the problem we just didn&apos;t have</text><text start="2670.3" dur="4.62">the the tools to do it fast enough uh we</text><text start="2672.88" dur="4.26">couldn&apos;t coordinate a massive response</text><text start="2674.92" dur="4.02">as a community and even ahead of that we</text><text start="2677.14" dur="3.36">couldn&apos;t coordinate the checks and</text><text start="2678.94" dur="3.12">balances on these institutions to make</text><text start="2680.5" dur="2.88">sure they&apos;re not drifting people and</text><text start="2682.06" dur="4.2">they&apos;re not violating their own rules</text><text start="2683.38" dur="6.84">yeah uh we couldn&apos;t could totally</text><text start="2686.26" dur="6.78">establish a a self-regulation type</text><text start="2690.22" dur="5.52">um labeling of exchanges and traditional</text><text start="2693.04" dur="6.36">institutions that tell us which ones are</text><text start="2695.74" dur="5.339">uh legit passing passing requirements</text><text start="2699.4" dur="4.199">um you know don&apos;t just count on</text><text start="2701.079" dur="4.201">exchanges out of the goodness of their</text><text start="2703.599" dur="4.02">heart imposing their own rules on</text><text start="2705.28" dur="4.74">themselves like uh you know proof of uh</text><text start="2707.619" dur="4.2">custody and like proof of um reserves</text><text start="2710.02" dur="3.299">and all that kind of stuff but just</text><text start="2711.819" dur="3.0">enforce it at a community-wide level</text><text start="2713.319" dur="3.721">like we don&apos;t need any government</text><text start="2714.819" dur="3.481">outside of the outside of crypto to tell</text><text start="2717.04" dur="3.36">us that</text><text start="2718.3" dur="4.26">um and then I think like we need to have</text><text start="2720.4" dur="4.32">a kpi around</text><text start="2722.56" dur="4.14">um being able to have</text><text start="2724.72" dur="3.42">people from around the world billions of</text><text start="2726.7" dur="2.34">people around the world being able to</text><text start="2728.14" dur="3.42">find</text><text start="2729.04" dur="3.84">jobs in crypto jobs to crypto so one of</text><text start="2731.56" dur="3.66">the things that I have always thought</text><text start="2732.88" dur="3.78">has been amazing about the crypto space</text><text start="2735.22" dur="3.0">is that you can be anywhere in the in</text><text start="2736.66" dur="4.74">the world and if you have connectivity</text><text start="2738.22" dur="5.94">to the internet you can find a way to</text><text start="2741.4" dur="5.1">trade your time for money in some in</text><text start="2744.16" dur="4.439">some way to buy food and shelter and so</text><text start="2746.5" dur="3.72">on and that has lifted</text><text start="2748.599" dur="2.76">thousands maybe tens of thousands of</text><text start="2750.22" dur="3.06">people hundreds of thousands of people</text><text start="2751.359" dur="3.361">out of poverty in the world like crypto</text><text start="2753.28" dur="3.6">has probably done that it probably</text><text start="2754.72" dur="3.78">hasn&apos;t lifted millions or tens of</text><text start="2756.88" dur="3.3">millions it&apos;s probably in the tens to</text><text start="2758.5" dur="3.839">hundreds of thousands</text><text start="2760.18" dur="5.46">um but if we can get that to say</text><text start="2762.339" dur="4.801">the crypto world employs</text><text start="2765.64" dur="3.24">more people are on the planet than</text><text start="2767.14" dur="3.959">almost any other industry where anybody</text><text start="2768.88" dur="4.08">whoever anywhere around the world can</text><text start="2771.099" dur="4.201">look at their own skill sets and find</text><text start="2772.96" dur="4.32">some project to work on some project to</text><text start="2775.3" dur="3.84">contribute to that is going to give them</text><text start="2777.28" dur="3.66">a better alternative than than local</text><text start="2779.14" dur="3.12">employment like that could be a</text><text start="2780.94" dur="3.179">phenomenal place to be in and that&apos;s I</text><text start="2782.26" dur="3.54">don&apos;t think that&apos;s far away from that I</text><text start="2784.119" dur="4.801">also think it&apos;s a huge opportunity of</text><text start="2785.8" dur="5.34">growth for web3 because for 97 of</text><text start="2788.92" dur="3.419">humanity their financial lives and by</text><text start="2791.14" dur="3.36">the way we&apos;re building the internet of</text><text start="2792.339" dur="3.841">Finance here their financial lives is</text><text start="2794.5" dur="4.8">their jobs and their communities not</text><text start="2796.18" dur="4.98">their their bags and their investment so</text><text start="2799.3" dur="4.019">if crypto wants to grow then I think the</text><text start="2801.16" dur="4.86">internet of jobs and web 3 jobs is is</text><text start="2803.319" dur="4.5">just kind of a necessity this necessity</text><text start="2806.02" dur="4.079">direction that it&apos;s going to go</text><text start="2807.819" dur="3.661">to add on to what one was saying the</text><text start="2810.099" dur="3.361">first thing uh one was saying about how</text><text start="2811.48" dur="4.56">like we need to reduce the financial uh</text><text start="2813.46" dur="4.859">parts of crypto to like less than 10</text><text start="2816.04" dur="3.96">um it makes sense like if you go through</text><text start="2818.319" dur="3.961">the trajectory of crypto like first we</text><text start="2820.0" dur="3.839">made Bitcoin so that&apos;s money uh the next</text><text start="2822.28" dur="5.1">big thing that we made was ethereum</text><text start="2823.839" dur="5.76">which is like Finance smart contracts uh</text><text start="2827.38" dur="5.1">and ethereum has largely actually kind</text><text start="2829.599" dur="5.401">of just become one big exchange like if</text><text start="2832.48" dur="4.02">you go to uh ultrasound.money and you</text><text start="2835.0" dur="4.2">look at which applications are burning</text><text start="2836.5" dur="6.3">uh the most ether it&apos;s unit Swap and</text><text start="2839.2" dur="5.52">open C like the marketplaces the bazaars</text><text start="2842.8" dur="3.48">um uh and so well that just makes sense</text><text start="2844.72" dur="3.42">right from Genesis like first we make</text><text start="2846.28" dur="4.14">money then we make Finance uh then we</text><text start="2848.14" dur="4.8">make the stock exchanges like that seems</text><text start="2850.42" dur="6.06">like a logical order of operations</text><text start="2852.94" dur="5.28">um now uh we need to put more things on</text><text start="2856.48" dur="3.72">the stock exchange instead of instead of</text><text start="2858.22" dur="4.619">making more money markets or like</text><text start="2860.2" dur="5.76">Leverage stock exchanges or uh like</text><text start="2862.839" dur="5.52">whatever uh we need to make more tokens</text><text start="2865.96" dur="3.96">that go on those things right right and</text><text start="2868.359" dur="3.72">that&apos;s like that&apos;s the economy side of</text><text start="2869.92" dur="3.78">things that&apos;s the culture side of things</text><text start="2872.079" dur="4.621">um and like so bankless for example</text><text start="2873.7" dur="5.46">we&apos;re making an nft uh project uh it&apos;s</text><text start="2876.7" dur="4.5">one secret uh and this can be like your</text><text

all these extra cool</text><text start="2884.319" dur="3.78">things that will pile on to this token</text><text start="2886.0" dur="4.14">and people are gonna want it because of</text><text start="2888.099" dur="3.841">the things that it does for the owner uh</text><text start="2890.14" dur="5.28">and that&apos;s like that&apos;s Commerce that&apos;s</text><text start="2891.94" dur="5.28">economy not Finance uh and so I I really</text><text start="2895.42" dur="3.899">like that and so like you know we have</text><text start="2897.22" dur="3.42">the stock exchange of this Bazaar where</text><text start="2899.319" dur="3.601">a lot of people go and they trade their</text><text start="2900.64" dur="5.04">goods uh and I think watch is saying</text><text start="2902.92" dur="6.96">like well we need we need like uh</text><text start="2905.68" dur="5.939">neighborhoods and houses and avenues and</text><text start="2909.88" dur="3.6">and business doors for those people to</text><text start="2911.619" dur="3.781">go to and so like sweet we have Wall</text><text start="2913.48" dur="5.52">Street and now we need like the rest of</text><text start="2915.4" dur="5.1">Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens and</text><text start="2919.0" dur="2.339">Staten Island and all these other you</text><text start="2920.5" dur="1.98">know and then and then all of a sudden</text><text start="2921.339" dur="2.401">we have the world</text><text start="2922.48" dur="2.94">um I think that&apos;s that&apos;s probably what</text><text start="2923.74" dur="4.619">we need we need we need more nouns in</text><text start="2925.42" dur="4.939">the crypto space yeah I think uh what I</text><text start="2928.359" dur="5.521">would do is I would look at the</text><text start="2930.359" dur="6.641">most used applications on the internet</text><text start="2933.88" dur="5.76">so either websites or mobile apps and</text><text start="2937.0" dur="6.599">then sort them by how easy is it to</text><text start="2939.64" dur="5.459">build them in in with crypto in web3 and</text><text start="2943.599" dur="2.701">um then just sort of get started and</text><text start="2945.099" dur="3.181">there are some that are just you can&apos;t</text><text start="2946.3" dur="4.5">do today so you know you can&apos;t do</text><text start="2948.28" dur="4.14">Twitter on web3 yet there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2950.8" dur="3.18">work that needs to happen in order to</text><text start="2952.42" dur="3.899">scale to that you know I would guess</text><text start="2953.98" dur="3.72">that&apos;s two to three years out but it&apos;s</text><text start="2956.319" dur="4.381">not 10 years out</text><text start="2957.7" dur="3.6">um and but can you do</text><text start="2960.7" dur="4.44">um</text><text start="2961.3" dur="6.24">can you make a a much Sounder uh real</text><text start="2965.14" dur="4.02">estate market uh that that might be kind</text><text start="2967.54" dur="3.36">of again close too close to finance</text><text start="2969.16" dur="3.54">maybe uh but that&apos;s potentially</text><text start="2970.9" dur="3.959">something I can leverage all of the all</text><text start="2972.7" dur="3.18">of the structures today uh to help a lot</text><text start="2974.859" dur="3.601">of the world especially those those</text><text start="2975.88" dur="3.84">countries that don&apos;t have good Financial</text><text start="2978.46" dur="2.879">Stacks</text><text start="2979.72" dur="4.74">um but then you know go beyond that and</text><text start="2981.339" dur="4.621">go into you know what you know whenever</text><text start="2984.46" dur="3.42">I hear people talking about weather</text><text start="2985.96" dur="3.42">games and so on it is always overly</text><text start="2987.88" dur="3.66">financialized like it&apos;s like that&apos;s not</text><text start="2989.38" dur="6.6">the point it&apos;s like hey can we can we go</text><text start="2991.54" dur="7.02">and make the communities and</text><text start="2995.98" dur="5.099">um digital worlds that we love playing</text><text start="2998.56" dur="5.759">and engaging in and we can we make those</text><text start="3001.079" dur="5.881">that activity have regenerative economic</text><text start="3004.319" dur="5.641">Loops in there uh like that that&apos;s a</text><text start="3006.96" dur="5.28">very different kind of orientation</text><text start="3009.96" dur="4.5">um and so can hey when is what we&apos;re</text><text start="3012.24" dur="5.579">going to be ready for for that kind of</text><text start="3014.46" dur="5.399">um that kind of environment</text><text start="3017.819" dur="4.081">um</text><text start="3019.859" dur="4.98">and yeah look I think I think maybe one</text><text start="3021.9" dur="6.0">what crypto needs to get better is</text><text start="3024.839" dur="5.101">both a an impact compass and a moral</text><text start="3027.9" dur="3.9">compass and if we can make that into</text><text start="3029.94" dur="3.54">websites where you can always go into</text><text start="3031.8" dur="5.1">like you know how how good is scripture</text><text start="3033.48" dur="5.099">for the world dot IO or whatever and you</text><text start="3036.9" dur="2.88">can see the kpis you can see how many</text><text start="3038.579" dur="4.74">people</text><text start="3039.78" dur="4.86">um are now we talked about background</text><text start="3043.319" dur="3.54">Bank well how many people are there</text><text start="3044.64" dur="4.62">really like there are probably hundreds</text><text start="3046.859" dur="5.041">of thousands of millions but not 100</text><text start="3049.26" dur="4.62">million one what I worry about with that</text><text start="3051.9" dur="4.26">is that people hear that and they just</text><text start="3053.88" dur="3.959">hear ESG and I think that the ESG</text><text start="3056.16" dur="3.54">ratings</text><text start="3057.839" dur="4.26">have a lot of problems with them that</text><text start="3059.7" dur="3.54">people in crypto have pointed out and</text><text start="3062.099" dur="2.581">you know if there&apos;s gonna be impact</text><text start="3063.24" dur="3.3">ratings in web 3 they have to be</text><text start="3064.68" dur="4.62">decentralized they can&apos;t be capturable</text><text start="3066.54" dur="5.819">they need to actually inform where money</text><text start="3069.3" dur="5.7">and capital rotate into in like a way</text><text start="3072.359" dur="4.26">that has teeth as opposed to I mean I</text><text start="3075.0" dur="3.72">mean I just think that like</text><text start="3076.619" dur="4.801">the ESG thing I I don&apos;t think that</text><text start="3078.72" dur="4.02">Reinventing ESG on web3 is is a good</text><text start="3081.42" dur="2.639">direction I know you&apos;re not saying that</text><text start="3082.74" dur="2.879">but I just want to say that out loud to</text><text start="3084.059" dur="2.76">the listeners here that we&apos;re talking</text><text start="3085.619" dur="6.601">about something fundamentally</text><text start="3086.819" dur="7.201">decentralized uncapturable and uh in a</text><text start="3092.22" dur="3.48">fundamentally new structure that helps</text><text start="3094.02" dur="3.66">rotate capital and talent towards things</text><text start="3095.7" dur="3.419">that are actually good for people and</text><text start="3097.68" dur="3.179">good for the world and and maybe the</text><text start="3099.119" dur="3.48">inverse of of impact ratings for</text><text start="3100.859" dur="3.541">positive stuff is impact rating for</text><text start="3102.599" dur="3.541">negative things like developing an</text><text start="3104.4" dur="5.459">immune system so that we spot the next</text><text start="3106.14" dur="5.58">three AC or the next uh SBF early and</text><text start="3109.859" dur="4.021">almost like a prediction Market where</text><text start="3111.72" dur="3.42">people can be rewarded for for routing</text><text start="3113.88" dur="2.4">those out I think would be the inverse</text><text start="3115.14" dur="3.24">of that and that would be massively</text><text start="3116.28" dur="5.279">useful to the space</text><text start="3118.38" dur="5.219">I think it&apos;s also worth noting uh that</text><text start="3121.559" dur="3.361">uh if something like FTX if we&apos;re</text><text start="3123.599" dur="4.381">worried about like hey let&apos;s make sure</text><text start="3124.92" dur="4.62">we don&apos;t get ftxed again uh maybe people</text><text start="3127.98" dur="4.5">should you know take custody of their</text><text start="3129.54" dur="4.62">own assets uh and not do that and like</text><text start="3132.48" dur="3.359">use web three in the way that&apos;s meant to</text><text start="3134.16" dur="3.6">be used if we want that world which we</text><text start="3135.839" dur="4.141">do uh account abstraction like has to be</text><text start="3137.76" dur="4.44">mentioned uh like there&apos;s there&apos;s no way</text><text start="3139.98" dur="4.74">that we we on board the world without</text><text start="3142.2" dur="4.98">account abstraction uh and so I think if</text><text start="3144.72" dur="3.839">this is just like a uh something to be</text><text start="3147.18" dur="3.48">learned about anything or about where to</text><text start="3148.559" dur="3.661">redirect resources uh as a result of</text><text start="3150.66" dur="3.48">this is probably we should make account</text><text start="3152.22" dur="5.22">extraction happen faster</text><text start="3154.14" dur="5.52">yeah and much you know we need I really</text><text start="3157.44" dur="4.26">like Ledger it&apos;d be great to have</text><text start="3159.66" dur="4.56">many devices that are extremely good</text><text start="3161.7" dur="4.379">like that like like why is there only</text><text start="3164.22" dur="3.42">like two or three that are recently good</text><text start="3166.079" dur="4.441">and even those are still pretty hard to</text><text start="3167.64" dur="4.38">use uh and yeah like the kind of</text><text start="3170.52" dur="2.64">abstraction stuff to be able to get you</text><text start="3172.02" dur="3.24">know social recovery and all that kind</text><text start="3173.16" dur="3.48">of stuff is really key um honestly</text><text start="3175.26" dur="2.7">Ledger should really take a leadership</text><text start="3176.64" dur="2.88">position with account abstraction</text><text start="3177.96" dur="3.06">because like they&apos;re going to need to</text><text start="3179.52" dur="4.319">Pivot their business model as soon as</text><text start="3181.02" dur="6.78">account abstraction is like uh the new</text><text start="3183.839" dur="5.76">standard new status quo so maybe this is</text><text start="3187.8" dur="3.18">like a call on Ledger like yo like you</text><text start="3189.599" dur="2.881">guys make account abstraction happen</text><text start="3190.98" dur="3.72">because it&apos;s going to be super relevant</text><text start="3192.48" dur="5.76">for your business model I think one one</text><text start="3194.7" dur="6.3">last thing I would love to mention is um</text><text start="3198.24" dur="4.56">like this this road is pretty long it&apos;s</text><text start="3201.0" dur="3.9">pretty hard a lot of us have been</text><text start="3202.8" dur="3.72">working on this for many it&apos;s gonna be</text><text start="3204.9" dur="4.439">like 10 years for me I guess this year</text><text start="3206.52" dur="4.26">is like yeah nine to ten years uh and</text><text start="3209.339" dur="4.441">we&apos;ve made an enormous amount of</text><text start="3210.78" dur="6.0">progress in a lot of fronts uh I think a</text><text start="3213.78" dur="4.2">lot of us feel that the world is or is</text><text start="3216.78" dur="3.66">magnitude better than it used to be</text><text start="3217.98" dur="4.98">because of some components but it&apos;s Pro</text><text start="3220.44" dur="4.44">but we all probably feel it&apos;s going too</text><text start="3222.96" dur="3.96">slowly when we look at the social</text><text start="3224.88" dur="4.32">networks and other movements of the</text><text start="3226.92" dur="3.659">internet they&apos;ve moved faster and so the</text><text start="3229.2" dur="3.419">the big thing that we need to do and</text><text start="3230.579" dur="4.621">coordinate around is understand what&apos;s</text><text start="3232.619" dur="5.281">holding us back what&apos;s preventing that</text><text start="3235.2" dur="5.58">kind of faster exponential Improvement</text><text start="3237.9" dur="5.1">and get ourselves on a train to</text><text start="3240.78" dur="4.86">to finish that this work faster because</text><text start="3243.0" dur="4.559">we cannot take another 15 years to to</text><text start="3245.64" dur="4.14">get to that success we need to achieve a</text><text start="3247.559" dur="3.961">lot of these things in in five</text><text start="3249.78" dur="4.799">um five to ten and and I think like</text><text start="3251.52" dur="4.74">that&apos;s you know um</text><text start="3254.579" dur="2.52">there&apos;s a whole other you know</text><text start="3256.26" dur="2.819">um</text><text start="3257.099" dur="4.081">reason to</text><text start="3259.079" dur="3.121">to bet on crypto and and bet on these</text><text start="3261.18" dur="3.179">things around</text><text start="3262.2" dur="3.48">uh it was kind of like describe it here</text><text start="3264.359" dur="2.401">briefly</text><text start="3265.68" dur="4.8">um there&apos;s a very strong possibility</text><text start="3266.76" dur="5.94">that the traditional Financial system is</text><text start="3270.48" dur="4.68">going to get something similar to crypto</text><text start="3272.7" dur="5.82">rails like all the cbdcs and so on and</text><text start="3275.16" dur="5.34">it&apos;s going to lead to some of the</text><text start="3278.52" dur="3.78">strongest orwellian States ever</text><text start="3280.5" dur="4.02">imaginable because they&apos;re going to</text><text start="3282.3" dur="3.779">create a structure where</text><text start="3284.52" dur="4.14">um you know even computers are fast</text><text start="3286.079" dur="5.341">enough that you could literally have</text><text start="3288.66" dur="5.939">before any transaction happens a query</text><text start="3291.42" dur="5.34">going to a centralized database asking</text><text start="3294.599" dur="5.101">should you Kevin should you David right</text><text start="3296.76" dur="5.88">now be allowed to buy this this glass of</text><text start="3299.7" dur="4.859">water or like this this uh this gas for</text><text start="3302.64" dur="5.699">your car or this</text><text start="3304.559" dur="5.941">um this card in the first place and that</text><text start="3308.339" dur="3.121">future could be really dark around the</text><text start="3310.5" dur="2.22">world</text><text start="3311.46" dur="3.84">um we&apos;re starting to see it with the</text><text start="3312.72" dur="4.68">Chinese credit system and the prevention</text><text start="3315.3" dur="4.62">of access to infrastructure and</text><text start="3317.4" dur="3.9">prevention of access to travel and and</text><text start="3319.92" dur="5.48">other things</text><text start="3321.3" dur="7.799">um cbdc&apos;s and uh the kind of</text><text start="3325.4" dur="5.5">super powerful centralized Financial</text><text start="3329.099" dur="3.901">control that&apos;s going to be possible</text><text start="3330.9" dur="4.98">thanks to them</text><text start="3333.0" dur="4.92">um from like enable this kind of very</text><text start="3335.88" dur="5.1">dark potential feature and so there&apos;s a</text><text start="3337.92" dur="5.699">a really big thing that</text><text start="3340.98" dur="3.78">crypto is a massive Shield against all</text><text start="3343.619" dur="3.061">of that like if you go back to this</text><text start="3344.76" dur="4.859">afterpunk mailing list and what where it</text><text start="3346.68" dur="4.679">all started uh cryptography in crypto</text><text start="3349.619" dur="4.801">economics it&apos;s a massive Shield against</text><text start="3351.359" dur="5.101">that kind of abuse and</text><text start="3354.42" dur="4.32">in if if we&apos;re really serious about that</text><text start="3356.46" dur="3.899">and we&apos;re gonna complete that work it</text><text start="3358.74" dur="3.3">needs to happen sooner</text><text start="3360.359" dur="3.72">um because these large scale systems are</text><text start="3362.04" dur="5.279">gonna are starting to get deployed</text><text start="3364.079" dur="5.04">um and so the the I I want to kind of</text><text start="3367.319" dur="5.101">like have a really strong call to action</text><text start="3369.119" dur="5.401">in our community to clean up our act to</text><text start="3372.42" dur="4.5">have way higher standards for ourselves</text><text start="3374.52" dur="3.839">than than traditional World</text><text start="3376.92" dur="3.179">um to really focus on the non-financial</text><text start="3378.359" dur="3.541">use cases does that allow for the long</text><text start="3380.099" dur="4.321">term because it&apos;s you know it&apos;s been 10</text><text start="3381.9" dur="3.24">years it&apos;s going to be a while longer</text><text start="3384.42" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="3385.14" dur="4.08">but really make strong
