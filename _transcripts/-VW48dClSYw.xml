wrote</text><text start="205.98" dur="4.56">the Tara Puck Manifesto after reading</text><text start="208.56" dur="3.599">about solar Punk and just being kind of</text><text start="210.54" dur="4.5">dissatisfied with some of the answers</text><text start="212.159" dur="5.881">that it provides uh for the future</text><text start="215.04" dur="4.5">um the terrapunk manifesto kind of I see</text><text start="218.04" dur="3.54">it as a step</text><text start="219.54" dur="3.24">um there used to be steampunk and not</text><text start="221.58" dur="2.46">and then there was cyberpunk and then</text><text start="222.78" dur="3.9">there were solar Punk and I kind of see</text><text start="224.04" dur="4.619">it now as there&apos;s Tara Punk uh so the</text><text start="226.68" dur="3.18">terrapunk manifesto kind of contrasts</text><text start="228.659" dur="3.181">against silver Punk a little bit</text><text start="229.86" dur="4.2">although I think solar Punk is useful in</text><text start="231.84" dur="5.52">some cases but it kind of goes beyond uh</text><text start="234.06" dur="5.64">solar Punk and terrapunk is terraforming</text><text start="237.36" dur="4.799">Punk so it&apos;s about creating new worlds</text><text start="239.7" dur="3.539">and expanding Consciousness and creating</text><text start="242.159" dur="3.061">more land</text><text start="243.239" dur="4.021">um well yeah I mean I&apos;d love to to talk</text><text start="245.22" dur="3.78">about how you would Define steampunk and</text><text start="247.26" dur="4.38">solar Punk and use that as a base to</text><text start="249.0" dur="6.36">talk about how Tara Punk Builds on those</text><text start="251.64" dur="6.3">ideas yeah I mean steampunk is</text><text start="255.36" dur="4.559">um steampunk is like you know it&apos;s kind</text><text start="257.94" dur="3.66">of like kitschy technology</text><text start="259.919" dur="3.84">um it has these pistols and everything</text><text start="261.6" dur="3.72">uh it&apos;s it&apos;s to me it&apos;s kind of it&apos;s</text><text start="263.759" dur="3.961">kind of fun and it&apos;s kind of a little</text><text start="265.32" dur="5.099">bit retro uh in a way and it kind of</text><text start="267.72" dur="6.0">goes back in a nostalgic sense cyberpunk</text><text start="270.419" dur="6.06">is like futurism dystopia uh solar Punk</text><text start="273.72" dur="6.72">is you know kind of contrasting against</text><text start="276.479" dur="7.741">cyberpunk and it is trying to be more</text><text start="280.44" dur="5.819">pleasant and enticing and like uh I you</text><text start="284.22" dur="4.14">know it&apos;s more green uh whereas</text><text start="286.259" dur="3.781">cyberpunk really has any green unless</text><text start="288.36" dur="3.96">it&apos;s you know one piece of green</text><text start="290.04" dur="3.96">compared to like uh the entire dystopian</text><text start="292.32" dur="3.84">piece and it&apos;s like a dying treat or</text><text start="294.0" dur="3.66">something uh so solar Punk is like the</text><text start="296.16" dur="3.479">complete opposite of that has a ton of</text><text start="297.66" dur="5.099">trees and this is more in the aesthetic</text><text start="299.639" dur="6.181">sense uh than like what the ideological</text><text start="302.759" dur="5.88">suspense is trying to say um but yeah</text><text start="305.82" dur="5.04">solar Punk is is a is a is a lot</text><text start="308.639" dur="4.741">Greenery and trying to create life</text><text start="310.86" dur="3.839">um but I think that you know as I get</text><text start="313.38" dur="4.14">into in the essay I think there&apos;s some</text><text start="314.699" dur="5.641">flaws with like uh that sense yeah yeah</text><text start="317.52" dur="4.739">I mean I guess like my definitions just</text><text start="320.34" dur="4.62">to put them in the pot into stir Stir It</text><text start="322.259" dur="6.301">is that uh steampunk is a genre science</text><text start="324.96" dur="5.76">fiction that uh has a historical setting</text><text start="328.56" dur="4.32">and features steam-powered Machinery</text><text start="330.72" dur="3.479">rather than advanced technology it&apos;s</text><text start="332.88" dur="3.18">always to me been sort of like an</text><text start="334.199" dur="4.381">artistic aesthetic</text><text start="336.06" dur="4.979">um Cipher Punk uh some of the art is</text><text start="338.58" dur="4.26">very dystopian and futuristic but The</text><text start="341.039" dur="5.461">Cypher Punk Manifesto actually goes into</text><text start="342.84" dur="5.04">the values of privacy and sovereignty as</text><text start="346.5" dur="3.66">sort of like core principles for</text><text start="347.88" dur="5.879">organizing of human societies and then</text><text start="350.16" dur="6.78">solar punk as an art aesthetic has been</text><text start="353.759" dur="5.341">around like high Utopia High nature</text><text start="356.94" dur="4.86">scenes in which humanity is integrated</text><text start="359.1" dur="3.9">with the environment but uh you know</text><text start="361.8" dur="2.58">when you actually read a solar Punk</text><text start="363.0" dur="3.12">Manifesto there&apos;s people who are trying</text><text start="364.38" dur="4.259">to interpret the art and derive values</text><text start="366.12" dur="3.66">from that and they talk about a world in</text><text start="368.639" dur="3.9">which we&apos;ve solved our contemporary</text><text start="369.78" dur="4.62">problems with sustainability from there</text><text start="372.539" dur="3.541">so I guess like you know as we try to</text><text start="374.4" dur="3.42">pin these Downs it seems like depending</text><text start="376.08" dur="4.08">on the vantage point you look at there&apos;s</text><text start="377.82" dur="5.219">different definitions of these art</text><text start="380.16" dur="4.62">movements uh there&apos;s not like one</text><text start="383.039" dur="3.241">Central Authority that&apos;s kind of saying</text><text start="384.78" dur="2.94">what the values in the Aesthetics of</text><text start="386.28" dur="4.56">these are it&apos;s all kind of an</text><text start="387.72" dur="4.5">interpretive movement given by people on</text><text start="390.84" dur="3.66">the internet I&apos;m curious if you would</text><text start="392.22" dur="4.5">agree with that or or disagree as we&apos;re</text><text start="394.5" dur="5.22">building a foundation of shared</text><text start="396.72" dur="4.56">knowledge yeah and um yeah yeah no I</text><text start="399.72" dur="4.319">agree with that I would also just say</text><text start="401.28" dur="5.1">that uh in the essay I do call it uh</text><text start="404.039" dur="3.72">cyberpunk instead of cypherpunk and I do</text><text start="406.38" dur="3.36">think those are two different uh</text><text start="407.759" dur="3.72">movements I&apos;m more familiar with the</text><text start="409.74" dur="4.86">cyberpunk movement</text><text start="411.479" dur="4.44">um but also yeah like you were saying</text><text start="414.6" dur="2.76">it&apos;s kind of they&apos;re all kind of</text><text start="415.919" dur="4.861">decentralized and a bunch of people</text><text start="417.36" dur="5.339">talking about these movements and and uh</text><text start="420.78" dur="3.12">connecting with them I would I would</text><text start="422.699" dur="5.22">just like to say like I don&apos;t</text><text start="423.9" dur="5.94">necessarily plan to be the front face of</text><text start="427.919" dur="3.361">Tara Punk or like the the leader of</text><text start="429.84" dur="3.6">terrapunk I just wanted to put out a</text><text start="431.28" dur="3.479">Manifesto out there uh kind of just</text><text start="433.44" dur="3.24">talking about these ideas and hopefully</text><text start="434.759" dur="3.961">uh people kind of take them and run with</text><text start="436.68" dur="3.66">them and like you know on the Tara Punk</text><text start="438.72" dur="4.199">Twitter account I could like retweet art</text><text start="440.34" dur="4.979">or something if if people start creating</text><text start="442.919" dur="4.921">got it and that that Twitter account is</text><text start="445.319" dur="4.141">twitter.com terapunk is that right yeah</text><text start="447.84" dur="4.38">yeah cool we&apos;ll make sure that gets into</text><text start="449.46" dur="5.34">the show notes okay two hours uh by the</text><text start="452.22" dur="4.56">way because there&apos;s the you know Balaji</text><text start="454.8" dur="3.42">he quote tweeted the original tweet and</text><text start="456.78" dur="4.8">he was saying that should be Tara Punk</text><text start="458.22" dur="5.58">uh t-e-r-a which is energy levels so it</text><text start="461.58" dur="3.54">was like Giga Terra uh kind of on the</text><text start="463.8" dur="3.959">energy scales</text><text start="465.12" dur="4.799">um whereas Tara with two r&apos;s is uh</text><text start="467.759" dur="4.621">terraforming so it&apos;s it&apos;s creating more</text><text start="469.919" dur="4.861">Earth and I think you know in this</text><text start="472.38" dur="4.8">scenario we might go beyond uh the Terra</text><text start="474.78" dur="6.539">energy scale mm-hmm</text><text start="477.18" dur="5.1">got it so so I mean I guess like now</text><text start="481.319" dur="3.361">that we&apos;ve built that that that</text><text start="482.28" dur="4.74">Foundation of shared knowledge</text><text start="484.68" dur="4.5">um it seems like to me terrapunk and its</text><text start="487.02" dur="4.079">most reductionist form is it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="489.18" dur="3.6">like a fork of solar Punk that&apos;s</text><text start="491.099" dur="3.481">designed to be more High human we&apos;ve got</text><text start="492.78" dur="4.02">into our political economies baked into</text><text start="494.58" dur="3.42">the idea uh baked into our political</text><text start="496.8" dur="4.079">economies is the idea of like two</text><text start="498.0" dur="4.379">percent growth year over year and you</text><text start="500.879" dur="3.781">know if we&apos;re gonna solve our</text><text start="502.379" dur="4.921">sustainability problems but also solve</text><text start="504.66" dur="5.64">uh the ability for our economy to still</text><text start="507.3" dur="4.5">support people then solar Punk doesn&apos;t</text><text start="510.3" dur="3.06">seem to actually have a lot of humans in</text><text start="511.8" dur="4.14">it like we can&apos;t just go back to this</text><text start="513.36" dur="5.16">this perfect uh Immaculate Earth that</text><text start="515.94" dur="4.38">existed 3000 or however many years ago</text><text start="518.52" dur="4.56">we need to create a civilization we</text><text start="520.32" dur="4.86">can&apos;t go back to Genesis yeah exactly so</text><text start="523.08" dur="3.48">Tara Punk is is kind of</text><text start="525.18" dur="3.659">um talking about what it means to have</text><text start="526.56" dur="4.44">expansion and also sustainability is</text><text start="528.839" dur="3.661">that true reductive reductionist and and</text><text start="531.0" dur="3.899">how would you how would you change that</text><text start="532.5" dur="3.959">no no that&apos;s exactly it because I do</text><text start="534.899" dur="3.721">think that solar Punk wants to go back</text><text start="536.459" dur="4.32">to Genesis it wants to go back to kind</text><text start="538.62" dur="4.14">of the commune and like everybody&apos;s uh</text><text start="540.779" dur="4.081">reducing themselves or just doesn&apos;t have</text><text start="542.76" dur="4.62">too much like output uh in terms of</text><text start="544.86" dur="6.72">carbon footprint and so that that kind</text><text start="547.38" dur="6.78">of ends up uh minimizing Humanity in in</text><text start="551.58" dur="5.1">one of two ways it&apos;s either you minimize</text><text start="554.16" dur="4.739">the space that each human gets so it&apos;s</text><text start="556.68" dur="4.68">human atomization and that means like we</text><text start="558.899" dur="4.141">all maybe we eventually have an earth uh</text><text start="561.36" dur="4.14">full of just like apartment buildings</text><text start="563.04" dur="3.479">and everybody gets like almost no space</text><text start="565.5" dur="4.26">um but we&apos;re trying to have as many</text><text start="566.519" dur="4.561">humans as as we can or it turns into uh</text><text start="569.76" dur="3.84">you know people still want their space</text><text start="571.08" dur="4.14">but uh you can&apos;t have too many humans</text><text start="573.6" dur="3.239">with carbon Footprints so it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="575.22" dur="3.96">human minimization</text><text start="576.839" dur="4.381">uh so so you just can&apos;t have that many</text><text start="579.18" dur="3.599">human nobody repopulates this is what</text><text start="581.22" dur="2.64">we&apos;re seeing with the repopulation</text><text start="582.779" dur="3.12">crisis</text><text start="583.86" dur="4.62">um with birth controls plummeting this</text><text start="585.899" dur="5.521">is kind of that ideology it&apos;s reducing</text><text start="588.48" dur="6.12">humanity and human uh the

start="675.12" dur="3.839">like it you know if we&apos;re gonna solve</text><text start="676.98" dur="3.78">our sustainability problems but also</text><text start="678.959" dur="4.38">continue

that</text><text start="710.279" dur="4.5">um you know I think Tara punk you know</text><text start="712.2" dur="4.98">maybe we could uh bring resources from</text><text start="714.779" dur="4.261">the stars back to Earth uh maybe we</text><text start="717.18" dur="3.659">create O&apos;Neill cylinders with more</text><text start="719.04" dur="4.14">Earths maybe it maybe we have to go out</text><text start="720.839" dur="5.161">maybe we just um</text><text start="723.18" dur="4.74">like for example solar Punk uh as the</text><text start="726.0" dur="3.36">name implies you know even if even if</text><text start="727.92" dur="3.72">you want to get away from it but like a</text><text start="729.36" dur="4.68">lot of people on Reddit and I I tried</text><text start="731.64" dur="4.02">confirming this just uh but like a lot</text><text start="734.04" dur="4.02">of people on Reddit uh are against</text><text start="735.66" dur="4.08">nuclear for example but nuclear is one</text><text start="738.06" dur="4.08">of those technologies that compresses</text><text start="739.74" dur="3.3">like the energy output uh with like its</text><text start="742.14" dur="2.879">footprint</text><text start="743.04" dur="3.299">um compared to solar panels instead of</text><text start="745.019" dur="3.301">like so we don&apos;t have to blanket</text><text start="746.339" dur="5.521">mountains with solar panels</text><text start="748.32" dur="5.519">um I I do think that the idea of</text><text start="751.86" dur="3.36">terrapunk and having uh you know</text><text start="753.839" dur="4.5">billions and billions or trillions of</text><text start="755.22" dur="5.52">humans uh does necessitate necessitate</text><text start="758.339" dur="4.68">going out into the stars</text><text start="760.74" dur="4.56">um I don&apos;t I don&apos;t think that Tara Punk</text><text start="763.019" dur="4.021">is compatible with just like

start="770.579" dur="4.2">think it does go out into the Stars</text><text start="773.16" dur="3.72">there&apos;s some really great visuals on the</text><text start="774.779" dur="3.901">Tara Puck Manifesto which by the way</text><text start="776.88" dur="3.78">will be in the show notes of this</text><text start="778.68" dur="4.5">podcast episode that kind of have a Venn</text><text start="780.66" dur="5.46">diagram that compares solar Punk and</text><text start="783.18" dur="5.399">terrapunk so um some of the the memes</text><text start="786.12" dur="5.1">that I see in in terrapunk is pro</text><text start="788.579" dur="4.621">markets pro-nucular prodison spheres</text><text start="791.22" dur="4.619">pro-genetic engineering expanding life</text><text start="793.2" dur="4.28">throughout the Universe</text><text start="795.839" dur="5.161">um increasing population</text><text start="797.48" dur="5.02">and and in the center between solar Punk</text><text start="801.0" dur="3.72">and terrapunk we have green architecture</text><text start="802.5" dur="5.1">and trees we&apos;re anti-climate change and</text><text start="804.72" dur="5.28">we&apos;re Pro-Tech and and have that in in</text><text start="807.6" dur="5.94">solar panels in common with solar Punk</text><text start="810.0" dur="5.94">but but you know I want to drive in on</text><text start="813.54" dur="4.859">the the part of this Venn diagram that</text><text start="815.94" dur="6.72">talks about solar punk in which you say</text><text start="818.399" dur="6.781">that um solar Punk is anti-markets and</text><text start="822.66" dur="4.56">um humans are subservient to Nature and</text><text start="825.18" dur="4.44">the collective is greater than the</text><text start="827.22" dur="4.679">individual so so the individual&apos;s rights</text><text start="829.62" dur="3.56">are subservient to the collective</text><text start="831.899" dur="3.901">um do you think that that&apos;s your</text><text start="833.18" dur="4.719">interpretation of solar Punk does the</text><text start="835.8" dur="4.62">art aesthetic actually confer those</text><text start="837.899" dur="5.641">things and in what ways do you think</text><text start="840.42" dur="6.06">that solar Punk is is missing the mark</text><text start="843.54" dur="5.099">so yeah so I tried uh because I know</text><text start="846.48" dur="4.979">this would it would be like uh</text><text start="848.639" dur="4.861">subversive or controversial uh to kind</text><text start="851.459" dur="4.741">of like you know nag solar Punk like</text><text start="853.5" dur="4.26">this uh I did like I spent a lot of time</text><text start="856.2" dur="3.48">reading the Reddit and uh the original</text><text start="857.76" dur="4.74">papers and a lot of people talking about</text><text start="859.68" dur="5.58">it and they were often like saying that</text><text start="862.5" dur="5.339">you know capitalism is what destroyed uh</text><text start="865.26" dur="6.42">the environment uh which you know we</text><text start="867.839" dur="6.861">could get into the you know uh but like</text><text start="871.68" dur="5.52">um and it was very anti-capitalism</text><text start="874.7" dur="4.72">anti-market and it was more like uh you</text><text start="877.2" dur="3.86">know reduce yourself uh to like kind of</text><text start="879.42" dur="5.039">save the Earth</text><text start="881.06" dur="6.1">got it so it seems like there&apos;s and also</text><text start="884.459" dur="4.5">like if you if and another thing and one</text><text start="887.16" dur="4.979">other thing uh about the collectivism</text><text start="888.959" dur="5.041">versus the individual is that Noah Smith</text><text start="892.139" dur="3.901">for example on Twitter</text><text start="894.0" dur="4.98">um you know he was talking about how he</text><text start="896.04" dur="5.099">tried to find good solar Punk stories uh</text><text start="898.98" dur="5.099">with like you know characters</text><text start="901.139" dur="4.981">um telling a journey and he was like</text><text start="904.079" dur="4.861">there are there are literally zero solar</text><text start="906.12" dur="4.8">Punk stories and it&apos;s because I think in</text><text start="908.94" dur="3.72">my opinion this is now this is kind of</text><text start="910.92" dur="4.26">my interpretation of why this is is</text><text start="912.66" dur="5.1">happening is because there&apos;s no</text><text start="915.18" dur="4.56">um kind of hero at the at the center of</text><text start="917.76" dur="3.78">solar Punk and it&apos;s because uh everybody</text><text start="919.74" dur="4.02">kind of minimizes themselves for the for</text><text start="921.54" dur="4.739">the collective and so with that there&apos;s</text><text start="923.76" dur="4.139">not uh much of a story to tell there&apos;s</text><text start="926.279" dur="4.56">no journey to go on</text><text start="927.899" dur="5.341">got it so you contrast it with terrapunk</text><text start="930.839" dur="4.5">which is high growth using technology to</text><text start="933.24" dur="3.719">solve Humanity&apos;s problems therefore</text><text start="935.339" dur="4.321">there can be a sort of hero&apos;s journey</text><text start="936.959" dur="4.201">that&apos;s up and to the right uh because</text><text start="939.66" dur="3.539">we&apos;re expanding out to the Stars we&apos;re</text><text start="941.16" dur="3.72">maintaining our economy and are</text><text start="943.199" dur="4.44">maintaining our</text><text start="944.88" dur="4.86">um the Earth and sustainability and so</text><text start="947.639" dur="4.861">so on and it shouldn&apos;t just rely on like</text><text start="949.74" dur="7.98">one hero it should be that everybody has</text><text start="952.5" dur="7.199">the resources to go on their own</text><text start="957.72" dur="3.419">kind of hero&apos;s journey yeah I mean I</text><text start="959.699" dur="3.541">think one of the you know the sort of</text><text start="961.139" dur="5.161">ideas that we discussed on this podcast</text><text start="963.24" dur="5.339">a little bit is creating change of self</text><text start="966.3" dur="4.8">but also change of system so basically</text><text start="968.579" dur="4.62">how can we build you know this is this</text><text start="971.1" dur="3.96">is a podcast that&apos;s about crypto and</text><text start="973.199" dur="5.88">it&apos;s about web3 and what kind of</text><text start="975.06" dur="6.12">civilization does web3 programmers want</text><text start="979.079" dur="4.26">to build and so a lot of this debate</text><text start="981.18" dur="5.04">between lunar Punk solar Punk Tara Punk</text><text start="983.339" dur="5.521">is about imagineering what kind of world</text><text start="986.22" dur="5.28">that we want to create and</text><text start="988.86" dur="4.62">um you know I&apos;m wondering you know how</text><text start="991.5" dur="4.74">that hero&apos;s journey fits into the web 3</text><text start="993.48" dur="4.2">space and and you know if I&apos;m an</text><text start="996.24" dur="3.659">entrepreneur or someone who&apos;s</text><text start="997.68" dur="5.279">participating in the web 3 space how can</text><text start="999.899" dur="4.761">I route my resources or uh my attention</text><text start="1002.959" dur="4.921">to things that are actually going to be</text><text start="1004.66" dur="5.5">Pro humanity and it seems like also Pro</text><text start="1007.88" dur="5.519">economy and there&apos;s a space for kind of</text><text start="1010.16" dur="4.02">a pluralism of Heroes Journeys here to</text><text start="1013.399" dur="2.94">help</text><text start="1014.18" dur="3.839">to if this is the direction that the</text><text start="1016.339" dur="3.781">community decides to go there&apos;s a</text><text start="1018.019" dur="5.281">pluralism of of Hero&apos;s Journeys in order</text><text start="1020.12" dur="5.579">to uh take us to a more terrapunk world</text><text start="1023.3" dur="3.96">if if that&apos;s what people have</text><text start="1025.699" dur="2.941">um decided so I guess you know do you</text><text start="1027.26" dur="3.36">have any comments on sort of what you</text><text start="1028.64" dur="3.96">see out of web 3 do you think web3 is</text><text start="1030.62" dur="4.5">more solar Punk Cypher Punk Tara Punk</text><text start="1032.6" dur="4.8">and you know if so how can how can</text><text start="1035.12" dur="4.679">people practically apply these meth like</text><text start="1037.4" dur="3.539">these ideas these imaginations in their</text><text start="1039.799" dur="3.721">designs</text><text start="1040.939" dur="3.36">yeah that&apos;s a great question</text><text start="1043.52" dur="4.5">um</text><text start="1044.299" dur="6.721">so perhaps there&apos;s ways or ways to uh</text><text start="1048.02" dur="5.22">utilize the the blockchain or web 3 for</text><text start="1051.02" dur="4.14">terrapunk Technologies I&apos;m not exactly</text><text start="1053.24" dur="3.84">sure what that would be but I would say</text><text start="1055.16" dur="4.44">like it like because that&apos;s a that&apos;s a</text><text start="1057.08" dur="4.2">future Tech like it needs to be built</text><text start="1059.6" dur="3.6">um and if I knew what it was like I</text><text start="1061.28" dur="4.019">would probably just go do it</text><text start="1063.2" dur="4.56">um but I would say that in terms of like</text><text start="1065.299" dur="4.74">current examples that are happening is</text><text start="1067.76" dur="4.74">for example you know vitalik obviously</text><text start="1070.039" dur="6.601">he&apos;s he&apos;s uh made a lot of money from</text><text start="1072.5" dur="6.78">ethereum and he&apos;s started to uh donate</text><text start="1076.64" dur="4.98">that or invest that in startups or</text><text start="1079.28" dur="5.7">technology uh creating these kind of</text><text start="1081.62" dur="6.12">like longevity uh you know human</text><text start="1084.98" dur="5.64">increasing human lifespan increasing uh</text><text start="1087.74" dur="5.4">biology research uh these kind of ideas</text><text start="1090.62" dur="3.96">that are that are similar to Tara Punk</text><text start="1093.14" dur="3.899">veins and so it&apos;s kind of like taking</text><text start="1094.58" dur="3.959">the money that he made from web3 or</text><text start="1097.039" dur="3.121">ethereum or however you want to phrase</text><text start="1098.539" dur="4.201">it and then investing it in these</text><text start="1100.16" dur="4.44">futuristic Technologies I think that&apos;s</text><text start="1102.74" dur="4.5">to me the most concrete example people</text><text start="1104.6" dur="5.16">that I&apos;ve seen so far and then you know</text><text start="1107.24" dur="5.1">there&apos;s also art um the web3 community</text><text start="1109.76" dur="5.22">is incredible at creating Aesthetics and</text><text start="1112.34" dur="4.86">memes and uh kind of propagating these</text><text start="1114.98" dur="4.98">and you know you know maybe maybe</text><text start="1117.2" dur="4.92">there&apos;s a there&apos;s a way for nfts or art</text><text start="1119.96" dur="5.579">to be created about

like we&apos;re in this cycle</text><text start="1242.0" dur="3.78">of kind of defining the world that we</text><text start="1244.46" dur="3.54">want to live in and then building the</text><text start="1245.78" dur="3.6">world that we want to live in and you</text><text start="1248.0" dur="3.84">know I&apos;m curious to zoom out a little</text><text start="1249.38" dur="4.98">bit and to look Beyond just solar Punk</text><text start="1251.84" dur="4.8">and terrapunken and</text><text start="1254.36" dur="5.52">um you know what what do you think of of</text><text start="1256.64" dur="5.58">things like lunar Punk uh or or Cypher</text><text start="1259.88" dur="4.44">pumpkin and how do they fit into tear up</text><text start="1262.22" dur="4.199">on click if lunar Punk is basically</text><text start="1264.32" dur="4.739">solar Punk but with more focus on</text><text start="1266.419" dur="4.561">privacy and sovereignty is that Tara</text><text start="1269.059" dur="3.901">Punk also do you think it&apos;s even useful</text><text start="1270.98" dur="4.5">to ask that question are we creating a</text><text start="1272.96" dur="4.86">pluralism of punks like how do you think</text><text start="1275.48" dur="4.199">how do you think Terra Punk uh compares</text><text start="1277.82" dur="3.3">to other things besides besides solar</text><text start="1279.679" dur="3.86">Punk and is that even a useful question</text><text start="1281.12" dur="2.419">to ask</text><text start="1285.2" dur="2.76">yeah</text><text start="1286.52" dur="2.76">um so you kind of cut out a little bit</text><text start="1287.96" dur="3.06">but I think</text><text start="1289.28" dur="4.56">um from what you were asking is like is</text><text start="1291.02" dur="4.44">is uh lunar Punk kind of a subdivision</text><text start="1293.84" dur="4.98">of terrapunk or is it like its own thing</text><text start="1295.46" dur="5.4">I I did discuss privacy a little bit in</text><text start="1298.82" dur="4.8">the terrapunk manifesto uh or</text><text start="1300.86" dur="5.52">decentralization mostly like with</text><text start="1303.62" dur="5.4">respect to decentralization of resource</text><text start="1306.38" dur="4.919">so like uh I should be able to create</text><text start="1309.02" dur="4.68">like my own energy be off the grid um</text><text start="1311.299" dur="3.061">that kind of thing if I wanted to</text><text start="1313.7" dur="3.54">um</text><text start="1314.36" dur="4.92">so I and and I don&apos;t know a ton about</text><text start="1317.24" dur="4.02">lunar Punk I&apos;d love to listen to the</text><text start="1319.28" dur="3.96">podcast that&apos;s going to come out uh on</text><text start="1321.26" dur="3.96">lunar Punk that you just recorded and</text><text start="1323.24" dur="4.62">mentioned to me uh but I I wish I had a</text><text start="1325.22" dur="4.14">better answer for that right okay that&apos;s</text><text start="1327.86" dur="4.439">fine this part kind of part of why we&apos;re</text><text start="1329.36" dur="5.34">doing all these podcasts together is to</text><text start="1332.299" dur="4.681">um compare all the different punks that</text><text start="1334.7" dur="4.32">that web3 thinks it is and compare and</text><text start="1336.98" dur="4.679">contrast them and no it&apos;s great to learn</text><text start="1339.02" dur="4.92">about station yeah</text><text start="1341.659" dur="6.081">yeah um what what didn&apos;t I ask you about</text><text start="1343.94" dur="3.8">terrapunk that that you want to tell us</text><text start="1348.08" dur="5.52">um just like uh</text><text start="1350.24" dur="6.179">I just want more futuristic optimistic</text><text start="1353.6" dur="4.74">art that features humans because a lot</text><text start="1356.419" dur="5.161">of the a lot of the art is just Greenery</text><text start="1358.34" dur="5.219">without humans and uh you know I&apos;m I&apos;m</text><text start="1361.58" dur="5.66">looking at the terrible Manifesto and</text><text start="1363.559" dur="5.821">and it&apos;s the art section and it&apos;s like</text><text start="1367.24" dur="3.4">after defeating the villain the Tara</text><text start="1369.38" dur="2.64">Punk continues using their Newfound</text><text start="1370.64" dur="3.3">skills to transform the environment</text><text start="1372.02" dur="3.6">around them uh for example after Iron</text><text start="1373.94" dur="3.0">Man creates a suit in the cave he</text><text start="1375.62" dur="3.179">doesn&apos;t stop at Mach 1 after defeating</text><text start="1376.94" dur="3.9">the villain he also begins using his</text><text start="1378.799" dur="3.24">Newfound technology to power the city in</text><text start="1380.84" dur="3.06">each of the stories he contends who&apos;s</text><text start="1382.039" dur="4.14">evolving and fighting fighting larger</text><text start="1383.9" dur="4.259">scale enemies he&apos;s proactive like he</text><text start="1386.179" dur="4.561">keeps uh evolving his technology in</text><text start="1388.159" dur="3.961">advance of of the threats uh I just I</text><text start="1390.74" dur="4.319">just really want</text><text start="1392.12" dur="5.0">um incredible art to be created and this</text><text start="1395.059" dur="5.221">this kind of comes back to how Hollywood</text><text start="1397.12" dur="5.32">is very pessimistic about technology</text><text start="1400.28" dur="3.3">like if you go watch the new Jurassic</text><text start="1402.44" dur="3.119">World</text><text start="1403.58" dur="4.32">um it&apos;s basically there&apos;s autistic Tim</text><text start="1405.559" dur="4.141">Cook uh being portrayed as the villain</text><text start="1407.9" dur="3.84">and it&apos;s like like what are we doing</text><text start="1409.7" dur="4.5">here like Tim Cook didn&apos;t even create</text><text start="1411.74" dur="3.419">Apple but you know it&apos;s like it&apos;s this</text><text start="1414.2" dur="2.88">whole thing</text><text start="1415.159" dur="3.481">um and and there&apos;s this thing where if</text><text start="1417.08" dur="4.079">somebody gave her blood a little bit</text><text start="1418.64" dur="4.919">like she could save the world but it&apos;s</text><text start="1421.159" dur="4.26">bad to do that it&apos;s like it&apos;s just all</text><text start="1423.559" dur="5.821">convoluted and it doesn&apos;t make sense and</text><text start="1425.419" dur="6.481">I just want better uh stories to tell uh</text><text start="1429.38" dur="4.14">they&apos;re more more optimistic and and</text><text start="1431.9" dur="3.0">real sci-fi</text><text start="1433.52" dur="3.899">um so that&apos;s one thing yeah it&apos;s</text><text start="1434.9" dur="5.04">definitely the art is just I&apos;m I&apos;m not</text><text start="1437.419" dur="5.701">uh altogether pleased with with current</text><text start="1439.94" dur="5.9">Hollywood mm-hmm yeah and I I will note</text><text start="1443.12" dur="4.919">that uh Punk Twitter account I think is</text><text start="1445.84" dur="4.0">Iron Man is Hollywood</text><text start="1448.039" dur="3.301">yeah</text><text start="1449.84" dur="3.24">um the terrapunk Twitter account is</text><text start="1451.34" dur="3.78">you&apos;ve asked people if they create Terra</text><text start="1453.08" dur="3.66">Punk art to tag you to tag that Twitter</text><text start="1455.12" dur="3.0">account and you&apos;ll retweet it and</text><text start="1456.74" dur="3.96">hopefully that can proliferate more</text><text start="1458.12" dur="5.76">imagination about High-Tech high human</text><text start="1460.7" dur="7.44">Pro markets kind of worlds</text><text start="1463.88" dur="6.779">totally and yeah so to uh one one thing</text><text start="1468.14" dur="5.34">that uh one of the pictures that I have</text><text start="1470.659" dur="5.481">is uh it&apos;s kind of these stone hands</text><text start="1473.48" dur="4.86">that are that are uh larger than humans</text><text start="1476.14" dur="4.539">uh maybe they&apos;re they&apos;re like 20 feet</text><text start="1478.34" dur="4.02">tall and they&apos;re holding this uh walkway</text><text start="1480.679" dur="3.24">this bridge and so it&apos;s like this large</text><text start="1482.36" dur="3.96">human and it&apos;s kind of holding this</text><text start="1483.919" dur="4.14">bridge that humans are walking on</text><text start="1486.32" dur="3.78">um and so that that was like a really</text><text start="1488.059" dur="3.841">cool like okay you know we should have</text><text start="1490.1" dur="5.52">larger than life humans we should have</text><text start="1491.9" dur="6.0">like the stat uh the Colossus of Roads</text><text start="1495.62" dur="4.919">um you know marking our waterways</text><text start="1497.9" dur="4.98">um and so and so if there&apos;s any artist</text><text start="1500.539" dur="4.741">listening to this one the idea that I</text><text start="1502.88" dur="5.22">have is this this kind of like Atlas</text><text start="1505.28" dur="6.18">Shrugged character uh kneeling over this</text><text start="1508.1" dur="5.52">like you know he&apos;s uh he&apos;s kneeling and</text><text start="1511.46" dur="4.5">beneath his knees is this is the city</text><text start="1513.62" dur="4.559">like this massive City but he&apos;s Atlas is</text><text start="1515.96" dur="3.78">just so massive he&apos;s he&apos;s massive uh</text><text start="1518.179" dur="3.721">there&apos;s a ring of mountains surrounding</text><text start="1519.74" dur="4.08">him and there&apos;s like a terraformed Mars</text><text start="1521.9" dur="5.04">like on his on his shoulders that&apos;s like</text><text start="1523.82" dur="4.5">one terabunk image that I have that I&apos;ve</text><text start="1526.94" dur="3.3">been trying to create with dolly or</text><text start="1528.32" dur="3.3">something like that but um yeah if</text><text start="1530.24" dur="2.88">anybody tweets these kind of things at</text><text start="1531.62" dur="3.299">me I&apos;ll definitely retweet them on the</text><text start="1533.12" dur="5.7">Tara Punk account I would love that</text><text start="1534.919" dur="5.821">right well you know um I I I&apos;m not sure</text><text start="1538.82" dur="4.5">that</text><text start="1540.74" dur="4.319">I&apos;m not sure that I agree with the uh</text><text start="1543.32" dur="2.94">some of the criticisms of solar like I</text><text start="1545.059" dur="5.22">don&apos;t think that solar Punk is an art</text><text start="1546.26" dur="5.94">movement goes on record about markets</text><text start="1550.279" dur="3.481">um and but but yeah maybe the community</text><text start="1552.2" dur="4.2">around solar Punk has gone on record</text><text start="1553.76" dur="5.519">about that but I do think that the web 3</text><text
