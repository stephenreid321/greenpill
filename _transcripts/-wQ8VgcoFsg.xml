guess we can start from</text><text start="233.459" dur="5.401">there I think uh I&apos;m working on like a</text><text start="236.519" dur="4.561">bunch of topics that that all seem to be</text><text

to</text><text start="251.099" dur="3.72">work across a bunch of subject matters</text><text start="252.9" dur="3.36">and then when you have that breadth</text><text start="254.819" dur="3.721">first you can kind of combine things</text><text start="256.26" dur="4.02">from different domains and being a</text><text start="258.54" dur="3.06">connector allows you to kind of see the</text><text

the threat of quadratic voting</text><text start="265.919" dur="3.72">and the user experience problems there</text><text start="267.9" dur="4.26">you want to tell us about that post</text><text start="269.639" dur="5.221">yeah yeah so</text><text start="272.16" dur="5.64">um it&apos;s essentially all of that starts</text><text start="274.86" dur="5.339">with a a client that I&apos;ve been working</text><text start="277.8" dur="3.54">with and and so I&apos;m a basically I&apos;m a</text><text start="280.199" dur="4.56">freelancer</text><text start="281.34" dur="6.24">uh and I was contacted by this um yeah</text><text start="284.759" dur="6.0">like quite renowned artist</text><text start="287.58" dur="5.1">um from Germany called Hitler style and</text><text start="290.759" dur="4.621">um and we wanted to do a project</text><text start="292.68" dur="4.98">together and then it it turned out that</text><text start="295.38" dur="5.099">uh</text><text start="297.66" dur="4.44">like through some you know like we we</text><text start="300.479" dur="3.421">didn&apos;t really like know in the beginning</text><text start="302.1" dur="3.599">like what we really wanted to do and so</text><text start="303.9" dur="3.72">we were like thinking of kind of like</text><text start="305.699" dur="4.381">different projects that we wanted to do</text><text start="307.62" dur="4.56">I think one was like a more like a more</text><text start="310.08" dur="4.559">of a game and it had to do with like</text><text start="312.18" dur="6.48">property titles and so on but eventually</text><text start="314.639" dur="8.821">they ended up registering the uh the ens</text><text start="318.66" dur="7.74">domain name of uh the the bundesla in in</text><text start="323.46" dur="6.66">Germany which is a a German federally</text><text start="326.4" dur="5.88">funded uh art exhibition Hall and so</text><text start="330.12" dur="4.34">through that like all of a sudden there</text><text start="332.28" dur="5.639">was like a conversation started around</text><text start="334.46" dur="5.56">this idea of what minting and ens name</text><text start="337.919" dur="5.34">really means and and the powers that it</text><text start="340.02" dur="5.28">gives you and uh and and like by</text><text start="343.259" dur="5.401">collaborating also with the like with</text><text start="345.3" dur="5.459">the curators of the bonus tale then uh</text><text start="348.66" dur="3.78">basically they they were like yeah but</text><text start="350.759" dur="4.801">that&apos;s actually interesting that you are</text><text start="352.44" dur="6.12">now owning this ens domain and so you</text><text start="355.56" dur="5.699">know maybe given that you you have that</text><text start="358.56" dur="6.06">and that you are going on strike kind of</text><text start="361.259" dur="5.94">where uh you know maybe we can we can</text><text start="364.62" dur="4.26">have like a governance uh vote on you</text><text start="367.199" dur="5.461">know what what should be the future of</text><text start="368.88" dur="4.56">the the German uh and so</text><text start="372.66" dur="3.66">um</text><text start="373.44" dur="4.56">so I think that&apos;s kind of how this</text><text start="376.32" dur="2.4">entire thing</text><text start="378.0" dur="2.94">um</text><text start="378.72" dur="5.28">ended up like like started essentially</text><text start="380.94" dur="6.9">and and what uh what eventually happened</text><text start="384.0" dur="7.62">is that we had a like a recording in in</text><text start="387.84" dur="5.88">um in a TV studio where we had three</text><text start="391.62" dur="5.12">different governance proposals similar</text><text start="393.72" dur="6.479">to how you would do it on snapshot.org</text><text start="396.74" dur="6.1">nowadays with like a with a Dao we have</text><text start="400.199" dur="5.701">that uh we had these three proposals</text><text start="402.84" dur="4.799">being like um you know presented by by</text><text start="405.9" dur="3.359">three different parties there is the</text><text start="407.639" dur="4.441">there was the department of</text><text start="409.259" dur="5.701">decentralization that is organizing uh</text><text start="412.08" dur="4.8">East Berlin then there was um someone</text><text start="414.96" dur="4.98">from other internet</text><text start="416.88" dur="6.24">uh which is kind of like this Arts and</text><text start="419.94" dur="5.819">Technology research uh group and then I</text><text start="423.12" dur="5.04">think the last uh party was uh to put</text><text start="425.759" dur="4.401">the the like institutional like the</text><text start="428.16" dur="6.42">institution itself</text><text start="430.16" dur="7.12">uh and I think it I I think it it must</text><text start="434.58" dur="3.959">have been there like president or or CEO</text><text start="437.28" dur="3.66">or whatever</text><text start="438.539" dur="5.461">um that was also making a proposal and</text><text start="440.94" dur="4.979">after having uh you know after after</text><text start="444.0" dur="4.319">everyone making their proposal on stage</text><text start="445.919" dur="4.741">and we had this also uh you know live</text><text start="448.319" dur="4.921">streamed on the internet through YouTube</text><text start="450.66" dur="4.08">um the audience had the choice or had</text><text start="453.24" dur="5.34">the chance of</text><text start="454.74" dur="6.239">um doing a quadratic vote on the on the</text><text start="458.58" dur="4.86">proposals that they they like most and</text><text start="460.979" dur="4.741">and that&apos;s kind of where where I I was</text><text start="463.44" dur="4.979">involved the entire in the entire</text><text start="465.72" dur="4.56">project where um I basically I was</text><text start="468.419" dur="4.981">developing this uh quadratic voting</text><text start="470.28" dur="5.039">application and can we just back up for</text><text start="473.4" dur="4.68">a second talk about why quadratic voting</text><text start="475.319" dur="4.261">so quadratic voting is is known to be a</text><text start="478.08" dur="3.3">way of doing voting where you can</text><text start="479.58" dur="3.959">express not only your preferences but</text><text start="481.38" dur="3.539">the direction and the intensity of your</text><text start="483.539" dur="2.461">preferences and basically the way it</text><text start="484.919" dur="2.881">works is you get a certain amount of</text><text start="486.0" dur="3.84">voting credits and then you can spend</text><text start="487.8" dur="4.38">one voting credit to get one vote you</text><text start="489.84" dur="4.68">can spend uh I think it&apos;s four voting</text><text start="492.18" dur="4.38">credits to get two votes you can spend</text><text start="494.52" dur="4.679">16 voting credits to get four votes so</text><text start="496.56" dur="5.94">the amount of votes you get is the</text><text start="499.199" dur="5.161">um is the square of or sorry the the</text><text start="502.5" dur="3.3">square root of of the voting credits</text><text start="504.36" dur="3.779">that you spend on that particular issue</text><text start="505.8" dur="4.799">and so I could vote uh I want to vote</text><text start="508.139" dur="5.101">four votes for option A which cost me 16</text><text start="510.599" dur="4.62">voting credits one vote against option b</text><text start="513.24" dur="3.9">and one vote against option C and in</text><text start="515.219" dur="4.74">total I have used 18 voting credits so</text><text start="517.14" dur="4.68">it allows you to you look at the</text><text start="519.959" dur="3.181">intensity and the directionality of your</text><text start="521.82" dur="2.639">preferences</text><text start="523.14" dur="3.06">um I hope I got that right but why did</text><text start="524.459" dur="5.521">you all choose quadratic voting in this</text><text start="526.2" dur="6.36">instance yeah yeah I think it was I mean</text><text start="529.98" dur="5.76">I don&apos;t know the the the entire reasons</text><text start="532.56" dur="7.8">but I think it was it was for for that</text><text start="535.74" dur="7.68">reason to uh you know I think I I mean I</text><text start="540.36" dur="6.9">can&apos;t speak for he told myself but I</text><text start="543.42" dur="5.58">think the the idea was that uh we we had</text><text start="547.26" dur="5.16">read about this concept of quadratic</text><text start="549.0" dur="4.38">voting and uh you know she&apos;s uh she&apos;s</text><text start="552.42" dur="4.32">like</text><text start="553.38" dur="6.3">uh it&apos;s essentially like working also on</text><text start="556.74" dur="4.98">like critiquing a lot of like what</text><text start="559.68" dur="6.12">happens in the world and in the arts art</text><text start="561.72" dur="8.28">world and so on and so uh I I think a</text><text start="565.8" dur="7.68">you know a theoretical critique on how</text><text start="570.0" dur="5.16">uh Glenn Glenn will you know outlined</text><text start="573.48" dur="3.359">this idea of quadratic voting in the</text><text start="575.16" dur="4.26">book where you know we would have come</text><text start="576.839" dur="4.68">together created this uh this you know</text><text start="579.42" dur="4.919">like this paper that basically you know</text><text start="581.519" dur="6.061">go goes against whatever is set in the</text><text start="584.339" dur="6.661">radical markets book failed like it</text><text start="587.58" dur="4.199">didn&apos;t feel right and so I think the it</text><text start="591.0" dur="2.88">was</text><text start="591.779" dur="5.041">basically an attempt at you know</text><text start="593.88" dur="5.04">critiquing the concept by uh you know</text><text start="596.82" dur="4.38">doing what an entrepreneur would do and</text><text start="598.92" dur="4.62">so essentially by you know building it</text><text start="601.2" dur="4.079">testing it and and then coming back to</text><text start="603.54" dur="3.359">the drawing button you know being like</text><text start="605.279" dur="4.141">okay you know this these are the things</text><text start="606.899" dur="4.021">that we have learned and and uh and</text><text start="609.42" dur="3.24">these you know these are the things that</text><text start="610.92" dur="3.78">worked and that didn&apos;t</text><text start="612.66" dur="3.66">um yeah so I think on on that end I</text><text start="614.7" dur="3.84">think we um</text><text start="616.32" dur="5.04">uh it was very interesting because it</text><text start="618.54" dur="5.52">ended up leading to yeah to this blog</text><text start="621.36" dur="4.44">post that you that you mentioned</text><text start="624.06" dur="5.279">right</text><text start="625.8" dur="5.88">got it and so um I see from the post</text><text start="629.339" dur="4.081">that there was there was you know</text><text start="631.68" dur="3.3">several conceptual user experience</text><text start="633.42" dur="3.24">problems that you ran into during the</text><text start="634.98" dur="3.419">implementation would be would be fun to</text><text start="636.66" dur="3.9">unfurl those I&apos;m not sure how many of</text><text start="638.399" dur="5.221">the audience with has done a quadratic</text><text start="640.56" dur="5.1">vote.co but or a quadratic vote before</text><text start="643.62" dur="3.6">but you could do one at quadraticvote.co</text><text start="645.66" dur="3.72">if you&apos;re looking to do a very easy</text><text start="647.22" dur="4.26">quadratic vote and maybe some of these</text><text start="649.38" dur="3.18">These Years user experience issues or</text><text start="651.48" dur="2.22">some some things that we can talk</text><text start="652.56" dur="2.16">through so you want to you want to take</text><text start="653.7" dur="3.9">us through this</text><text start="654.72" dur="5.4">yeah sure so</text><text start="657.6" dur="4.919">I I think</text><text start="660.12" dur="5.339">I mean I wanna I think I want to talk</text><text start="662.519" dur="5.041">about kind of I guess like where I also</text><text start="665.459" dur="3.741">was challenged as a developer here I</text><text start="667.56" dur="3.959">think the the</text><text start="669.2" dur="4.18">mainly to point out in the beginning I</text><text start="671.519" dur="4.44">think that this is a like quadratic</text><text start="673.38" dur="5.16">voting is a thing that we as a community</text><text start="675.959" dur="4.861">have very little experience with also in</text><text start="678.54" dur="4.26">terms of you know just how how are we</text><text start="680.82" dur="6.06">building like user interfaces how are we</text><text start="682.8" dur="6.479">you know laying like outlaying this um</text><text start="686.88" dur="5.22">yeah the interface itself how you know</text><text start="689.279" dur="6.18">what what is the mental model that we uh</text><text start="692.1" dur="6.419">need to you know teach people on how all</text><text start="695.459" dur="5.101">of these things work and I think if I</text><text start="698.519" dur="3.961">had to summarize the entire blog post</text><text start="700.56" dur="4.86">then I think that that&apos;s the gist of it</text><text start="702.48" dur="4.979">is that it&apos;s you know you are basically</text><text start="705.42" dur="4.74">you are exposing people to this very new</text><text start="707.459" dur="5.88">kind of idea of a voting and then it&apos;s</text><text start="710.16" dur="4.38">also mathematical and um and and that&apos;s</text><text start="713.339" dur="4.981">I think like one of the biggest</text><text start="714.54" dur="7.08">challenges now in with regards to like</text><text start="718.32" dur="5.28">the uh to like the individual challenges</text><text start="721.62" dur="4.38">that we ended up uh running into this</text><text start="723.6" dur="4.14">there&apos;s a couple of them and I basically</text><text start="726.0" dur="6.06">in this blog post I list them all like</text><text start="727.74" dur="7.68">one by one uh I I can maybe go like</text><text start="732.06" dur="6.06">briefly through each of them and um and</text><text start="735.42" dur="4.62">and we can maybe like dive in Depot on</text><text start="738.12" dur="3.899">on like things that that you&apos;re also</text><text start="740.04" dur="3.96">interested right I think yeah and I&apos;ll</text><text start="742.019" dur="3.361">just say why I&apos;m interested in this</text><text start="744.0" dur="2.82">um is that we&apos;re trying to create a more</text><text start="745.38" dur="3.36">regenerative world with higher</text><text start="746.82" dur="4.079">resolution democracy that leverages</text><text start="748.74" dur="3.96">collective intelligence and I think that</text><text start="750.899" dur="4.38">there&apos;s a certain like Economist eye</text><text start="752.7" dur="3.84">view that designs these mechanisms and</text><text start="755.279" dur="3.841">thinks about how they&apos;re perfectly</text><text start="756.54" dur="4.5">rational sort of on paper but then you</text><text start="759.12" dur="4.98">put them in front of actual humans which</text><text start="761.04" dur="4.68">are predictably irrational and are</text><text start="764.1" dur="3.0">really Guided by the user interface and</text><text start="765.72" dur="3.66">it&apos;s really important that we close the</text><text start="767.1" dur="4.14">gap between these perceptual problems</text><text start="769.38" dur="2.82">and the mechanistic things that are in</text><text start="771.24" dur="2.399">the design so I just want to say that</text><text start="772.2" dur="4.259">out loud before we go into these things</text><text start="773.639" dur="4.38">yeah totally totally I think that&apos;s a</text><text start="776.459" dur="4.021">really like that&apos;s a really important</text><text start="778.019" dur="4.981">point and I think it it also kind of</text><text start="780.48" dur="4.74">touches on the on the first problem that</text><text start="783.0" dur="5.76">I outlined and that maybe I&apos;m not even</text><text start="785.22" dur="6.059">100 capable of of reproducing but I</text><text start="788.76" dur="6.78">think in the in the radical markets book</text><text start="791.279" dur="6.721">itself the uh the the idea of quadratic</text><text start="795.54" dur="4.919">voting is basically derived from this</text><text start="798.0" dur="4.2">idea of uh you know the categorical</text><text start="800.459" dur="4.62">imperative</text><text start="802.2" dur="5.34">um where you know you say basically that</text><text start="805.079" dur="5.281">a person&apos;s Freedom</text><text start="807.54" dur="5.76">um you know is limited by you know where</text><text start="810.36" dur="4.56">they are intercept like in where they&apos;re</text><text start="813.3" dur="3.96">basically starting to limit another</text><text start="814.92" dur="4.859">person&apos;s Freedom right so like I think</text><text start="817.26" dur="4.5">for example like I think during covet</text><text start="819.779" dur="4.441">and you know with mask wearing I think</text><text start="821.76" dur="5.04">this uh this started to have like a</text><text start="824.22" dur="5.4">practical relevancy where you know if</text><text start="826.8" dur="5.46">you were a you know a fit young person</text><text start="829.62" dur="5.219">then you know for you potentially the</text><text start="832.26" dur="5.16">the virus was like less fatal than let&apos;s</text><text start="834.839" dur="4.62">say for an older person but uh you know</text><text start="837.42" dur="4.38">that that should like in the categorical</text><text start="839.459" dur="4.861">imperative that morally still doesn&apos;t</text><text start="841.8" dur="4.44">give you really the the like right to</text><text start="844.32" dur="4.019">not wear a mask because you know mask</text><text start="846.24" dur="4.98">wearing also means you are protecting</text><text start="848.339" dur="5.161">the other person and so if basically if</text><text start="851.22" dur="4.32">you know as a let&apos;s say as a young fit</text><text start="853.5" dur="4.2">person I stop wearing masks and I end up</text><text start="855.54" dur="4.38">you know infecting other people then you</text><text start="857.7" dur="3.96">know my my freedom is suddenly limiting</text><text start="859.92" dur="4.56">the freedom of other people where where</text><text start="861.66" dur="5.52">for example we are like uh you know you</text><text start="864.48" dur="5.94">know where I&apos;m like becoming a</text><text start="867.18" dur="4.74">coming to in close proximity to like a</text><text start="870.42" dur="5.28">more vulnerable person or something like</text><text start="871.92" dur="6.719">this and so I think the the uh the</text><text start="875.7" dur="4.56">radical markets book uh understands the</text><text start="878.639" dur="3.721">categorical imperative and it&apos;s very</text><text start="880.26" dur="3.12">interesting actually that then you know</text><text start="882.36" dur="3.0">the</text><text start="883.38" dur="5.519">what they&apos;re basically saying is that</text><text start="885.36" dur="5.7">you know we we can also codify this uh</text><text start="888.899" dur="3.3">this moral this moral thing into math</text><text start="891.06" dur="4.26">and so</text><text start="892.199" dur="5.7">the the idea here is where uh you know</text><text start="895.32" dur="5.579">you have this uh this town and</text><text start="897.899" dur="5.101">um you you know there&apos;s a um a</text><text start="900.899" dur="4.021">electricity plant and it&apos;s producing</text><text start="903.0" dur="4.139">energy but it&apos;s also polluting the air</text><text start="904.92" dur="5.039">where the air is the public is the</text><text start="907.139" dur="5.341">public good and then the the book kind</text><text start="909.959" dur="4.861">of the book walks us through this this</text><text start="912.48" dur="5.28">trade-off between you know people on one</text><text start="914.82" dur="5.819">side needing uh cheap energy but also</text><text start="917.76" dur="5.1">they cannot really have like the entire</text><text start="920.639" dur="5.281">air being polluted and and additionally</text><text start="922.86" dur="6.24">you know some some people might say that</text><text start="925.92" dur="5.46">um you you know air pollution is fine if</text><text start="929.1" dur="4.2">I get a cheap energy and and other</text><text start="931.38" dur="5.16">people might say the inverse and so and</text><text start="933.3" dur="6.839">and the the book outlines this example</text><text start="936.54" dur="6.539">of Niels where uh where Niels</text><text start="940.139" dur="4.56">essentially uh I I think cannot cannot</text><text start="943.079" dur="3.961">have that much air pollution because</text><text start="944.699" dur="4.681">Niels is running a</text><text start="947.04" dur="4.14">um is running a laundry</text><text start="949.38" dur="5.16">um and so I guess that&apos;s because he</text><text start="951.18" dur="5.159">needs to hang the the clothes up up in</text><text start="954.54" dur="3.96">the end so if there&apos;s polluted and I</text><text start="956.339" dur="4.381">guess the closer smelly afterwards or</text><text start="958.5" dur="4.139">something like this and and so and so</text><text start="960.72" dur="3.78">kind of given this categorical</text><text start="962.639" dur="4.64">imperative of</text><text start="964.5" dur="6.54">um of of you know like</text><text start="967.279" dur="6.941">you know this symmetry of everyone you</text><text start="971.04" dur="6.359">know having kind of this the same say in</text><text start="974.22" dur="5.52">in this uh in the in the public good uh</text><text start="977.399" dur="5.581">of of air quality I think they they</text><text start="979.74" dur="6.2">basically derive this math of saying</text><text start="982.98" dur="6.539">that you know if Niels wants to impose</text><text start="985.94" dur="6.16">certain qualities on other people that</text><text start="989.519" dur="4.141">live in the town then you know Niels</text><text start="992.1" dur="4.02">should pay the quadratic cost of that</text><text start="993.66" dur="5.28">because basically news is like</text><text start="996.12" dur="6.12">influencing it you know news is not</text><text start="998.94" dur="5.639">causing a cost to uh you know to to</text><text start="1002.24" dur="4.44">himself only by for example increasing</text><text start="1004.579" dur="4.921">the electricity price but it&apos;s basically</text><text start="1006.68" dur="4.68">increasing a cost to ever everyone that</text><text start="1009.5" dur="6.18">lives in the town because he might have</text><text start="1011.36" dur="5.94">like a very Divergent uh a view on how</text><text start="1015.68" dur="3.36">things should work and so and and so</text><text start="1017.3" dur="3.479">basically they have like this they have</text><text start="1019.04" dur="5.58">like a graph I think you can see it in</text><text start="1020.779" dur="7.441">page 100 I have it here like 103 of the</text><text start="1024.62" dur="5.76">Princeton Princeton press Edition and</text><text start="1028.22" dur="4.079">and so I found that very interesting and</text><text start="1030.38" dur="3.419">I mean it makes to me it also</text><text start="1032.299" dur="5.04">economically it makes a lot of sense</text><text start="1033.799" dur="6.66">actually this and I you know I think at</text><text start="1037.339" dur="5.701">um at a shelling point in Bogota uh</text><text start="1040.459" dur="5.581">probably were so there I think there was</text><text start="1043.04" dur="4.62">a someone speaking on the plurality</text><text start="1046.04" dur="3.36">stage now I forgot the name but</text><text start="1047.66" dur="4.04">basically what they said is something</text><text start="1049.4" dur="2.3">like</text><text start="1051.74" dur="4.38">yeah that anyways like that that this is</text><text start="1054.2" dur="3.96">like you know it&apos;s beautiful that we can</text><text start="1056.12" dur="4.2">express basically this categorical</text><text start="1058.16" dur="4.08">imperative of math and so on but I think</text><text start="1060.32" dur="3.84">on the on the other on the other hand</text><text start="1062.24" dur="3.96">and this is what I was trying to point</text><text start="1064.16" dur="5.82">out with my blog post is that this</text><text start="1066.2" dur="6.359">social cost for voting is I mean it&apos;s</text><text start="1069.98" dur="5.64">really hard to to describe I think I I I</text><text start="1072.559" dur="5.041">tried it here and and I&apos;m not sure like</text><text start="1075.62" dur="4.86">how how well I&apos;m making myself</text><text start="1077.6" dur="5.579">understood but then also I think it it</text><text start="1080.48" dur="5.699">pre like it assumes essentially also</text><text start="1083.179" dur="5.641">somewhat of like a a very like high</text><text start="1086.179" dur="4.681">density information environment where</text><text start="1088.82" dur="4.56">everything can be boiled down into like</text><text start="1090.86" dur="4.62">costs so like you know for meals that is</text><text start="1093.38" dur="4.56">running a laundry I think makes really a</text><text start="1095.48" dur="4.559">lot of sense to you know to like make</text><text start="1097.94" dur="4.32">this trade-off between smelly clothes</text><text start="1100.039" dur="5.101">and and you know maybe</text><text start="1102.26" dur="5.039">um the laundry electricity costing less</text><text start="1105.14" dur="5.279">and so on right yeah yeah</text><text start="1107.299" dur="4.461">so it sort of presumes Education or a</text><text start="1110.419" dur="6.12">very simple</text><text start="1111.76" dur="7.12">problem to solve I think yeah but it I</text><text start="1116.539" dur="4.741">think it&apos;s also it also kind of suffers</text><text start="1118.88" dur="5.7">from looking at the looking at the</text><text start="1121.28" dur="5.82">problem uh very deliberately only in an</text><text start="1124.58" dur="4.86">economic model and for because for</text><text start="1127.1" dur="5.579">example I mean you know in the in the</text><text start="1129.44" dur="6.0">case of um you know pricing again like</text><text start="1132.679" dur="5.521">this uh the production cost of clean</text><text start="1135.44" dur="4.38">clothes in the laundry I think it&apos;s easy</text><text start="1138.2" dur="3.719">to kind of get an overview over that</text><text start="1139.82" dur="3.479">right but you might have also people and</text><text start="1141.919" dur="3.661">this goes back to what you said in the</text><text start="1143.299" dur="3.961">beginning where the</text><text start="1145.58" dur="4.5">uh</text><text start="1147.26" dur="5.82">maybe you cannot put a price on for</text><text start="1150.08" dur="4.979">example what what is the value of of</text><text start="1153.08" dur="5.82">clean air like for example when somebody</text><text start="1155.059" dur="6.24">is uh spiritually uh opposed to that I</text><text start="1158.9" dur="5.58">think this um this way of pricing things</text><text start="1161.299" dur="6.841">becomes uh um just much more complicated</text><text start="1164.48" dur="6.54">or if someone for example uh you know</text><text start="1168.14" dur="5.58">um has like a undiagnosed</text><text start="1171.02" dur="5.399">um lung condition and then so so then</text><text start="1173.72" dur="5.52">you know they never end up like uh you</text><text start="1176.419" dur="5.401">know paying for this externality that if</text><text start="1179.24" dur="5.64">they knew they had a a like a lung</text><text start="1181.82" dur="4.62">condition that you know can get worse</text><text start="1184.88" dur="3.9">with air pollution then they would also</text><text start="1186.44" dur="3.599">pay more so I think while I mean it&apos;s</text><text start="1188.78" dur="3.66">not really</text><text start="1190.039" dur="3.241">um it&apos;s not really a strong critique</text><text start="1192.44" dur="3.18">against</text><text start="1193.28" dur="3.6">um against a quadratic voting per se</text><text start="1195.62" dur="3.72">because these things can also happen</text><text start="1196.88" dur="4.38">with like regular voting I think it</text><text start="1199.34" dur="5.459">points kind of to this</text><text start="1201.26" dur="6.06">um to this uh flaw of of of of thinking</text><text start="1204.799" dur="4.921">everything in in the economic terms and</text><text start="1207.32" dur="5.04">and like in this like closed loop system</text><text start="1209.72" dur="3.48">and so on</text><text start="1212.36" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="1213.2" dur="4.32">yeah although I&apos;d love I I would love to</text><text start="1216.2" dur="3.18">like I know that we&apos;re going deep on the</text><text start="1217.52" dur="3.899">quadratic voting uh paper right now but</text><text start="1219.38" dur="4.38">I I think like in order to respect the</text><text start="1221.419" dur="3.601">breadth first nature of this episode I&apos;d</text><text start="1223.76" dur="2.88">love to take a little sample of the</text><text start="1225.02" dur="3.24">harbinger attack stuff and then a sample</text><text start="1226.64" dur="2.76">of the Soul bound token stuff and then</text><text start="1228.26" dur="2.88">we can get into a little bit more of a</text><text start="1229.4" dur="4.26">discussion uh towards the end of those</text><text start="1231.14" dur="3.96">how does that sound yeah sounds good</text><text start="1233.66" dur="3.0">cool uh where should we go next</text><text start="1235.1" dur="4.62">Harbinger taxes sold out tokens

audience knows exactly</text><text start="1248.36" dur="2.88">what those are why they&apos;re important and</text><text start="1249.98" dur="3.6">how they work</text><text start="1251.24" dur="6.48">yeah so</text><text start="1253.58" dur="6.719">how about context is essentially a they</text><text start="1257.72" dur="6.6">they are a policy mechanism that allows</text><text start="1260.299" dur="6.961">you to create a type of property that we</text><text start="1264.32" dur="6.3">that were not familiar with necessarily</text><text start="1267.26" dur="6.659">we have I think private property that is</text><text start="1270.62" dur="6.299">is based on private property law so you</text><text start="1273.919" dur="5.161">know like people cannot uh takes takes</text><text start="1276.919" dur="5.341">things from you once you acquire them</text><text start="1279.08" dur="6.599">you don&apos;t you don&apos;t don&apos;t need to like</text><text

dur="4.56">kind of like pushed into launching a</text><text start="1470.78" dur="3.0">token you know people were like yeah now</text><text start="1472.64" dur="4.2">you know now it&apos;s the time to like</text><text start="1473.78" dur="5.399">launch a token and so on yeah and uh for</text><text start="1476.84" dur="4.5">me that always felt a bit like Reckless</text><text start="1479.179" dur="4.98">I you I think you also had a tweet where</text><text start="1481.34" dur="6.54">you said uh you know the I think cost of</text><text start="1484.159" dur="5.821">deploying an erc20 is like 20 but legal</text><text start="1487.88" dur="4.32">costs are like 200 000 or whatever right</text><text start="1489.98" dur="5.46">yeah so that&apos;s familiar</text><text start="1492.2" dur="5.339">that that just felt like so reckless to</text><text start="1495.44" dur="3.599">me like that or like also it felt like</text><text start="1497.539" dur="4.981">it doesn&apos;t just didn&apos;t feel right</text><text start="1499.039" dur="5.401">somehow and so basically I I said to</text><text start="1502.52" dur="3.779">myself you know with this project I was</text><text start="1504.44" dur="4.32">like okay maybe I mean I don&apos;t want to</text><text start="1506.299" dur="4.86">take all of this like unknown unknown</text><text start="1508.76" dur="4.799">legal risk

don&apos;t know we can go into that later</text><text start="1522.799" dur="5.88">but essentially like I was in this uh</text><text start="1525.5" dur="5.1">basically I I limited my Solutions base</text><text start="1528.679" dur="3.421">and I said okay if I cannot do tokens</text><text start="1530.6" dur="3.48">then we&apos;re like in crypto and you know</text><text start="1532.1" dur="3.84">there&apos;s like this bull market which is</text><text start="1534.08" dur="4.32">when this uh post was written and I was</text><text start="1535.94" dur="5.28">like what else can I do

dur="4.98">also you know if you you know if you if</text><text start="1545.84" dur="4.02">it&apos;s like some people in in their</text><text start="1548.0" dur="4.559">protocols they put like fees

uh you know if you</text><text start="1563.299" dur="4.461">put that into the the protocol code but</text><text start="1566.24" dur="3.96">um</text><text start="1567.76" dur="4.779">you know and it&apos;s all good and well but</text><text start="1570.2" dur="4.68">the the I think the the dynamic of the</text><text start="1572.539" dur="4.561">space is that it&apos;s a it&apos;s usually a

dur="4.679">really the conclusion I think of that</text><text start="1755.48" dur="6.36">blog post is that if we can find like</text><text start="1758.659" dur="5.041">digital properties that we

start="2079.419" dur="5.641">Bond around January and then I I got</text><text start="2083.5" dur="3.899">really inspired but then I was also</text><text start="2085.06" dur="5.22">reading at the same time like this book</text><text start="2087.399" dur="5.401">by Glenn whale on radical markets and so</text><text start="2090.28" dur="5.339">on and and I ended up going to if Denver</text><text start="2092.8" dur="4.92">I also saw you speak on stage and so on</text><text start="2095.619" dur="4.461">and I think it actually was you that was</text><text start="2097.72" dur="4.379">mentioning uh this idea of</text><text start="2100.08" dur="4.259">non-scheuomorphic property and it really</text><text start="2102.099" dur="4.561">hit me it was like yeah we don&apos;t</text><text start="2104.339" dur="4.721">necessarily need to build in the digital</text><text start="2106.66" dur="4.8">realm something that is either you know</text><text start="2109.06" dur="4.08">a public good or private good we can</text><text start="2111.46" dur="3.26">also build like something complete</text><text start="2113.14" dur="4.08">wildly</text><text start="2114.72" dur="5.2">non-scheuomorphic in the sense that no</text><text start="2117.22" dur="4.619">it&apos;s not imitating anything that you</text><text start="2119.92" dur="4.38">know already exists like</text><text start="2121.839" dur="4.74">uh like like for example and for like</text><text start="2124.3" dur="4.62">just to understand like skeuomorphism is</text><text start="2126.579" dur="4.081">this idea that yeah you you basically</text><text start="2128.92" dur="3.419">you&apos;re building like this yeah almost</text><text start="2130.66" dur="3.72">like a visual bridge between something</text><text start="2132.339" dur="5.041">that exists and something new so like</text><text start="2134.38" dur="5.58">for example I think the the iPhones uh</text><text start="2137.38" dur="5.1">Notes app was always looking like it had</text><text start="2139.96" dur="4.32">like textures as as backgrounds that</text><text start="2142.48" dur="2.82">were similar to paper and then it also</text><text start="2144.28" dur="3.0">looked like you were like really</text><text start="2145.3" dur="4.14">scribbling and so that was like a</text><text start="2147.28" dur="5.04">classical skeuomorphic uh application</text><text start="2149.44" dur="4.98">compared to I think nowadays notes I</text><text start="2152.32" dur="5.22">think it&apos;s like more non-scheomorphic</text><text start="2154.42" dur="5.52">like tries to like under like tries to</text><text start="2157.54" dur="4.5">experiment with the with like what was</text><text start="2159.94" dur="4.02">possible in digital and so let me just</text><text start="2162.04" dur="3.96">gonna be my run down on skimorphism is</text><text start="2163.96" dur="4.08">like the old resembles the new so like</text><text start="2166.0" dur="4.68">my favorite example of this is uh Yahoo</text><text start="2168.04" dur="3.96">and Google both had the goal of uh</text><text start="2170.68" dur="3.84">organizing the world&apos;s information but</text><text start="2172.0" dur="3.96">Yahoo Yahoo took the card catalog system</text><text start="2174.52" dur="2.7">and put it on the internet so you had to</text><text start="2175.96" dur="2.58">like browse the directory in order to</text><text start="2177.22" dur="2.94">find your information whereas yacht</text><text start="2178.54" dur="3.84">whereas with Google I could just type in</text><text start="2180.16" dur="4.679">a search term and and find find that</text><text start="2182.38" dur="5.04">information and so by enabling The</text><text start="2184.839" dur="4.921">Primitives of the new to create new</text><text start="2187.42" dur="3.419">things non-scheomorphic things then</text><text start="2189.76" dur="2.94">we&apos;re actually able to build more</text><text start="2190.839" dur="3.0">powerful software systems so that&apos;s just</text><text start="2192.7" dur="2.04">while we&apos;re getting into keyboard</text><text start="2193.839" dur="3.601">physical I just want to make sure that</text><text start="2194.74" dur="4.74">the audience had two definitions for it</text><text start="2197.44" dur="4.8">um but but please continue</text><text start="2199.48" dur="4.56">yeah and so so anyway so like I think</text><text start="2202.24" dur="3.599">during shelling point it must have been</text><text start="2204.04" dur="4.26">or if then well I think anyways it hit</text><text start="2205.839" dur="4.621">me was like just so interesting you know</text><text start="2208.3" dur="4.319">that we are now talking about Soul bound</text><text start="2210.46" dur="5.28">property essentially where this is</text><text start="2212.619" dur="5.22">somewhat of a like you know I I guess a</text><text start="2215.74" dur="4.44">World of Warcraft player ex-world of</text><text start="2217.839" dur="5.641">Warcraft player myself I was like you</text><text start="2220.18" dur="6.179">know because you so basically a soul</text><text start="2223.48" dur="4.92">bound icon and soul bound item in World</text><text start="2226.359" dur="4.381">of Warcraft was one that you would uh</text><text start="2228.4" dur="6.0">obtain from let&apos;s say slaying a dragon</text><text start="2230.74" dur="5.04">with like a faulty person uh a raid and</text><text start="2234.4" dur="3.48">you know you had like to do all of this</text><text start="2235.78" dur="3.6">preparation and everything and then in</text><text start="2237.88" dur="4.92">the end I think there was like a</text><text start="2239.38" dur="6.18">mechanism to allocate the the item items</text><text start="2242.8" dur="6.12">that the the dragon uh dropped and then</text><text start="2245.56" dur="5.7">I think the the idea really was that</text><text start="2248.92" dur="5.64">you know you don&apos;t want to enable this</text><text start="2251.26" dur="5.64">uh pay to pay to win kind of uh system</text><text start="2254.56" dur="4.74">where someone slays a dragon with 40</text><text start="2256.9" dur="5.64">people and you know gets this super cool</text><text start="2259.3" dur="4.98">uh sword as a as a loot and and then</text><text start="2262.54" dur="3.24">sells it on an auction house for like</text><text start="2264.28" dur="3.36">1000 gold</text><text start="2265.78" dur="4.38">and then you know like this person that</text><text start="2267.64" dur="5.52">was never in in that raid like the all</text><text start="2270.16" dur="5.16">this like social uh social and</text><text start="2273.16" dur="4.02">coordinational work to to you know helps</text><text start="2275.32" dur="3.42">later dragon can just like buy that</text><text start="2277.18" dur="3.659">assault on the auction house and like</text><text start="2278.74" dur="5.099">show it basically you know equip it and</text><text start="2280.839" dur="5.401">show like oh look I I slayed the dragon</text><text start="2283.839" dur="4.5">or whatever so I think like so so</text><text start="2286.24" dur="4.68">basically sold one tokens was is like</text><text start="2288.339" dur="5.28">Soul bound items was really a way to to</text><text start="2290.92" dur="3.96">prevent it where you make uh items</text><text start="2293.619" dur="3.841">essentially</text><text start="2294.88" dur="4.68">non-final like the non-financial in a</text><text start="2297.46" dur="4.619">way that people cannot put like a</text><text start="2299.56" dur="4.32">numerical price on on the item itself</text><text start="2302.079" dur="4.561">and so I found that fascinating because</text><text start="2303.88" dur="5.16">I I was like this is genuinely something</text><text start="2306.64" dur="5.699">I&apos;ve never seen in the real world and</text><text start="2309.04" dur="4.799">and with talking to people uh at if</text><text start="2312.339" dur="3.901">Denver but also talking about like</text><text start="2313.839" dur="4.981">harburg or Texas and harbor property I</text><text start="2316.24" dur="5.46">saw somewhat like of a I saw like a</text><text start="2318.82" dur="4.32">similar problem where you know</text><text start="2321.7" dur="5.28">um</text><text start="2323.14" dur="6.24">where if if you have a a hamburger a</text><text start="2326.98" dur="5.52">hamburger property then they are also</text><text start="2329.38" dur="5.699">then also it starts to um you need to</text><text start="2332.5" dur="5.52">build like a differentiation between you</text><text start="2335.079" dur="6.181">know who is the the actual owner of the</text><text start="2338.02" dur="5.579">harburger property and who is uh just a</text><text start="2341.26" dur="4.079">processor let&apos;s say right and so you I</text><text start="2343.599" dur="4.141">think conceptually you can think of this</text><text start="2345.339" dur="5.641">where you know ownership is like this</text><text start="2347.74" dur="6.48">set of all the rides that are giving</text><text start="2350.98" dur="5.7">given to you over like an object and</text><text start="2354.22" dur="4.56">then you know from this like bucket of</text><text start="2356.68" dur="4.38">Rights you can basically pick the you</text><text start="2358.78" dur="5.1">know more individual items like you can</text><text start="2361.06" dur="4.559">say you know there&apos;s a right of me you</text><text start="2363.88" dur="3.66">know being able to use an object or</text><text start="2365.619" dur="4.261">there&apos;s a right of me being able to</text><text start="2367.54" dur="4.14">destroy an object or to you know lend it</text><text start="2369.88" dur="3.42">out to someone</text><text start="2371.68" dur="4.5">um and</text><text start="2373.3" dur="4.86">and so and so I think like Soul Bond</text><text start="2376.18" dur="4.38">tokens at the time and and halberger</text><text start="2378.16" dur="4.56">property had this sweet spot where</text><text start="2380.56" dur="5.1">fundamentally the harburger property</text><text start="2382.72" dur="6.72">should should not be transferable</text><text start="2385.66" dur="5.76">ever from the owner but only the the</text><text start="2389.44" dur="4.2">user ship should be able to change and</text><text start="2391.42" dur="4.14">so basically I was I don&apos;t know I was</text><text start="2393.64" dur="4.199">like really diving I think very deep</text><text start="2395.56" dur="4.32">into like this realm and I was writing</text><text start="2397.839" dur="4.02">all of these blog posts about it and I</text><text start="2399.88" dur="5.1">ended up concluding that it must be</text><text start="2401.859" dur="6.421">where you know uh when when I&apos;m able to</text><text start="2404.98" dur="5.52">specify how a Sol Bond token looks like</text><text start="2408.28" dur="5.579">then I&apos;m also able to build a harbor</text><text start="2410.5" dur="5.28">attacks property which I I think today</text><text start="2413.859" dur="2.881">maybe I&apos;m I&apos;m not that much of a</text><text start="2415.78" dur="3.72">Believer</text><text start="2416.74" dur="6.9">um in in that anymore but it anyways led</text><text start="2419.5" dur="5.94">me to uh to to build uh solventor and</text><text start="2423.64" dur="4.74">maybe just to give you a rundown of what</text><text start="2425.44" dur="4.74">sober and tokens are so uh I think if</text><text start="2428.38" dur="4.62">you ask 10 people you probably get 10</text><text start="2430.18" dur="5.58">answers but I think the most uh the most</text><text start="2433.0" dur="5.4">uh prominent answer is probably that of</text><text start="2435.76" dur="4.68">whatever is written in the decentralized</text><text start="2438.4" dur="2.78">society paper so</text><text start="2440.44" dur="3.06">um</text><text start="2441.18" dur="6.58">essentially they they&apos;re they&apos;re almost</text><text start="2443.5" dur="7.98">like a a way of encoding um claims</text><text start="2447.76" dur="5.819">uh into in into a data structure and</text><text start="2451.48" dur="5.34">then you know assigning these claims and</text><text start="2453.579" dur="5.341">and Publishing them uh selectively</text><text start="2456.82" dur="4.98">um I also think but I also think you can</text><text start="2458.92" dur="4.56">frame Solomon tokens as kind of this uh</text><text start="2461.8" dur="3.96">yeah like a different kind of property</text><text start="2463.48" dur="5.76">class so then they don&apos;t necessarily</text><text start="2465.76" dur="6.24">have to be uh to be claims</text><text start="2469.24" dur="5.76">um and then I think the maybe the more</text><text start="2472.0" dur="5.4">the most tangible uh framing for</text><text start="2475.0" dur="4.859">developers at least is one where you say</text><text start="2477.4" dur="4.38">you know a sold one token the most</text><text start="2479.859" dur="4.141">simple Solomon token is just a</text><text start="2481.78" dur="5.819">non-transferable token so like an nft</text><text start="2484.0" dur="6.72">for example where uh you can you know</text><text start="2487.599" dur="5.461">once it like it it it&apos;s</text><text start="2490.72" dur="4.44">um sent to your account you can</text><text start="2493.06" dur="4.38">essentially</text><text start="2495.16" dur="5.34">um you can essentially never never send</text><text start="2497.44" dur="6.12">it back and I think the name the name</text><text start="2500.5" dur="5.7">then uh start starts to originate a bit</text><text start="2503.56" dur="5.64">more from this idea of</text><text start="2506.2" dur="7.26">uh you know like Soul binding something</text><text start="2509.2" dur="6.659">to to you where similar to how how it</text><text start="2513.46" dur="4.98">works in World of Warcraft you are</text><text start="2515.859" dur="4.98">um you&apos;re giving something to a certain</text><text start="2518.44" dur="4.44">account and the the intention is that</text><text start="2520.839" dur="4.681">there is that there cannot be a</text><text start="2522.88" dur="5.239">financial uh a price attached to it</text><text start="2525.52" dur="6.36">because it&apos;s fundamentally non-tradable</text><text start="2528.119" dur="7.781">uh with at least the the usual uh ways</text><text start="2531.88" dur="7.62">we trade uh things on web3</text><text start="2535.9" dur="5.219">I will link the soul bound paper in the</text><text start="2539.5" dur="4.619">show notes right here so that people can</text><text start="2541.119" dur="5.101">read it but basically uh the soul bound</text><text start="2544.119" dur="4.681">toker the paper is called decentralized</text><text start="2546.22" dur="5.58">society and it&apos;s all about what if</text><text start="2548.8" dur="5.819">there&apos;s this deep interconnected web of</text><text start="2551.8" dur="5.7">attestations you know Kevin attests that</text><text start="2554.619" dur="6.361">Tim is a great podcast guest and you</text><text start="2557.5" dur="5.099">would test out that uh other authors in</text><text start="2560.98" dur="4.56">the ethereum ecosystem have done</text><text start="2562.599" dur="5.181">important things and so on and so forth</text><text start="2565.54" dur="5.76">and you create this sort of web of trust</text><text start="2567.78" dur="5.38">of of these this directional attestation</text><text start="2571.3" dur="3.36">graph and I almost think of it as like</text><text start="2573.16" dur="3.36">page rank where websites that link to</text><text start="2574.66" dur="3.84">each other are kind of voting for each</text><text start="2576.52" dur="4.02">other&apos;s legitimacy when you send Soul</text><text start="2578.5" dur="3.72">bound tokens with attached metadata</text><text start="2580.54" dur="3.84">you&apos;re making vouches about each other</text><text start="2582.22" dur="3.96">and the sum of this the Gestalt of all</text><text start="2584.38" dur="3.9">these things is we have reputation that</text><text start="2586.18" dur="3.24">we can begin to I don&apos;t know solve civil</text><text start="2588.28" dur="3.78">resistance or provide under</text><text start="2589.42" dur="4.919">collateralized loan using the densely</text><text start="2592.06" dur="3.9">networked part of the information and</text><text start="2594.339" dur="4.5">that becomes really exciting to me</text><text start="2595.96" dur="4.32">because once we have the network effects</text><text start="2598.839" dur="2.941">of this spinning where more people are</text><text start="2600.28" dur="3.18">getting soul-bound tokens or other</text><text start="2601.78" dur="3.36">identity markers it could be dids could</text><text start="2603.46" dur="3.72">be things that are off chain then more</text><text start="2605.14" dur="3.42">people will try to consume those dids</text><text start="2607.18" dur="3.06">because they&apos;re getting more utility out</text><text start="2608.56" dur="4.92">of them so that&apos;s what&apos;s really exciting</text><text start="2610.24" dur="5.579">to me about decentralized society and I</text><text start="2613.48" dur="4.2">feel like Soul bound tokens are just a</text><text start="2615.819" dur="3.601">means to that end</text><text start="2617.68" dur="4.02">um and there&apos;s some maybe some troubles</text><text start="2619.42" dur="4.8">Troublesome privacy things with only</text><text start="2621.7" dur="4.08">going all in on soulbound tokens</text><text start="2624.22" dur="3.359">um but but that&apos;s what&apos;s exciting to me</text><text start="2625.78" dur="4.26">about Soul bound tokens I&apos;m curious what</text><text start="2627.579" dur="5.401">about that resonates with you</text><text start="2630.04" dur="5.64">yeah yeah I think you touched on uh I</text><text start="2632.98" dur="5.28">think one of the most fundamental points</text><text start="2635.68" dur="5.22">of the concept when you mentioned</text><text start="2638.26" dur="4.2">privacy and that um that that this is</text><text start="2640.9" dur="3.84">like such a</text><text start="2642.46" dur="5.159">I think a such a challenge such a</text><text start="2644.74" dur="5.28">challenge to that that still like needs</text><text start="2647.619" dur="6.48">proper addressing in the entire</text><text start="2650.02" dur="7.4">um in the entire concept where uh I</text><text start="2654.099" dur="6.26">think people in general are very</text><text start="2657.42" dur="6.52">overwhelmed with the idea of</text><text start="2660.359" dur="6.581">sending and storing data on blockchains</text><text start="2663.94" dur="6.419">and you know I think the norm so far has</text><text start="2666.94" dur="7.139">been that you know we voluntarily upload</text><text start="2670.359" dur="5.341">data to the internet and so there&apos;s like</text><text start="2674.079" dur="3.54">a good chance that somehow you can</text><text start="2675.7" dur="4.86">always delete that data by just</text><text start="2677.619" dur="4.921">following through uh you know like you</text><text start="2680.56" dur="3.6">look at the domain name and you find out</text><text start="2682.54" dur="3.36">who&apos;s responsible for hosting that</text><text start="2684.16" dur="3.72">server and then you I don&apos;t know there&apos;s</text><text start="2685.9" dur="3.6">like a legal recourse that you can do</text><text start="2687.88" dur="3.18">and whatever so you always end up being</text><text start="2689.5" dur="4.74">taking like being able to take down</text><text start="2691.06" dur="5.82">stuff right I think in in the EU where I</text><text start="2694.24" dur="4.5">live there&apos;s even a like the right to be</text><text start="2696.88" dur="3.66">forgotten which which is essentially</text><text start="2698.74" dur="5.94">like a right you can use as an</text><text start="2700.54" dur="4.799">individual to remove like uh negative</text><text start="2704.68" dur="3.3">um</text><text start="2705.339" dur="4.02">uh like claims about you from for</text><text start="2707.98" dur="4.26">example like the Google search results</text><text start="2709.359" dur="5.641">and stuff like this and I think</text><text start="2712.24" dur="4.92">uh with with blockchains and this is not</text><text start="2715.0" dur="4.26">I think this is not specific to solvent</text><text start="2717.16" dur="4.38">tokens but it&apos;s it&apos;s generally true for</text><text start="2719.26" dur="4.92">for a blockchain that keeps all the data</text><text start="2721.54" dur="4.92">available permanently is that um that</text><text start="2724.18" dur="5.46">people are now kind of finding out by</text><text start="2726.46" dur="4.26">when we&apos;re talking about a tested claims</text><text start="2729.64" dur="4.08">they&apos;re like</text><text start="2730.72" dur="5.7">damn this can have like actual really</text><text start="2733.72" dur="5.94">bad implications too where like how how</text><text start="2736.42" dur="5.64">am I able to you know remove a piece of</text><text start="2739.66" dur="3.3">information that I I might not want to</text><text start="2742.06" dur="3.72">have</text><text start="2742.96" dur="5.1">um uh on chain and so and so I think</text><text start="2745.78" dur="5.52">it&apos;s useful in this case</text><text start="2748.06" dur="5.64">um to think of privacy as a contextual</text><text start="2751.3" dur="5.4">integrity and I&apos;m I&apos;m not really making</text><text start="2753.7" dur="5.28">this up but this is a like a research</text><text start="2756.7" dur="4.159">paper from uh Helen nissenbaum which is</text><text start="2758.98" dur="6.839">I think quite renowned in the space</text><text start="2760.859" dur="7.121">where basically the I I I&apos;m gonna uh I&apos;m</text><text start="2765.819" dur="3.961">gonna Slaughter I think the the concept</text><text start="2767.98" dur="4.5">but I&apos;m anyways gonna say it like here</text><text start="2769.78" dur="5.7">quickly which is where the contextual</text><text start="2772.48" dur="6.42">Integrity in in a in in a context in a</text><text start="2775.48" dur="4.339">situation is that where the uh</text><text start="2778.9" dur="3.06">information</text><text start="2779.819" dur="2.8">disclosure actually</text><text start="2781.96" dur="4.2">um</text><text start="2782.619" dur="4.98">uh has like an interactive uh component</text><text start="2786.16" dur="4.32">with what you&apos;re trying to achieve so</text><text start="2787.599" dur="5.461">let&apos;s say if I go to the doctor</text><text start="2790.48" dur="4.8">um and I tell the doctor that my foot is</text><text start="2793.06" dur="4.5">hurting then I&apos;m sharing this</text><text start="2795.28" dur="4.5">information within the in the context</text><text start="2797.56" dur="3.779">and with the Integrity assumption that</text><text start="2799.78" dur="3.18">you know the doctor will use this</text><text start="2801.339" dur="3.601">information that my food is felting to</text><text start="2802.96" dur="4.2">treat the food and that I end up not</text><text start="2804.94" dur="4.44">having a hurting food now I think</text><text start="2807.16" dur="4.86">there&apos;s there&apos;s like</text><text start="2809.38" dur="5.04">like two things where where these uh</text><text start="2812.02" dur="5.04">things can go wrong one is when the this</text><text start="2814.42" dur="5.399">information then uh you know starts</text><text start="2817.06" dur="5.16">leaking outside so for example if the</text><text start="2819.819" dur="5.52">doctor then tells you know their partner</text><text start="2822.22" dur="5.82">that I ended up having a uh hurting foot</text><text start="2825.339" dur="5.701">right then then I think the the</text><text start="2828.04" dur="4.86">contextual Integrity of you know why I</text><text start="2831.04" dur="5.22">told that doctor that my food was</text><text start="2832.9" dur="5.64">hurting is broken and then uh the the</text><text start="2836.26" dur="5.7">other uh Dimension is where the doctor</text><text start="2838.54" dur="6.84">would use uh that information for like a</text><text start="2841.96" dur="5.159">different uh course than just uh uh you</text><text start="2845.38" dur="4.08">know like treating the the illness of my</text><text start="2847.119" dur="6.181">food that we call so like we basically</text><text start="2849.46" dur="7.619">call that uh the appropriateness and so</text><text start="2853.3" dur="5.7">so I think viewing privacy as contextual</text><text start="2857.079" dur="4.981">Integrity is very useful because at</text><text start="2859.0" dur="5.839">least as an engineer it allows us to</text><text start="2862.06" dur="5.22">make like uh like pretty straightforward</text><text start="2864.839" dur="4.181">judgments on you know things that we we</text><text start="2867.28" dur="4.86">should do and we shouldn&apos;t do in terms</text><text start="2869.02" dur="5.04">of implementation and I think with uh</text><text start="2872.14" dur="3.66">the the now the challenging part I think</text><text start="2874.06" dur="4.62">with soul bound tokens or anyways being</text><text start="2875.8" dur="6.0">exposed to this idea that there might be</text><text start="2878.68" dur="5.76">you know cases where we where things are</text><text start="2881.8" dur="4.68">never reversible where once we publish</text><text start="2884.44" dur="3.419">them they will permanently be out there</text><text start="2886.48" dur="3.96">because the blockchain keeps them around</text><text start="2887.859" dur="4.201">this becomes challenging because it&apos;s</text><text start="2890.44" dur="4.5">something that we&apos;ve never had to deal</text><text start="2892.06" dur="5.46">with I think before and so and so like</text><text start="2894.94" dur="5.34">for example like I personally with being</text><text start="2897.52" dur="5.76">a an EIP author like I&apos;m</text><text start="2900.28" dur="5.46">at least for now I think I would like</text><text start="2903.28" dur="6.6">push back for example on vitalik&apos;s idea</text><text start="2905.74" dur="7.44">of this uh negative reputation uh red</text><text start="2909.88" dur="5.76">registry even if you can make it uh you</text><text start="2913.18" dur="5.58">know I think like there I think like how</text><text start="2915.64" dur="5.219">italic Transit is almost like in a in a</text><text start="2918.76" dur="4.98">utopic case where you know all of this</text><text start="2920.859" dur="5.581">zero knowledge math and so on works out</text><text start="2923.74" dur="5.339">perfectly and I think in that in that</text><text start="2926.44" dur="4.679">scenario I think uh uh you know the the</text><text start="2929.079" dur="4.26">suggestion of negative reputation is</text><text start="2931.119" dur="4.381">actually not a bad one but I think the</text><text start="2933.339" dur="5.881">in order to get there I think it will</text><text start="2935.5" dur="5.28">take much longer than we we that that we</text><text start="2939.22" dur="4.26">probably have time to actually figure</text><text start="2940.78" dur="6.18">out the the the the Privacy implications</text><text start="2943.48" dur="6.42">and so like being you know um the EIP</text><text start="2946.96" dur="5.159">author of these things I I don&apos;t see</text><text start="2949.9" dur="4.5">myself confronted with the technical</text><text start="2952.119" dur="4.5">intricacies of zero knowledge proofs for</text><text start="2954.4" dur="4.56">me it&apos;s more a challenge of like telling</text><text start="2956.619" dur="4.561">people hey you know be your Please be</text><text start="2958.96" dur="5.159">aware of not putting like sensitive</text><text start="2961.18" dur="6.24">information on chain and um you know</text><text start="2964.119" dur="6.24">like try everything possible to not uh</text><text start="2967.42" dur="4.98">yeah League like like metadata and stuff</text><text start="2970.359" dur="4.26">like this I think</text><text start="2972.4" dur="4.02">um yeah I mean I think that there&apos;s</text><text start="2974.619" dur="4.261">definitely some problematic things there</text><text start="2976.42" dur="3.659">and you know this isn&apos;t like a web 2 app</text><text start="2978.88" dur="4.62">where if we make a mistake we can just</text><text start="2980.079" dur="6.181">roll it back and so it Bears a lot of</text><text start="2983.5" dur="5.04">the need to be judicious as we move</text><text start="2986.26" dur="3.839">forward on these things</text><text start="2988.54" dur="3.36">um you know and I&apos;m curious we only have</text><text start="2990.099" dur="3.361">we only have about five minutes left of</text><text start="2991.9" dur="2.88">the things that we&apos;ve discussed what are</text><text start="2993.46" dur="3.02">you excited about when it comes to</text><text start="2994.78" dur="3.539">funding the commons or creating</text><text start="2996.48" dur="3.28">non-scheomorphic applications with</text><text start="2998.319" dur="2.76">blockchains that you think are really</text><text start="2999.76" dur="3.18">compelling I mean you&apos;ve kind of got</text><text start="3001.079" dur="3.601">this breadth of the design space What</text><text start="3002.94" dur="4.5">are you really excited about</text><text start="3004.68" dur="5.399">yeah I think</text><text start="3007.44" dur="4.98">I mean this is a</text><text start="3010.079" dur="4.801">not an easy point to make but I think</text><text start="3012.42" dur="5.659">I&apos;m the most foolish I think in general</text><text start="3014.88" dur="6.239">on the blockchain space I am because</text><text start="3018.079" dur="4.961">essentially it&apos;s a it&apos;s it&apos;s almost like</text><text start="3021.119" dur="3.841">a Sandbox environment where we are</text><text start="3023.04" dur="3.42">experimenting with</text><text start="3024.96" dur="3.78">where we are experimenting with</text><text start="3026.46" dur="4.32">mechanism design and with economics and</text><text start="3028.74" dur="3.96">you know now we have even like this</text><text start="3030.78" dur="5.76">almost like this research and</text><text start="3032.7" dur="6.899">development uh Labs like uh like like</text><text start="3036.54" dur="5.52">you know a radical exchange and uh the</text><text start="3039.599" dur="3.661">uh what&apos;s the other one comments stack</text><text start="3042.06" dur="3.48">and so on that you know they&apos;re like</text><text start="3043.26" dur="4.859">producing this new type of mechanism</text><text start="3045.54" dur="4.86">design so it&apos;s like a mix it&apos;s not only</text><text start="3048.119" dur="5.041">academic research anymore that publishes</text><text start="3050.4" dur="4.5">books uh books and papers but we&apos;re also</text><text start="3053.16" dur="4.56">implementing these things right in in</text><text start="3054.9" dur="5.159">like uh real scenarios with real money</text><text start="3057.72" dur="5.82">and we&apos;re like will basically finding</text><text start="3060.059" dur="5.481">out if these things work so I think I&apos;m</text><text start="3063.54" dur="6.36">I&apos;m really</text><text start="3065.54" dur="7.299">optimistic in the sense that we can test</text><text start="3069.9" dur="5.4">some of these new mechanisms out and we</text><text start="3072.839" dur="5.701">can we can innovate and we can we can</text><text start="3075.3" dur="6.66">find data in in yeah like just in the</text><text start="3078.54" dur="5.22">sandbox environment and then still uh we</text><text start="3081.96" dur="4.98">can apply them to the real world</text><text start="3083.76" dur="5.52">eventually and I think one of the uh one</text><text start="3086.94" dur="5.22">of the examples that I I would like to</text><text start="3089.28" dur="5.16">make here is is that of the energy Grid</text><text start="3092.16" dur="5.459">in Germany right now that is under heavy</text><text start="3094.44" dur="6.179">pressure from the you know from from the</text><text start="3097.619" dur="4.041">Russian government that stopped the the</text><text start="3100.619" dur="4.2">gas</text><text start="3101.66" dur="6.04">exports via the north stream pipelines</text><text start="3104.819" dur="5.581">where you know you need to hold a</text><text start="3107.7" dur="7.08">certain uh voltage within the the grid</text><text start="3110.4" dur="6.06">right and therefore the pricing of the</text><text start="3114.78" dur="4.76">utility providers of the electricity</text><text start="3116.46" dur="7.619">actually is by whoever</text><text start="3119.54" dur="6.94">uh provides the the highest price per</text><text start="3124.079" dur="5.161">kilowatt kilowatt hour it sounds a bit</text><text start="3126.48" dur="5.579">Yeah unintuitive but given that you</text><text start="3129.24" dur="4.859">always need to hold the the voltage of</text><text start="3132.059" dur="5.28">the of the grid this is what you have to</text><text start="3134.099" dur="6.841">have to do and so fascinatingly we have</text><text start="3137.339" dur="5.821">a uh a a mayor in the south of Germany</text><text start="3140.94" dur="4.139">that you know their Community has</text><text start="3143.16" dur="5.64">heavily invested in renewable energies</text><text start="3145.079" dur="5.28">and he he goes on television uh talk</text><text start="3148.8" dur="4.38">shows and he says you know we&apos;re making</text><text start="3150.359" dur="5.22">a killing with our uh wind and solar</text><text start="3153.18" dur="4.98">energy because the price of Solar and</text><text start="3155.579" dur="4.801">wind I mean we we have invested in these</text><text start="3158.16" dur="4.08">uh yeah you know in these like windmills</text><text start="3160.38" dur="3.479">and so on but we&apos;re not paying more like</text><text start="3162.24" dur="5.579">everyone else is paying more by</text><text start="3163.859" dur="6.24">producing uh electricity with gas and so</text><text start="3167.819" dur="5.941">I think this points to to a problem</text><text start="3170.099" dur="7.02">where this uh Energy Mix that we&apos;re</text><text start="3173.76" dur="6.18">we&apos;re having in uh Germany that although</text><text start="3177.119" dur="6.121">it&apos;s uh you know it&apos;s um it&apos;s</text><text start="3179.94" dur="5.399">Diversified uh we will we always have to</text><text start="3183.24" dur="3.96">pay the highest uh the highest</text><text start="3185.339" dur="4.561">production price</text><text start="3187.2" dur="4.919">um is kind of like puts it puts us into</text><text start="3189.9" dur="5.28">this absurd position where you know the</text><text start="3192.119" dur="5.341">the people that uh that that that</text><text start="3195.18" dur="4.02">produce green green energy make make</text><text start="3197.46" dur="3.359">basically the most amount of money even</text><text start="3199.2" dur="4.8">though they&apos;re not really contributing</text><text start="3200.819" dur="6.181">the most uh significant amount uh into</text><text start="3204.0" dur="6.3">the grid and so and now how do I get</text><text start="3207.0" dur="6.0">back to this with blockchain I think the</text><text start="3210.3" dur="6.72">block production mechanism in ethereum</text><text start="3213.0" dur="8.099">is actually very similar to that of uh</text><text start="3217.02" dur="6.0">the energy grid where uh similar to how</text><text start="3221.099" dur="4.201">in the Energy Group we have to keep the</text><text start="3223.02" dur="4.68">voltage at all costs because otherwise</text><text start="3225.3" dur="5.1">it means we would get a blackout also in</text><text start="3227.7" dur="4.859">ethereum uh in the ethereum consensus</text><text start="3230.4" dur="4.56">algorithm we also have to continuously</text><text start="3232.559" dur="4.8">come up with new blocks so essentially</text><text start="3234.96" dur="5.639">we are also having a similar problem</text><text start="3237.359" dur="5.821">where those that Supply the block</text><text start="3240.599" dur="5.76">production have a really a lot of power</text><text start="3243.18" dur="4.98">in you know adjusting like making the</text><text start="3246.359" dur="6.5">prices adjust and making them Skyrocket</text><text start="3248.16" dur="8.82">and so with I think I think with EIP 15</text><text start="3252.859" dur="6.22">59 we uh now we are for example</text><text start="3256.98" dur="4.02">experimenting with a mechanism that I</text><text start="3259.079" dur="4.201">think went from all the way from the</text><text start="3261.0" dur="4.079">engineering to like I think people in</text><text start="3263.28" dur="4.02">the in the economic space you know</text><text start="3265.079" dur="5.221">review reviewing this proposal and so on</text><text start="3267.3" dur="4.799">into like an implementation every and</text><text start="3270.3" dur="5.16">now suddenly we can see that you know we</text><text start="3272.099" dur="5.701">went from a a like a pricing mechanism</text><text start="3275.46" dur="4.379">for Block storage that was that had like</text><text start="3277.8" dur="5.88">a very variable</text><text start="3279.839" dur="7.201">um uh rate of pricing over time up to</text><text start="3283.68" dur="5.639">like a a algorithm that ends up being</text><text start="3287.04" dur="5.46">not variable at all but in terms of</text><text start="3289.319" dur="5.821">spikes is uh always course correcting to</text><text start="3292.5" dur="6.66">the mean because basically as soon as we</text><text start="3295.14" dur="6.06">go over the normal demand instead of</text><text start="3299.16" dur="4.32">encouraging actually</text><text start="3301.2" dur="3.48">um more Supply through uh through</text><text start="3303.48" dur="4.079">increasing the price we&apos;re actually</text><text start="3304.68" dur="6.3">saying we&apos;re burning the uh we&apos;re</text><text start="3307.559" dur="6.3">burning the Eve that is excess that that</text><text start="3310.98" dur="5.22">we get from that we get from demand and</text><text start="3313.859" dur="4.621">so I think while these two things maybe</text><text start="3316.2" dur="3.84">they are like maybe you know it&apos;s like</text><text start="3318.48" dur="5.359">two different problems I&apos;m talking about</text><text start="3320.04" dur="5.94">I think the in in the end like the the</text><text start="3323.839" dur="3.821">economic primitive I think I have</text><text start="3325.98" dur="3.48">pointed out that they are that these two</text><text start="3327.66" dur="4.08">things are very similar and what makes</text><text start="3329.46" dur="6.3">me excited is that essentially we have</text><text start="3331.74" dur="6.9">tested out a thing that uh with EIP 15</text><text start="3335.76" dur="5.099">uh 59 you know we have tested out a</text><text start="3338.64" dur="4.86">thing in like this sandbox environment</text><text start="3340.859" dur="5.22">where you know everyone that had like</text><text start="3343.5" dur="4.559">opted into ethereum uh you know was was</text><text start="3346.079" dur="4.321">part of it but also you know if it</text><text start="3348.059" dur="4.141">hadn&apos;t worked out then potentially I</text><text start="3350.4" dur="4.56">think the consequences would have been</text><text start="3352.2" dur="4.74">uh less fatal than for example if we had</text><text start="3354.96" dur="3.54">tested this out like on the scale of a</text><text start="3356.94" dur="3.119">country where like the energy where</text><text start="3358.5" dur="3.839">we&apos;re like testing this on our live</text><text start="3360.059" dur="4.921">energy grid so I think it makes me like</text><text start="3362.339" dur="5.52">incredibly bullish that basically we</text><text start="3364.98" dur="7.26">have this giant sandbox where we can</text><text start="3367.859" dur="6.841">test economic um economic policy and</text><text start="3372.24" dur="4.8">then once we get the clean data and so</text><text start="3374.7" dur="5.58">on we can also apply this to much more</text><text start="3377.04" dur="5.94">critical uh infrastructure and you know</text><text start="3380.28" dur="4.74">this ends up uh I mean hopefully this</text><text start="3382.98" dur="4.98">ends up creating a better and more</text><text start="3385.02" dur="5.52">regenerative uh Financial system but</text><text start="3387.96" dur="4.92">also a world of like regenerative world</text><text start="3390.54" dur="4.68">yeah the way I think of is like first Do</text><text start="3392.88" dur="4.199">no harm so like we got to stop the scams</text><text start="3395.22" dur="4.74">in the ponzis and the rugs create</text><text start="3397.079" dur="4.801">mechanisms that uh where those people</text><text start="3399.96" dur="3.24">can be held accountable or at least you</text><text start="3401.88" dur="3.479">know not get the attention that they&apos;re</text><text start="3403.2" dur="4.2">sucking up all the oxygen in the room uh</text><text start="3405.359" dur="3.361">the carbon neutrality has there&apos;s been a</text><text start="3407.4" dur="2.699">lot of steps forward with that with the</text><text start="3408.72" dur="3.18">merge and now it&apos;s about building</text><text start="3410.099" dur="4.321">regenerative systems that are net</text><text start="3411.9" dur="3.84">positive and so what are the mechanisms</text><text start="3414.42" dur="2.46">for that</text><text start="3415.74" dur="2.4">um we only have a few more minutes is</text><text start="3416.88" dur="4.04">there anything I didn&apos;t ask you that</text><text start="3418.14" dur="2.78">that you want to say</text><text start="3421.619" dur="2.821">um I&apos;m not sure we talked about a lot of</text><text start="3423.66" dur="1.5">things</text><text start="3424.44" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="3425.16" dur="4.5">I&apos;m happy to be here and uh to be</text><text start="3428.16" dur="4.08">talking to you</text><text start="3429.66" dur="4.56">yeah yeah I think this is honestly the</text><text start="3432.24" dur="3.42">highest use of my talents in network is</text><text start="3434.22" dur="4.2">to try to figure this stuff out together</text><text start="3435.66" dur="4.08">so appreciate you coming on to talk</text><text start="3438.42" dur="4.08">about the work that you&apos;ve been doing</text><text start="3439.74" dur="6.06">really encourage listeners to check out</text><text start="3442.5" dur="5.96">your blog which I&apos;ve got a link to in</text><text start="3445.8"
