start="237.959" dur="5.461">nouns so WTF is public nouns</text><text start="241.5" dur="4.08">yeah what the is public nouns I</text><text start="243.42" dur="4.5">mean I feel like just like historically</text><text start="245.58" dur="5.1">is probably how it emerged probably</text><text start="247.92" dur="5.34">makes the most sense at least to me but</text><text start="250.68" dur="5.1">uh but I mean the tldr you know it is a</text><text start="253.26" dur="5.699">announce extension uh just like a fork</text><text start="255.78" dur="5.519">of nouns uh that you know aims to bend</text><text start="258.959" dur="4.981">the incentive uh away from just that</text><text start="261.299" dur="5.581">pure meme of nouns to uh supporting</text><text start="263.94" dur="4.74">public goods basically</text><text start="266.88" dur="3.9">but yeah yeah it started I&apos;d say it</text><text start="268.68" dur="5.22">started with a group of people</text><text start="270.78" dur="6.419">um these people are mostly in the public</text><text start="273.9" dur="5.94">goods related space and and uh nearby</text><text start="277.199" dur="5.821">spaces and we actually were quite</text><text start="279.84" dur="6.12">interested in nouns in general and maybe</text><text start="283.02" dur="5.6">even acquiring a noun and we started on</text><text start="285.96" dur="6.48">that on that journey and it very quickly</text><text start="288.62" dur="5.5">uh turned into getting more people from</text><text start="292.44" dur="3.6">the public good space involved in the</text><text start="294.12" dur="5.34">project and originally we were going to</text><text start="296.04" dur="7.2">like buy a noun in order to ask for</text><text start="299.46" dur="4.92">funding to create public nouns and then</text><text start="303.24" dur="2.76">we&apos;re like that doesn&apos;t really make</text><text start="304.38" dur="3.18">sense like we don&apos;t need that funding we</text><text start="306.0" dur="4.8">don&apos;t need to buy a noun to start public</text><text start="307.56" dur="5.88">nouns so we just went on the path of uh</text><text start="310.8" dur="5.1">yes just starting public nouns and and</text><text start="313.44" dur="4.8">defining it and over of course a few</text><text start="315.9" dur="4.92">months at Dao Palace and on and Discord</text><text start="318.24" dur="4.44">and telegrams we brought more people</text><text start="320.82" dur="4.74">from different projects in the public</text><text start="322.68" dur="5.88">good space and related into the group</text><text start="325.56" dur="5.639">and then we kind of organized the the</text><text start="328.56" dur="3.66">initial co-organizers who helped launch</text><text start="331.199" dur="3.72">it</text><text start="332.22" dur="4.62">um which is like seven organizations but</text><text start="334.919" dur="4.381">with a plan to bring more and more</text><text start="336.84" dur="5.04">organizations uh in over time through</text><text start="339.3" dur="5.28">like curation and as the as the as the</text><text start="341.88" dur="4.8">public nouns Dow grows to yeah to add to</text><text start="344.58" dur="4.38">that is just um it&apos;s just another</text><text start="346.68" dur="4.62">mechanism by which we can fund public</text><text start="348.96" dur="4.32">goods which is why uh it&apos;s like the</text><text start="351.3" dur="3.179">first nft project that I&apos;ve been that I</text><text start="353.28" dur="2.88">got excited about</text><text start="354.479" dur="3.841">um in a while</text><text start="356.16" dur="3.599">um so that&apos;s why I you know decided to</text><text start="358.32" dur="2.58">jump in</text><text start="359.759" dur="3.66">yeah</text><text start="360.9" dur="5.34">and this you uh you&apos;re one of the early</text><text start="363.419" dur="5.761">hodlers of of public nouns is that right</text><text start="366.24" dur="5.34">uh yeah I think I I got the first</text><text start="369.18" dur="3.9">the first one with the panvala stamp</text><text start="371.58" dur="3.179">head</text><text start="373.08" dur="3.78">so that was exciting</text><text start="374.759" dur="4.38">got it and what excited you about public</text><text start="376.86" dur="4.98">nouns as opposed to the Litany of other</text><text start="379.139" dur="4.861">nft projects out there yeah I mean like</text><text start="381.84" dur="3.96">um a final nfts in general as like</text><text start="384.0" dur="5.58">cultural artifacts</text><text start="385.8" dur="5.94">um for us to propagate memes and Brands</text><text start="389.58" dur="4.44">um so as we saw with the like the 10K</text><text start="391.74" dur="4.62">pfp boom like it&apos;s been a visceral way</text><text start="394.02" dur="4.86">for us to form a sense of like identity</text><text start="396.36" dur="3.54">and belonging as as part of a collective</text><text start="398.88" dur="3.18">um but</text><text start="399.9" dur="5.1">uh yeah like what we&apos;ve seen with those</text><text start="402.06" dur="4.68">like other sort of 10K pfp ones was that</text><text start="405.0" dur="5.28">it kind of reflects this thing in crypto</text><text start="406.74" dur="6.66">where like an opportunity to join</text><text start="410.28" dur="6.06">um to join exist in like a really narrow</text><text start="413.4" dur="4.799">uh time window where you just happen to</text><text start="416.34" dur="3.72">be a part of the ethereum crowd sale you</text><text start="418.199" dur="3.481">just happen to be a part of you know the</text><text start="420.06" dur="4.38">year and telegram group where the drop</text><text start="421.68" dur="4.68">happened or like the crypto punks meant</text><text start="424.44" dur="3.96">um so I think like the noun-ish sort of</text><text start="426.36" dur="5.76">distribution model was um an interesting</text><text start="428.4" dur="5.579">way to like perpetually fund a treasury</text><text start="432.12" dur="4.079">um and so like this infinite aspect if</text><text start="433.979" dur="4.741">it was interesting to me and then also</text><text start="436.199" dur="4.021">of course like this orientation towards</text><text start="438.72" dur="4.259">um public goods</text><text start="440.22" dur="5.28">um was a way to kind of like what what</text><text start="442.979" dur="4.321">drove me to um actually jump in as</text><text start="445.5" dur="3.479">opposed to like observing it from the</text><text start="447.3" dur="4.2">sidelines</text><text start="448.979" dur="5.34">yeah that is like why we got I think or</text><text start="451.5" dur="4.44">at least a lot of us got uh excited</text><text start="454.319" dur="3.121">about nouns in the first place really is</text><text start="455.94" dur="2.4">like the governance elements of it which</text><text start="457.44" dur="3.659">is you know which is the</text><text start="458.34" dur="4.259">self-perpetuating uh treasury that has</text><text start="461.099" dur="3.841">built-in governance in it basically like</text><text start="462.599" dur="3.6">when you participate in it uh amine</text><text start="464.94" dur="2.94">called it he was like what is this like</text><text start="466.199" dur="3.9">molecued out with nfts and I was like</text><text start="467.88" dur="4.02">yeah basically uh where you you know you</text><text start="470.099" dur="4.861">put in Ethan you get immediate power in</text><text start="471.9" dur="6.48">a dow you know so like in the nouns case</text><text start="474.96" dur="4.679">that&apos;s obviously been wildly prolific</text><text start="478.38" dur="2.819">um and here it was just kind of like</text><text start="479.639" dur="3.06">turning that into experiment of like</text><text start="481.199" dur="3.78">well can we just add this incentive of</text><text start="482.699" dur="4.141">like we&apos;re gonna do this now like Nisha</text><text start="484.979" dur="4.141">is like with this like you know ongoing</text><text start="486.84" dur="4.859">uh auction so it&apos;s like this nice</text><text start="489.12" dur="3.78">Cadence of of community growth but like</text><text start="491.699" dur="2.28">there&apos;s actually a purpose to this</text><text start="492.9" dur="3.299">community which is like to support</text><text start="493.979" dur="4.261">public goods uh however we can you know</text><text start="496.199" dur="3.78">not just with funding but</text><text start="498.24" dur="3.54">um you know I like to think that we&apos;ve</text><text start="499.979" dur="4.62">already contributed to public goods even</text><text start="501.78" dur="4.259">before the first auction was settled you</text><text start="504.599" dur="4.141">know like uh this course has already</text><text start="506.039" dur="4.44">been raised in places where you know</text><text start="508.74" dur="2.88">maybe public goods work being talked</text><text start="510.479" dur="3.3">about but they weren&apos;t being talked</text><text start="511.62" dur="4.68">about to the degree that they are now</text><text start="513.779" dur="4.801">already which is really interesting uh</text><text start="516.3" dur="4.08">and like various things like that so</text><text start="518.58" dur="4.62">um yeah it&apos;s really cool though the</text><text start="520.38" dur="5.459">governance element in funneling into the</text><text start="523.2" dur="4.74">uh the purpose of supporting public</text><text start="525.839" dur="3.481">goods once you get there is like super</text><text start="527.94" dur="4.14">cool</text><text start="529.32" dur="4.5">and one way to think about it is there</text><text start="532.08" dur="3.78">are a lot of people in the space like</text><text start="533.82" dur="3.24">and he&apos;s just mentioned but Kevin maybe</text><text start="535.86" dur="4.08">yourself</text><text start="537.06" dur="4.2">people like vitalik there&apos;s a there&apos;s a</text><text start="539.94" dur="3.72">whole bunch of people out there in our</text><text start="541.26" dur="6.06">space that obviously like public goods</text><text start="543.66" dur="5.88">and they see nfts out there but</text><text start="547.32" dur="3.3">like my personal opinion would be like I</text><text start="549.54" dur="3.66">don&apos;t think</text><text start="550.62" dur="4.02">um metallic would ever buy a noun like I</text><text start="553.2" dur="3.12">I don&apos;t mind I don&apos;t think he Minds that</text><text start="554.64" dur="4.08">they exist but like he doesn&apos;t buy a</text><text start="556.32" dur="4.32">board ape he doesn&apos;t buy a noun but if</text><text start="558.72" dur="4.44">you think about what public nouns is I</text><text start="560.64" dur="5.759">think it&apos;s yeah it&apos;s an nft related</text><text start="563.16" dur="5.4">project with a tie to public goods which</text><text start="566.399" dur="4.261">is also if you buy this thing it is you</text><text start="568.56" dur="4.8">know can be used as almost a badge of</text><text start="570.66" dur="4.5">support for something that you want to</text><text start="573.36" dur="3.78">show public support for</text><text start="575.16" dur="3.54">and so it&apos;s almost like that badge but</text><text start="577.14" dur="4.259">it can be used as your profile as well</text><text start="578.7" dur="5.1">and like it&apos;s almost built for someone</text><text start="581.399" dur="5.401">like vitalik um you know you could see</text><text start="583.8" dur="5.64">vitalik buying an optimism uh possum</text><text start="586.8" dur="5.159">public now which would be super cool</text><text start="589.44" dur="4.62">um and so the other cool thing is you</text><text start="591.959" dur="4.081">have these communities which are already</text><text start="594.06" dur="3.779">built and then you have</text><text start="596.04" dur="4.44">um different public noun heads from each</text><text start="597.839" dur="4.68">of those communities and and that has an</text><text start="600.48" dur="4.26">automatic attraction by the people from</text><text start="602.519" dur="3.781">those communities who already love</text><text start="604.74" dur="4.92">public goods and now they have a reason</text><text start="606.3" dur="5.219">to buy an awesome nft that is like gets</text><text start="609.66" dur="4.92">them governance in this cool experiment</text><text start="611.519" dur="5.161">and they get to

interesting</text><text start="741.899" dur="6.961">is if this money is used to fund people</text><text start="745.8" dur="5.099">and projects and crazy ideas that are</text><text start="748.86" dur="4.5">that are new and that are people</text><text start="750.899" dur="4.5">experimenting with in and around the</text><text start="753.36" dur="5.4">public good space so like The Meta</text><text start="755.399" dur="6.421">example is public nounsdao would love to</text><text start="758.76" dur="5.639">fund projects like public nounsdao right</text><text start="761.82" dur="4.98">so like is public nouns now a public</text><text start="764.399" dur="5.821">good I don&apos;t know not really like maybe</text><text start="766.8" dur="6.12">but actually we want to experiment we</text><text start="770.22" dur="5.1">want to actually fund more stuff more</text><text start="772.92" dur="3.78"> like public goods uh public nouns</text><text start="775.32" dur="3.78">now yeah</text><text start="776.7" dur="5.28">so is this the future of public goods</text><text start="779.1" dur="6.0">funding uh nft launches</text><text start="781.98" dur="5.76">I mean we need all the different sources</text><text start="785.1" dur="4.14">of funding possible Right to public</text><text start="787.74" dur="3.06">goods like that&apos;s the problem with</text><text start="789.24" dur="3.719">public kids it&apos;s like the sourcing of</text><text start="790.8" dur="5.339">funding and how funding can like alter</text><text start="792.959" dur="5.761">its motives and purpose and value uh</text><text start="796.139" dur="5.101">creation so I mean we need as many</text><text start="798.72" dur="4.799">things as possible this is definitely a</text><text start="801.24" dur="4.56">pretty radical example of it uh super</text><text start="803.519" dur="4.44">fun so far and like the yeah the</text><text start="805.8" dur="3.839">governance elements are really cool it&apos;s</text><text start="807.959" dur="3.361">not just a thing that&apos;s you know an nft</text><text start="809.639" dur="4.021">project that&apos;s raising money to a</text><text start="811.32" dur="4.319">centralized treasury that is going to go</text><text start="813.66" dur="3.78">to one thing you know it&apos;s really a dow</text><text start="815.639" dur="3.901">that one can participate in and over</text><text start="817.44" dur="3.3">time and help to like</text><text start="819.54" dur="3.359">um you know raise awareness around</text><text start="820.74" dur="4.14">public goods in general and build new</text><text start="822.899" dur="5.401">experiments together and and also</text><text start="824.88" dur="4.8">funding you know lastly basically uh but</text><text start="828.3" dur="4.08">uh yeah I mean I think it&apos;s going to</text><text start="829.68" dur="5.76">exist alongside things like Bitcoin and</text><text start="832.38" dur="5.699">CLR fund and radical and all that and</text><text start="835.44" dur="4.86">and sort of it&apos;s like like a new Avenue</text><text start="838.079" dur="5.461">for different types of users to to come</text><text start="840.3" dur="5.52">and and join and and fund public goods</text><text start="843.54" dur="4.38">um because you know like certain certain</text><text start="845.82" dur="4.139">Avenues feel more like a donation where</text><text start="847.92" dur="3.419">it&apos;s like you&apos;re selecting you know from</text><text start="849.959" dur="2.88">from a card of things and it&apos;s more</text><text start="851.339" dur="3.661">passive certain things are more like</text><text start="852.839" dur="4.8">active you know there&apos;s like doing good</text><text start="855.0" dur="5.22">which is also you know a way for artists</text><text start="857.639" dur="4.981">to launch Collections and and fund um</text><text start="860.22" dur="4.38">social impact projects on the side</text><text start="862.62" dur="6.18">um and so like public nouns I think it&apos;s</text><text start="864.6" dur="5.7">like a way for you know the people who</text><text start="868.8" dur="3.18">um would be interested in like bidding</text><text start="870.3" dur="3.779">for something that&apos;s</text><text start="871.98" dur="6.18">um that gets released like in a very</text><text start="874.079" dur="6.361">controlled manner like an nft to to join</text><text start="878.16" dur="4.08">like the the excitement as part of that</text><text start="880.44" dur="4.199">initial experience but also participate</text><text start="882.24" dur="4.56">in governance uh moving forward and I</text><text start="884.639" dur="4.621">think it&apos;s also like a nice uh</text><text start="886.8" dur="4.26">governance experience as well</text><text start="889.26" dur="4.379">um because you know one public noun</text><text start="891.06" dur="4.32">equals one vote which is</text><text start="893.639" dur="3.961">um you know there&apos;s like one token one</text><text start="895.38" dur="4.319">vote in in the context of the RC 20s in</text><text start="897.6" dur="4.26">in terms of like treasury governance</text><text start="899.699" dur="5.461">thus far and then there&apos;s also you know</text><text start="901.86" dur="5.76">uh like an ongoing effort to you know do</text><text start="905.16" dur="5.16">uh to to launch</text><text start="907.62" dur="4.44">um to do civil resistance which is like</text><text start="910.32" dur="4.199">one person one vote so I think one nft</text><text start="912.06" dur="6.42">one vote is somewhere lies somewhere um</text><text start="914.519" dur="5.76">between like in that Spectrum so it&apos;s um</text><text start="918.48" dur="4.5">yeah it&apos;s an interesting experiment to</text><text start="920.279" dur="5.461">see how um how things are being governed</text><text start="922.98" dur="5.039">um if it&apos;s like one of nft one vote yeah</text><text start="925.74" dur="5.58">quadratic making it quadratic has</text><text start="928.019" dur="6.06">actually been a suggestion from uh some</text><text start="931.32" dur="4.62">people in nounsdale in like some of the</text><text start="934.079" dur="3.421">public nouns here like eventually which</text><text start="935.94" dur="3.3">is interesting to think about because</text><text start="937.5" dur="3.6">it&apos;s not really too far off from the one</text><text start="939.24" dur="3.719">to one but if you have like a lot of</text><text start="941.1" dur="3.539">public nouns basically you just wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="942.959" dur="3.541">be able to</text><text start="944.639" dur="3.721">um you know really over exert your power</text><text start="946.5" dur="3.54">basically so yeah I don&apos;t know it could</text><text start="948.36" dur="2.94">be really interesting and yeah and that</text><text start="950.04" dur="2.82">we&apos;ve like we&apos;ve already been talking</text><text start="951.3" dur="3.899">about the different ways to bring</text><text start="952.86" dur="4.5">identity obviously or proof of of</text><text start="955.199" dur="4.681">uniqueness into that if we&apos;re going to</text><text start="957.36" dur="4.02">you know go for something like quadratic</text><text start="959.88" dur="4.5">so that you can&apos;t just like split up</text><text start="961.38" dur="4.8">your nouns but um that&apos;s something the</text><text start="964.38" dur="4.62">things that we also want to solve are</text><text start="966.18" dur="4.74">like same similar issues that like nouns</text><text start="969.0" dur="3.839">Dao probably needs to solve in the long</text><text start="970.92" dur="3.779">run and every derivation of nounsdale</text><text start="972.839" dur="4.44">you know we are in touch with the nouns</text><text start="974.699" dur="4.921">with now&apos;s Dao people and you know</text><text start="977.279" dur="4.261">what&apos;s cool is they also do public goods</text><text start="979.62" dur="5.1">like they&apos;ve given some money towards</text><text start="981.54" dur="5.22">the I believe the git coin Grant round</text><text start="984.72" dur="3.359">um but but they don&apos;t really have time</text><text start="986.76" dur="4.379">to like Focus</text><text start="988.079" dur="5.88">only on public goods right and so public</text><text start="991.139" dur="5.461">nouns be an extension of nounsdale</text><text start="993.959" dur="5.461">allows this mechanism to like really</text><text start="996.6" dur="5.159">dive in and focus on us on a very</text><text start="999.42" dur="4.38">specific vertical and I think we&apos;ll well</text><text start="1001.759" dur="3.841">we already there are other</text><text start="1003.8" dur="4.02">um nouns Dow derivatives that are also</text><text start="1005.6" dur="4.26">doing that in other areas but we&apos;ll see</text><text start="1007.82" dur="4.56">that more and more um and then we can</text><text start="1009.86" dur="4.56">all also borrow all from each other so</text><text start="1012.38" dur="3.78">we&apos;re already going to start putting a</text><text start="1014.42" dur="3.479">lot of the tools that nounsdale has</text><text start="1016.16" dur="3.179">created for their Community we&apos;re going</text><text start="1017.899" dur="2.581">to use those tools in our community and</text><text start="1019.339" dur="3.42">we&apos;re going to build new ones that</text><text start="1020.48" dur="3.9">they&apos;ll be able to use as well</text><text start="1022.759" dur="3.18">yeah it really is an incredible the</text><text start="1024.38" dur="4.319">nouns ecosystem is really incredible</text><text start="1025.939" dur="5.041">like yeah we&apos;ve only really forked the</text><text start="1028.699" dur="3.72">first part but uh now that everybody&apos;s</text><text start="1030.98" dur="2.459">kind of getting involved there&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1032.419" dur="3.42">a lot of other things we should probably</text><text start="1033.439" dur="5.941">Fork uh and get involved there&apos;s like</text><text start="1035.839" dur="6.181">the uh the fomo nouns mechanic uh fomo</text><text start="1039.38" dur="5.22">nouns dot what the which is where</text><text start="1042.02" dur="4.559">um you can go and vote at the at the</text><text start="1044.6" dur="3.42">time that the next noun is going to be</text><text start="1046.579" dur="4.021">minted you can like like the community</text><text start="1048.02" dur="5.399">can vote on which one it is basically or</text><text start="1050.6" dur="4.86">try to like upvote or down vote uh to</text><text start="1053.419" dur="3.721">kind of sway which one I think that</text><text start="1055.46" dur="4.5">could be an interesting mechanic in this</text><text start="1057.14" dur="4.38">uh public goods space I think uh whether</text><text start="1059.96" dur="3.9">like communities are wanting like less</text><text start="1061.52" dur="6.12">or more of a particular one to make it</text><text start="1063.86" dur="5.22">you know uh yeah like there&apos;s lots of</text><text start="1067.64" dur="2.88">different things and then with the</text><text start="1069.08" dur="2.94">different communities like the different</text><text start="1070.52" dur="3.42">public goods communities that are</text><text start="1072.02" dur="4.38">already as a part of public nouns and</text><text start="1073.94" dur="3.78">there will be more we&apos;ve talked about</text><text start="1076.4" dur="2.639">some interesting things that could</text><text start="1077.72" dur="4.44">happen with like</text><text start="1079.039" dur="5.941">for good cartels within the public nouns</text><text start="1082.16" dur="4.8">ecosystem right like Niche and her</text><text start="1084.98" dur="4.14">friends get together and you you have a</text><text start="1086.96" dur="4.56">Stampy and you guys love panvala you&apos;re</text><text start="1089.12" dur="5.34">gonna like you may try really hard to</text><text start="1091.52" dur="6.08">drive like more experimental money into</text><text start="1094.46" dur="5.4">the panvala ecosystem versus you know</text><text start="1097.6" dur="3.939">Kevin&apos;s gonna aim for the get coin</text><text start="1099.86" dur="3.96">ecosystem or something and so like you</text><text start="1101.539" dur="4.201">could have these weird cartels but</text><text start="1103.82" dur="4.32">they&apos;re all like four good cartels which</text><text start="1105.74" dur="4.14">is kind of crazy yeah</text><text start="1108.14" dur="4.94">cartels for good I think that should be</text><text start="1109.88" dur="3.2">a meme yeah</text><text start="1113.72" dur="3.48">um I think it&apos;s really interesting to</text><text start="1115.1" dur="3.959">see this pattern in the space in which</text><text start="1117.2" dur="3.479">you have these punctuated equilibriums</text><text start="1119.059" dur="4.081">and then it completely changes the game</text><text start="1120.679" dur="4.201">I mean molok Dao for me just like</text><text start="1123.14" dur="3.419">everyone forked Mo looked out and then</text><text start="1124.88" dur="4.62">there was a ecosystem of tools that were</text><text start="1126.559" dur="4.441">built around that uh when yam Finance</text><text start="1129.5" dur="4.919">came out everyone sort of was building</text><text start="1131.0" dur="6.059">yam forks for a little while there&apos;s the</text><text start="1134.419" dur="5.161">ohm Fork summer that we had and now it</text><text start="1137.059" dur="4.381">feels like we&apos;re in this nouns Fork uh</text><text start="1139.58" dur="5.64">ecosystem build out and punctuated</text><text start="1141.44" dur="5.64">equilibrium and I I I think it&apos;s neat</text><text start="1145.22" dur="4.44">the The Meta kind of changes every time</text><text start="1147.08" dur="4.62">one of these new things happens and then</text><text start="1149.66" dur="5.1">there&apos;s a ton of forks I&apos;m wondering if</text><text start="1151.7" dur="5.82">if you have any comments on on that or</text><text start="1154.76" dur="4.799">uh I guess I&apos;d just love to further dive</text><text start="1157.52" dur="3.899">deeper into the nouns ecosystem fomo</text><text start="1159.559" dur="3.661">nouns is really cool the fact that</text><text start="1161.419" dur="4.021">there&apos;s a builder where you can generate</text><text start="1163.22" dur="5.459">possible upcoming nouns is cool are</text><text start="1165.44" dur="4.979">there any other Cool Tools in the in the</text><text start="1168.679" dur="3.841">nouns ecosystem that you want to fork</text><text start="1170.419" dur="3.241">and bring into into public nouns and</text><text start="1172.52" dur="3.18">what is there relationship between</text><text start="1173.66" dur="3.84">public nouns and other nouns forks and</text><text start="1175.7" dur="3.66">nouns itself</text><text start="1177.5" dur="3.419">yeah I think we&apos;re definitely starting</text><text start="1179.36" dur="2.819">to build those relationships now we&apos;re</text><text start="1180.919" dur="2.64">trying to like reach out because we&apos;re</text><text start="1182.179" dur="3.961">real we&apos;re realizing we need some of</text><text start="1183.559" dur="4.081">these things uh so yeah if anybody&apos;s in</text><text start="1186.14" dur="4.08">the nouns ecosystem hit us up for sure</text><text start="1187.64" dur="4.98">uh but uh I don&apos;t know yeah there&apos;s a</text><text start="1190.22" dur="4.92">lot of cool stuff out there yes guy yeah</text><text start="1192.62" dur="4.38">yeah like there&apos;s tools to because these</text><text start="1195.14" dur="4.08">things are one every 12 hours right and</text><text start="1197.0" dur="4.26">not everyone has time to like every day</text><text start="1199.22" dur="4.38">look at these twice a day there are</text><text start="1201.26" dur="5.64">tools for auto bidding um from your</text><text start="1203.6" dur="6.0">community or from you as a person</text><text start="1206.9" dur="4.38">um there&apos;s ways to like better analyze</text><text start="1209.6" dur="4.199">what&apos;s what&apos;s out there and what people</text><text

public nouns and so then you</text><text start="1229.58" dur="4.44">get this really interesting</text><text start="1231.919" dur="4.62">um yeah there&apos;s not just individual</text><text start="1234.02" dur="4.62">people but you get teams of people that</text><text start="1236.539" dur="5.401">maybe can pull together and acquire</text><text start="1238.64" dur="5.52">these things and then they&apos;ll yeah in</text><text start="1241.94" dur="4.2">one in in one scenario</text><text start="1244.16" dur="4.8">um like there is probably going to be a</text><text start="1246.14" dur="5.22">Malik Dao that actually owns a like a</text><text start="1248.96" dur="4.92">set of public nouns and so you can</text><text start="1251.36" dur="4.679">actually just join that dial probably to</text><text start="1253.88" dur="4.32">to have influence in the public nouns</text><text start="1256.039" dur="3.901">ecosystem via holding and this is all</text><text start="1258.2" dur="4.14">stuff that happened with nouns like</text><text start="1259.94" dur="5.34">shark Dao I think acquired two of the</text><text start="1262.34" dur="4.74">first five or six nouns</text><text start="1265.28" dur="3.12">um and so like this has been this has</text><text start="1267.08" dur="3.9">happened all along</text><text start="1268.4" dur="4.56">um and it it also it also opens the</text><text start="1270.98" dur="3.42">opportunity for people that might not be</text><text start="1272.96" dur="3.36">able to buy a full public noun</text><text start="1274.4" dur="3.48">themselves</text><text start="1276.32" dur="3.359">yeah and one cool thing that another</text><text start="1277.88" dur="3.96">really cool thing they have over there</text><text

dur="6.301">proposals and get your projects that are</text><text start="1445.34" dur="4.38">noun-ish funded in in the mechanic there</text><text start="1447.86" dur="3.299">is is interesting so you all think that</text><text start="1449.72" dur="4.14">you might adopt that for public nouns</text><text start="1451.159" dur="4.02">right yeah exactly yeah I think I mean I</text><text start="1453.86" dur="3.78">think it&apos;d be really cool it&apos;d be a way</text><text start="1455.179" dur="4.681">I mean I think I mean public goods is</text><text start="1457.64" dur="3.659">uh there&apos;s a thing with public goods</text><text start="1459.86" dur="3.96">where like the public should be involved</text><text start="1461.299" dur="5.701">right so like I think just because we&apos;re</text><text start="1463.82" dur="5.099">now I think we should be looking uh very</text><text start="1467.0" dur="5.28">be very very cognizant about you know</text><text start="1468.919" dur="6.12">being uh receiving signal and input from</text><text start="1472.28" dur="4.74">uh you know up the public that we are</text><text start="1475.039" dur="4.441">trying to serve or whatever so yeah I</text><text start="1477.02" dur="5.46">believe I believe one of the main</text><text start="1479.48" dur="4.74">um functions of it is actually you know</text><text start="1482.48" dur="4.559">to borrow from Bitcoin rounds right</text><text start="1484.22" dur="5.939">instead of having continuous</text><text start="1487.039" dur="6.361">git coin donations forever every week</text><text start="1490.159" dur="5.341">every day like in a continuous Thing by</text><text start="1493.4" dur="4.08">by creating rounds you have the focus</text><text start="1495.5" dur="4.44">and attention of people to make</text><text start="1497.48" dur="6.0">decisions like for the week that it&apos;s</text><text start="1499.94" dur="5.64">live and they can decide between the all</text><text start="1503.48" dur="4.26">of the options and they don&apos;t have to</text><text start="1505.58" dur="4.26">follow it every month right all month</text><text start="1507.74" dur="3.72">long they only have to come in one day</text><text start="1509.84" dur="4.079">during that round and make a decision</text><text start="1511.46" dur="4.68">and so prop house I think part of the</text><text start="1513.919" dur="4.801">point of that was instead of having</text><text start="1516.14" dur="5.64">continuous proposals all day long every</text><text start="1518.72" dur="5.76">day you you focus them in batches and</text><text start="1521.78" dur="4.56">then you get to pick and choose and</text><text start="1524.48" dur="4.38">focus your and it takes less time and</text><text start="1526.34" dur="4.62">attention and so it&apos;s all you know it</text><text start="1528.86" dur="5.52">actually probably came from the frame</text><text start="1530.96" dur="5.579">from how Bitcoin rounds work yeah yeah I</text><text start="1534.38" dur="5.76">think I think how it works is um it kind</text><text start="1536.539" dur="4.861">of turns uh it on its head where East is</text><text start="1540.14" dur="4.8">the thing that&apos;s actually being</text><text start="1541.4" dur="7.139">auctioned off and uh proposals are the</text><text start="1544.94" dur="5.46">the bidders and people go vote on it and</text><text start="1548.539" dur="3.661">I think if you&apos;re above a certain a</text><text start="1550.4" dur="3.06">certain threshold of votes that you get</text><text start="1552.2" dur="4.04">funded with the youth that&apos;s being</text><text start="1553.46" dur="4.86">auctioned off for that time period</text><text start="1556.24" dur="3.76">so the community kind of submits</text><text start="1558.32" dur="3.66">proposals and then the Dow comes in and</text><text start="1560.0" dur="4.14">fun it&apos;s almost like a reverse proposal</text><text start="1561.98" dur="3.96">mechanism to I think how a lot of</text><text start="1564.14" dur="3.32">Adele&apos;s were</text><text start="1565.94" dur="3.599">yeah yeah</text><text start="1567.46" dur="4.06">there&apos;s lots of interesting stuff if you</text><text start="1569.539" dur="4.5">go to prop.house that&apos;s the website for</text><text start="1571.52" dur="4.399">it

start="1609.799" dur="3.12">dollars may have gotten that wrong I</text><text start="1611.539" dur="3.901">think it&apos;s more right</text><text start="1612.919" dur="3.481">okay how much is Heath

start="1636.799" dur="3.36">interested in seeing lots of things</text><text start="1638.059" dur="4.141">getting notified as the noun ecosystem</text><text start="1640.159" dur="3.481">grows and

a</text><text start="1645.38" dur="4.74">really cool mechanic uh I mean part of</text><text start="1647.72" dur="4.68">the I mean one of the things that really</text><text start="1650.12" dur="4.62">got us a lot of us to start staring at</text><text start="1652.4" dur="5.46">it so obsessively at the beginning was</text><text start="1654.74" dur="5.58">its problem though uh which is like the</text><text start="1657.86" dur="4.38">51 attack thing</text><text start="1660.32" dur="3.599">um you know it&apos;s uh we still haven&apos;t</text><text start="1662.24" dur="2.819">really figured out coin voting and it</text><text start="1663.919" dur="2.88">really isn&apos;t that different from that</text><text start="1665.059" dur="3.541">you know you can buy a public noun you</text><text start="1666.799" dur="3.36">can buy Power with capital</text><text start="1668.6" dur="3.6">um therefore you are always at risk at</text><text start="1670.159" dur="3.601">about 51 attack</text><text start="1672.2" dur="3.599">um so they have so they you know they</text><text start="1673.76" dur="4.32">saw that veto right as we do still too</text><text start="1675.799" dur="5.161">for yeah we can&apos;t submit proposals from</text><text start="1678.08" dur="4.32">from the peanut or multi-cig and neither</text><text start="1680.96" dur="4.319">can the nounders but they can be two</text><text start="1682.4" dur="4.019">things which in our case which in our</text><text start="1685.279" dur="3.361">case is kind of interesting because</text><text start="1686.419" dur="4.801">we&apos;re like yeah we are actually supposed</text><text start="1688.64" dur="4.74">to be doing something with the like with</text><text start="1691.22" dur="4.14">a purpose with the funding</text><text start="1693.38" dur="4.08">um but regardless I think we would all</text><text start="1695.36" dur="3.9">prefer to get rid of the veto as soon as</text><text start="1697.46" dur="3.12">possible but it&apos;s a hard problem to</text><text start="1699.26" dur="3.299">solve that we really haven&apos;t solved in</text><text start="1700.58" dur="6.06">the space yet so</text><text start="1702.559" dur="5.761">um and you know it&apos;s uh I think</text><text start="1706.64" dur="3.48">well yeah I think that&apos;s definitely why</text><text start="1708.32" dur="4.2">I got super excited about navs in the</text><text start="1710.12" dur="4.38">first place was looking at that problem</text><text start="1712.52" dur="4.86">and like thinking about that problem and</text><text start="1714.5" dur="4.679">like where uh you know coming from like</text><text start="1717.38" dur="3.539">the more of the molecular ecosystem</text><text start="1719.179" dur="3.781">myself but also interacting with like</text><text start="1720.919" dur="5.041">many many coin dials and like I&apos;ve seen</text><text start="1722.96" dur="5.52">those those differences over the over</text><text start="1725.96" dur="4.14">the years in the kind of like the The</text><text start="1728.48" dur="3.54">Duality of those</text><text start="1730.1" dur="3.9">um announced out kind of feels like</text><text start="1732.02" dur="4.019">somewhere in the middle potentially if</text><text start="1734.0" dur="4.08">we can solve that 51 attack with</text><text start="1736.039" dur="5.041">nounsdale then I think we might have</text><text start="1738.08" dur="6.18">something really awesome for for</text><text start="1741.08" dur="3.839">governance for large communities of

start="1749.6" dur="3.12">yes I mean I&apos;d love to turn the</text><text start="1751.279" dur="3.301">conversation towards public goods</text><text start="1752.72" dur="3.9">funding one of my sort

funding</text><text start="1766.1" dur="4.86">and so you know there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1769.1" dur="3.36">different things that check those</text><text start="1770.96" dur="3.18">different boxes but if we can find</text><text start="1772.46" dur="4.26">something that&apos;s that&apos;s legitimate</text><text start="1774.14" dur="4.259">recurring and deep then then that gets</text><text start="1776.72" dur="3.059">really exciting to me and I think the</text><text start="1778.399" dur="2.701">public nouns is off to a good start</text><text start="1779.779" dur="3.421">because it&apos;s legitimate it seems to be</text><text start="1781.1" dur="3.72">beloved it&apos;s recurring every 12 hours</text><text start="1783.2" dur="3.12">it&apos;s raising four

it&apos;s pretty high</text><text start="1796.1" dur="6.12">upside to me I&apos;d be curious if if you</text><text start="1798.559" dur="6.12">all have any uh views on on how public</text><text

that sounds</text><text start="1815.36" dur="3.96">like a decent amount of money like if</text><text start="1817.279" dur="3.78">you actually think how many public goods</text><text start="1819.32" dur="3.719">need to be funded in the world we&apos;re</text><text start="1821.059" dur="4.98">talking like billions or trillions right</text><text start="1823.039" dur="5.401">so like public nouns that that was not</text><text start="1826.039" dur="6.721">gonna be able to do this so we need like</text><text start="1828.44" dur="6.18">this exponential effect and and so I</text><text start="1832.76" dur="4.38">don&apos;t know in like a normal hackathon in</text><text start="1834.62" dur="4.74">our space like I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a</text><text start="1837.14"

you</text><text start="1844.399" dur="5.28">just described to solve that need and so</text><text start="1846.919" dur="6.061">public nouns now could put more funding</text><text start="1849.679" dur="6.181">towards the bounties for people that</text><text start="1852.98" dur="5.52">could figure out bigger Solutions and</text><text start="1855.86" dur="4.98">other solutions that can scale that but</text><text start="1858.5" dur="3.72">yeah I don&apos;t think we can&apos;t just make a</text><text start="1860.84" dur="3.36">bunch of public nouns Dallas that&apos;s</text><text start="1862.22" dur="3.959">going to like solve all the funding but</text><text start="1864.2" dur="4.16">we need to like create this so that</text><text start="1866.179" dur="5.041">there&apos;s this honey pot for people to</text><text start="1868.36" dur="5.02">make more stuff that can then solve that</text><text start="1871.22" dur="4.319">problem or start start the process to</text><text start="1873.38" dur="4.26">solve that problem and then build from</text><text start="1875.539" dur="4.74">there and then eventually I think you&apos;re</text><text start="1877.64" dur="4.259">going to need kind of some of the you</text><text start="1880.279" dur="3.9">have these things like built into</text><text start="1881.899" dur="4.681">protocols like I guess optimism would be</text><text start="1884.179" dur="4.86">the example where this big protocol and</text><text start="1886.58" dur="5.099">a portion of that thing or a portion of</text><text start="1889.039" dur="5.281">a project is going towards

goes through your system</text><text start="1906.32" dur="4.5">towards public goods and so if you can</text><text start="1908.24" dur="6.539">create that Dynamic that&apos;s how we get to</text><text start="1910.82" dur="7.8">like billions and trillions I think yeah</text><text start="1914.779" dur="5.701">in public nounsdale JK</text><text start="1918.62" dur="4.32">I like that&apos;s a good question like how</text><text start="1920.48" dur="4.26">to scale the the funding of public nouns</text><text start="1922.94" dur="3.239">that was interesting and like I mean I</text><text start="1924.74" dur="2.939">do think that there are I&apos;m still trying</text><text start="1926.179" dur="4.021">to like there&apos;s a lot there&apos;s a more</text><text start="1927.679" dur="5.22">primitive I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve really</text><text start="1930.2" dur="5.579">uncovered the real primitive power of</text><text start="1932.899" dur="5.341">what the noun style system</text><text start="1935.779" dur="4.201">uh is capable of</text><text start="1938.24" dur="3.299">um I think there is a more primitive</text><text start="1939.98" dur="4.02">thing there that we haven&apos;t revealed yet</text><text start="1941.539" dur="4.201">that likely does have broader</text><text start="1944.0" dur="2.84">applications</text><text start="1945.74" dur="4.439">um</text><text start="1946.84" dur="5.02">which is my guess I think this is kind</text><text start="1950.179" dur="3.841">of a you know it&apos;s one of those Frontier</text><text start="1951.86" dur="5.58">problem spaces that I think is really</text><text start="1954.02" dur="4.62">very hard and challenging so you know I</text><text start="1957.44" dur="3.18">don&apos;t I don&apos;t fault you for getting lost</text><text start="1958.64" dur="3.659">in it it just seems like it&apos;s one of the</text><text start="1960.62" dur="4.08">most high upside for the space Also and</text><text start="1962.299" dur="4.441">it&apos;s it&apos;s really impressive how how</text><text start="1964.7" dur="4.14">nouns has sort of grown into this</text><text start="1966.74" dur="4.919">ecosystem that it not only creates a lot</text><text start="1968.84" dur="4.319">of funding but also has innovated in how</text><text start="1971.659" dur="3.781">that funding is distributed with things</text><text start="1973.159" dur="4.201">like prop house so it&apos;ll be it&apos;ll be</text><text start="1975.44" dur="2.7">interesting to see what public nouns can</text><text start="1977.36" dur="3.0">do</text><text start="1978.14" dur="4.68">um if I&apos;m you know a median green pill</text><text start="1980.36" dur="4.5">listener maybe I work in D5 or

start="2009.399" dur="3.601">um so the degen&apos;s I think that you were</text><text start="2012.159" dur="1.86">talking about they should know that</text><text start="2013.0" dur="2.22">already and I think they&apos;re probably</text><text start="2014.019" dur="3.061">just going to clear it clean out the</text><text start="2015.22" dur="3.319">public down so if the regions don&apos;t pick</text><text start="2017.08" dur="4.979">up their pick up their game a little bit</text><text start="2018.539" dur="5.801">uh but yeah otherwise I mean</text><text start="2022.059" dur="4.801">um you know I think this is public goods</text><text start="2024.34" dur="3.959">uh and we need as many we don&apos;t need we</text><text start="2026.86" dur="2.76">don&apos;t just need as much funding

dur="4.02">as well so</text><text start="2033.7" dur="5.28">um you know definitely encourage anybody</text><text start="2035.919" dur="5.76">to hop into the Discord and just yeah</text><text start="2038.98" dur="4.559">start figuring out a way to contribute</text><text start="2041.679" dur="3.36">um I&apos;m sure any of the public nouns that</text><text start="2043.539" dur="3.841">would be like welcome to that there&apos;s</text><text start="2045.039" dur="5.041">documentation there&apos;s lots of things</text><text start="2047.38" dur="5.34">that could use some support yeah and one</text><text start="2050.08" dur="5.7">of the I think early tasks of the of</text><text start="2052.72" dur="5.82">public nouns Dao is gonna to also help</text><text start="2055.78" dur="4.8">better Define what kind of public goods</text><text start="2058.54" dur="3.42">are because public goods is so broad</text><text start="2060.58" dur="3.059">right now that like

start="2065.74" dur="5.939">of different ways and so helping to</text><text start="2067.48" dur="6.3">Define that is a community like goal</text><text start="2071.679" dur="4.16">um and then what that allows is most of</text><text start="2073.78" dur="4.74">yeah most of these earliest</text><text start="2075.839" dur="7.121">organizations that are part of the</text><text start="2078.52" dur="7.02">public nouns organization are like good</text><text start="2082.96" dur="5.939">with funding right like focused on</text><text start="2085.54" dur="5.22">funding and so as we grow with and open</text><text start="2088.899" dur="4.44">to more organizations we have already</text><text start="2090.76" dur="4.139">talked about maybe having more builder</text><text start="2093.339" dur="3.78">organizations</text><text start="2094.899" dur="4.381">um that are public goods related like in</text><text start="2097.119" dur="4.381">the next cohort maybe so</text><text start="2099.28" dur="4.079">um that you start to balance the skill</text><text start="2101.5" dur="6.42">sets that are just even in the Public</text><text start="2103.359" dur="7.621">Public nouns Dow ecosystem and so making</text><text start="2107.92" dur="5.28">sure that it grows with thought</text><text start="2110.98" dur="4.92">um and and anyone that has ideas around</text><text start="2113.2" dur="4.5">that or other organizations that could</text><text start="2115.9" dur="4.199">be a good part a good fit for that</text><text start="2117.7" dur="5.159">should reach out in the Discord and and</text><text start="2120.099" dur="4.381">share their ideas</text><text start="2122.859" dur="5.401">um if I remember correctly like every</text><text start="2124.48" dur="5.58">30th public uh public noun gets sent to</text><text start="2128.26" dur="4.079">um like certain places so there&apos;s like</text><text start="2130.06" dur="4.32">one that gets sent to uh like non-style</text><text start="2132.339" dur="5.581">itself this one that gets sentenced to</text><text start="2134.38" dur="7.02">like um peanutter so it might be a way</text><text start="2137.92" dur="5.04">to um you know get like Sweat Equity</text><text start="2141.4" dur="4.98">um like the price point to enter right</text><text start="2142.96" dur="4.8">now is much much lower than the uh than</text><text start="2146.38" dur="3.6">the nouns now I think like we&apos;re</text><text start="2147.76" dur="4.38">averaging we&apos;re at the 12th noun and</text><text start="2149.98" dur="5.7">like the average is about five eighth</text><text start="2152.14" dur="6.3">which is like a far cry from uh the 600e</text><text start="2155.68" dur="4.26">that like the first actual noun have</text><text start="2158.44" dur="3.54">been sold for</text><text start="2159.94" dur="3.54">um so it&apos;s still like kind of um Hefty</text><text start="2161.98" dur="4.379">but uh</text><text start="2163.48" dur="4.98">yeah it&apos;s still manageable</text><text start="2166.359" dur="3.361">nice uh is there anything I didn&apos;t ask</text><text start="2168.46" dur="2.94">that you want to tell us about public</text><text start="2169.72" dur="3.66">nouns</text><text start="2171.4" dur="3.78">uh I don&apos;t know but I did think of one</text><text start="2173.38" dur="3.6">other thing though that about something</text><text start="2175.18" dur="4.679">you said earlier which is</text><text start="2176.98" dur="4.44">right well what I lost earlier was the</text><text start="2179.859" dur="2.641">your question about how to scale the</text><text start="2181.42" dur="3.179">funding which I think there is some</text><text start="2182.5" dur="4.02">interesting things there but why would</text><text start="2184.599" dur="4.321">we want to scale the funding is why I</text><text start="2186.52" dur="4.2">got lost in like one reason</text><text start="2188.92" dur="5.58">that I&apos;m interested in that question is</text><text start="2190.72" dur="7.02">because there&apos;s a uh</text><text start="2194.5" dur="5.099">uh what was that guy&apos;s name on the on</text><text start="2197.74" dur="4.26">the green pill last week with the</text><text start="2199.599" dur="4.26">network ology stuff uh Chris oh</text><text start="2202.0" dur="3.24">Christopher vitelli yeah and he was</text><text start="2203.859" dur="5.181">talking about those like four properties</text><text start="2205.24" dur="7.44">of emergence which are like uh diversity</text><text start="2209.04" dur="7.0">I think like connectedness uh</text><text start="2212.68" dur="5.22">how distributed something is in like the</text><text start="2216.04" dur="3.539">stability or meta stability more like</text><text start="2217.9" dur="4.86">the not really being stable but like</text><text start="2219.579" dur="4.681">stable enough basically so like so like</text><text start="2222.76" dur="3.78">applying that to like something like</text><text start="2224.26" dur="4.8">public nouns and like figuring out where</text><text start="2226.54" dur="4.559">the emergence is and the emergencies in</text><text start="2229.06" dur="6.12">the community right so like</text><text start="2231.099" dur="5.281">the and one of the the you know if you</text><text start="2235.18" dur="2.82">think back up and think about those</text><text start="2236.38" dur="2.94">properties like the connectedness is</text><text start="2238.0" dur="3.359">public goods so that&apos;s like the</text><text start="2239.32" dur="3.96">connectedness that of the but there&apos;s</text><text start="2241.359" dur="3.121">like all these different people from all</text><text start="2243.28" dur="2.819">over the world from different</text><text start="2244.48" dur="5.52">communities and that&apos;s the diversity</text><text start="2246.099" dur="7.141">part but then the meta stability and the</text><text start="2250.0" dur="4.56">uh distributed modes of organizing or</text><text start="2253.24" dur="3.06">whatever</text><text start="2254.56" dur="6.779">um those things I think are the things</text><text start="2256.3" dur="7.5">that are going forward basically that if</text><text start="2261.339" dur="3.661">if it if if it happens if a community</text><text start="2263.8" dur="2.94">stays together like all these people</text><text start="2265.0" dur="4.02">basically came together into this place</text><text start="2266.74" dur="4.2">and are still coming in together to do</text><text start="2269.02" dur="5.4">it but if that if there is emergence</text><text start="2270.94" dur="4.679">there then it could be a place of a lot</text><text start="2274.42" dur="4.26">of people who really care about public</text><text start="2275.619" dur="5.521">goods and show a track record of</text><text start="2278.68" dur="4.5">supporting public goods and they may</text><text start="2281.14" dur="4.199">become a dow that can be a recipient of</text><text start="2283.18" dur="3.659">retroactive public goods funding</text><text start="2285.339" dur="3.661">um that could scale their funding but</text><text start="2286.839" dur="4.74">you know first I think track record and</text><text start="2289.0" dur="5.04">all that like uh legitimacy part like</text><text start="2291.579" dur="4.321">you said I think basically would be yeah</text><text start="2294.04" dur="3.299">it&apos;s pretty cool so far but I think that</text><text start="2295.9" dur="3.48">yeah there&apos;s more legitimacy we need to</text><text start="2297.339" dur="5.161">start actually like making some impact</text><text start="2299.38" dur="6.06">and like all those types of things uh</text><text start="2302.5" dur="4.26">but yeah I do think that&apos;s it one part</text><text start="2305.44" dur="2.639">of the interesting meta to the whole</text><text start="2306.76" dur="3.359">thing is just us all getting together</text><text start="2308.079" dur="4.861">from the public good space in one place</text><text start="2310.119" dur="6.541">and not on our silos to to talk of them</text><text start="2312.94" dur="6.24">and uh Discord about public goods</text><text start="2316.66" dur="3.84">yeah some some uh already I think we</text><text start="2319.18" dur="3.96">talked about a little bit about some</text><text start="2320.5" dur="4.98">ideas around retroactive and retroactive</text><text start="2323.14" dur="4.62">is really interesting so doing like some</text><text start="2325.48" dur="4.26">public good um I don&apos;t know what you</text><text start="2327.76" dur="4.38">call them in a nice way bombs like some</text><text start="2329.74" dur="4.74">retro bombs of public goods funding to</text><text start="2332.14" dur="4.86">like people that have done awesome stuff</text><text start="2334.48" dur="4.2">in the in the public good space so just</text><text start="2337.0" dur="3.78">to lay those out send us out there and</text><text start="2338.68" dur="5.399">then like hopefully more people do it</text><text start="2340.78" dur="5.94">and and they can get that award as well</text><text start="2344.079" dur="5.641">need anything to add</text><text start="2346.72" dur="5.7">yeah I think um I mean it&apos;s it&apos;s early</text><text start="2349.72" dur="6.06">days like we we have kind of a soft</text><text start="2352.42" dur="5.46">proposal like our first soft proposal to</text><text start="2355.78" dur="5.46">um for funding</text><text start="2357.88" dur="7.26">um going out uh I think we&apos;re discussing</text><text start="2361.24" dur="4.64">um being a part of uh CLR funds</text><text start="2365.14" dur="3.86">um</text><text start="2365.88" dur="5.68">uh funding round or like matching pool</text><text start="2369.0" dur="4.599">uh during Devcon so I think that&apos;s a</text><text start="2371.56" dur="4.5">nice kind of starting point for us to</text><text start="2373.599" dur="5.281">experiment with you know</text><text start="2376.06" dur="4.5">um what what the community wants to find</text><text start="2378.88" dur="4.32">um how much uh to fund and like setting</text><text start="2380.56" dur="5.1">an initial Cadence around</text><text start="2383.2" dur="5.639">um like how how we want to get involved</text><text start="2385.66" dur="5.939">in that and so this this specific round</text><text start="2388.839" dur="4.081">is um focused on funding public goods
