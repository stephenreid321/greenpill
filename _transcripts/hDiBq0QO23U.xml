have David</text><text start="6.899" dur="4.681">ehrlichmann who is the author of a book</text><text start="8.82" dur="6.3">about impact networks and also the</text><text start="11.58" dur="5.16">co-founder of the hats protocol so</text><text start="15.12" dur="3.96">basically impact networks has been a</text><text start="16.74" dur="4.74">really influential thing for me a</text><text start="19.08" dur="4.92">because networks are a basic unified</text><text start="21.48" dur="4.799">pattern uh that we see all over the</text><text start="24.0" dur="4.5">world from biological networks neural</text><text start="26.279" dur="5.58">networks to economic networks to now</text><text start="28.5" dur="5.94">dowels as networks and so basically</text><text start="31.859" dur="4.38">impact networks which David has written</text><text start="34.44" dur="5.22">a book on and we go into in this episode</text><text start="36.239" dur="5.461">are a really great approach or structure</text><text start="39.66" dur="4.02">to understand when you&apos;re facing complex</text><text start="41.7" dur="3.12">issues and with greater levels of</text><text start="43.68" dur="3.84">connectivity are needed between</text><text start="44.82" dur="4.68">individuals in order to address the</text><text start="47.52" dur="4.199">issue than would otherwise be

dur="4.98">networks in this episodes the five C&apos;s</text><text start="56.46" dur="3.9">of impact networks clarifying purpose in</text><text start="59.039" dur="4.081">principles convening the

we kind of go back and forth between</text><text start="66.96" dur="4.14">Theory and action in this episode</text><text start="68.64" dur="4.799">David&apos;s also a Founder has implemented</text><text start="71.1" dur="4.44">this stuff in the past and can abstract</text><text start="73.439" dur="3.961">the theory out but has the object level</text><text start="75.54" dur="3.42">experience of implementing it and I</text><text start="77.4" dur="2.82">think that&apos;s why he said it&apos;s a</text><text start="78.96" dur="2.519">fascinating person to talk to and</text><text start="80.22" dur="2.759">honestly impact networks is one of my</text><text start="81.479" dur="3.78">favorite books that I&apos;ve read in the</text><text start="82.979" dur="4.381">last few years so what are the ways that</text><text start="85.259" dur="3.9">we can leverage networks to create more</text><text start="87.36" dur="4.799">impact than we could in a hierarchical</text><text start="89.159" dur="5.041">organization what do these lessons of</text><text start="92.159" dur="4.381">impact networks have to do with Dows</text><text start="94.2" dur="4.379">what does dow leadership look like how</text><text start="96.54" dur="4.079">can we Foster self-organization promote</text><text start="98.579" dur="4.561">emergence Embrace change and

and coordinated</text><text start="268.32" dur="5.159">to do so much more than just create</text><text start="270.6" dur="5.819">connection they can also be organized</text><text start="273.479"

networks</text><text start="294.18" dur="5.519">deliberately organize to produce some</text><text start="296.4" dur="5.579">kind of impact Hmm got it and how did</text><text start="299.699" dur="6.361">you come to study impact Networks</text><text start="301.979" dur="6.0">it it goes way back about 15 years ago I</text><text start="306.06" dur="4.859">was working at a non-profit organization</text><text start="307.979" dur="5.521">and you know there I was noticing that</text><text start="310.919" dur="5.28">they were doing great work but they were</text><text start="313.5" dur="4.74">so focused on their own programs and</text><text start="316.199" dur="4.861">their own organization&apos;s health and kind</text><text start="318.24" dur="5.04">of the annual cycle of fundraising which</text><text start="321.06" dur="5.94">is totally reasonable it&apos;s it&apos;s the</text><text start="323.28" dur="5.82">pressures that the social sector uh</text><text start="327.0" dur="3.96">fundraising processes put these</text><text start="329.1" dur="3.42">organizations into we have to show a</text><text start="330.96" dur="4.14">direct connection between the funding</text><text start="332.52" dur="4.679">you get and the impact you create and it</text><text start="335.1" dur="4.22">really disincentivizes collaboration in</text><text start="337.199" dur="5.101">a lot of ways and and the work where</text><text start="339.32" dur="5.26">it&apos;s not clear the direct impact you&apos;re</text><text start="342.3" dur="4.98">having but uh you&apos;re you&apos;re creating</text><text start="344.58" dur="4.619">some kind of larger systemic change and</text><text start="347.28" dur="3.72">and so when I was there I started to get</text><text start="349.199" dur="4.201">really curious about how we could work</text><text start="351.0" dur="4.86">not just within individual organizations</text><text start="353.4" dur="4.44">but really across organizations and</text><text start="355.86" dur="4.74">across sectors and communities to</text><text start="357.84" dur="5.1">address these big systemic issues we&apos;re</text><text start="360.6" dur="4.319">faced with so many big systemic complex</text><text start="362.94" dur="3.78">challenges and to address systemic</text><text start="364.919" dur="4.021">issues we have to work systemically and</text><text start="366.72" dur="4.199">that means crossing the silos and the</text><text start="368.94" dur="4.08">boundaries that that usually separate us</text><text start="370.919" dur="5.821">so that was kind of the key question</text><text start="373.02" dur="5.519">that I held in my head it led me to a</text><text start="376.74" dur="3.48">year at a consulting firm monitor</text><text start="378.539" dur="3.261">Institute where I learned more about</text><text start="380.22" dur="3.84">deliberate approaches to</text><text start="381.8" dur="5.019">multi-stakeholder collaboration and and</text><text start="384.06" dur="4.68">learn that there were networks out there</text><text start="386.819" dur="5.461">that were deliberately organized and</text><text start="388.74" dur="6.48">even staffed to connect upwards of 150</text><text start="392.28" dur="5.039">different organizations in one case to</text><text start="395.22" dur="4.08">reduce carbon emissions across nine</text><text start="397.319" dur="4.32">states in the Midwest and that Network</text><text start="399.3" dur="4.08">reamp had some pretty amazing impacts</text><text start="401.639" dur="3.0">and so I started to get really and I&apos;ve</text><text start="403.38" dur="3.24">inspired I was kind of a light bulb</text><text start="404.639" dur="5.101">moment for me oh my gosh it&apos;s actually</text><text start="406.62" dur="5.04">possible to strategically weave</text><text start="409.74" dur="4.739">organizations together around these</text><text start="411.66" dur="6.06">bigger issues that we that many of them</text><text start="414.479" dur="5.641">touch and and so I left that consulting</text><text start="417.72" dur="5.64">firm and helped to start a network</text><text start="420.12" dur="4.859">myself that was connecting 48 different</text><text start="423.36" dur="3.559">organizational leaders in their</text><text start="424.979" dur="6.121">organizations to revitalize the City</text><text start="426.919" dur="6.161">Fresno California later I&apos;ll start a</text><text start="431.1" dur="3.599">network of 24 different organizations</text><text start="433.08" dur="3.959">working to Steward half a million acres</text><text start="434.699" dur="6.361">of land and large landscape stewardship</text><text start="437.039" dur="6.181">is necessarily A systemic issue as a</text><text start="441.06" dur="3.72">simple example of that is if you get rid</text><text start="443.22" dur="2.94">of all the invasive species on your land</text><text start="444.78" dur="3.479">and your neighbor hasn&apos;t done the same</text><text start="446.16" dur="4.68">it doesn&apos;t much matter right so you have</text><text start="448.259" dur="3.901">to coordinate at a systems level that</text><text start="450.84" dur="3.9">means bringing together the government</text><text start="452.16" dur="3.9">agencies and non-profits and academic</text><text start="454.74" dur="3.299">institutions and tribal groups and</text><text start="456.06" dur="3.78">Timber companies together and dig in</text><text start="458.039" dur="4.44">where they disagree a lot of</text><text start="459.84" dur="4.02">disagreement but also where they do</text><text start="462.479" dur="2.641">agree and bring the different pieces of</text><text start="463.86" dur="3.239">the puzzle together to see the whole</text><text start="465.12" dur="3.479">system and how we can act and coordinate</text><text start="467.099" dur="3.781">to improve the health of the whole</text><text start="468.599" dur="5.1">system long story short you know</text><text start="470.88" dur="5.039">continued doing that work in a wide</text><text start="473.699" dur="5.181">variety of fields and all over the world</text><text start="475.919" dur="6.661">with over 50 different impact networks</text><text start="478.88" dur="5.14">and saw common lessons and patterns that</text><text start="482.58" dur="2.88">were arising between them even though</text><text start="484.02" dur="2.82">they were really different in terms of</text><text start="485.46" dur="4.98">different in terms of the place and the</text><text start="486.84" dur="5.28">context and that&apos;s what became the book</text><text start="490.44" dur="4.5">impact Networks</text><text start="492.12" dur="4.74">and you know from there after that I I</text><text start="494.94" dur="3.78">started to really put a lot more</text><text start="496.86" dur="4.14">attention into what was happening with</text><text start="498.72" dur="5.22">Dows because there was so much overlap</text><text start="501.0" dur="4.8">in terms of it&apos;s all about decentralized</text><text start="503.94" dur="4.02">coordination how can we coordinate</text><text start="505.8" dur="3.48">better when decision making is</text><text start="507.96" dur="4.98">distributed and Leadership is</text><text start="509.28" dur="6.24">distributed ownership is distributed and</text><text start="512.94" dur="5.099">and I see the work I was doing with</text><text start="515.52" dur="4.139">impact networks as really a lot of the</text><text start="518.039" dur="3.961">the social layer and the social</text><text start="519.659" dur="3.541">Technologies of bring different groups</text><text start="522.0" dur="3.839">and communities together to get things</text><text start="523.2" dur="4.74">done and then you know Dows are really</text><text start="525.839" dur="6.12">pushing the envelope of any any other</text><text start="527.94" dur="6.42">space I see of what of the the trust</text><text start="531.959" dur="4.32">infrastructure or the the systems that</text><text start="534.36" dur="4.68">that allow us to coordinate at much much</text><text start="536.279" dur="5.101">larger scales Beyond which we can even</text><text start="539.04" dur="4.44">know each other or or form relationships</text><text start="541.38" dur="4.56">with one another and different tools and</text><text start="543.48" dur="5.16">mechanisms for doing that so uh of the</text><text start="545.94" dur="5.76">last couple years I&apos;ve gone all in on</text><text start="548.64" dur="4.68">web 3 space and and building Dows and we</text><text start="551.7" dur="3.06">can get more in to that but that&apos;s</text><text start="553.32" dur="5.1">that&apos;s the story of my progression</text><text start="554.76" dur="5.94">through impact Networks nice well um you</text><text start="558.42" dur="3.66">know I I have read the book impact</text><text start="560.7" dur="3.12">networks and we&apos;ll put a link in the</text><text start="562.08" dur="3.48">show notes we&apos;d recommend it to all of</text><text start="563.82" dur="3.66">our listeners</text><text start="565.56" dur="4.14">um because I think that</text><text start="567.48" dur="4.44">networks are just this unified basic</text><text start="569.7" dur="3.54">pattern of how we coordinate with each</text><text start="571.92" dur="3.96">other and by the way I love that you&apos;re</text><text start="573.24" dur="4.92">using my favorite buzzword coordination</text><text start="575.88" dur="4.44">um as we&apos;re talking about this</text><text start="578.16" dur="3.9">um it seems like</text><text start="580.32" dur="3.78">one of the things I wrote in my notes is</text><text start="582.06" dur="4.32">as I was as I was doing my research for</text><text start="584.1" dur="4.5">this is that impact networks are viable</text><text start="586.38" dur="3.6">approach when two conditions are met you</text><text start="588.6" dur="3.299">face a complex issue that you can&apos;t</text><text start="589.98" dur="3.78">solve on your own and you need to weave</text><text start="591.899" dur="3.781">greater levels of connectivity between</text><text start="593.76" dur="4.019">individuals or organizations to address</text><text start="595.68" dur="3.839">the issue so I&apos;ve always believed that</text><text start="597.779" dur="3.361">networks are great because they can</text><text start="599.519" dur="3.0">sense and respond and assimilate</text><text start="601.14" dur="3.72">information from the edge of the network</text><text start="602.519" dur="4.5">whereas a hierarchy top down like the</text><text start="604.86" dur="3.84">people who are in the trenches you you</text><text start="607.019" dur="4.021">kind of like don&apos;t care what they&apos;re</text><text start="608.7" dur="3.6">seeing on the front lines as much</text><text start="611.04" dur="2.76">um their hierarchies are good at</text><text start="612.3" dur="3.18">projecting power in One Direction</text><text start="613.8" dur="3.539">whereas networks are good at</text><text start="615.48" dur="3.359">assimilating information from a complex</text><text start="617.339" dur="3.541">issue</text><text start="618.839" dur="5.281">um and so for me that&apos;s like the</text><text start="620.88" dur="4.98">reductionist why of impact networks um</text><text start="624.12" dur="4.2">would love to get into like how how to</text><text start="625.86" dur="5.22">build a uh an impact network but I think</text><text start="628.32" dur="4.68">could we just synthesize a why before we</text><text start="631.08" dur="4.08">get into the what and how</text><text start="633.0" dur="4.98">I think you you said it well they&apos;re</text><text start="635.16" dur="4.5">they&apos;re good at different things uh when</text><text start="637.98" dur="4.08">we&apos;re faced with kind of simple or</text><text start="639.66" dur="4.44">complicated level problems hierarchies</text><text start="642.06" dur="4.62">are really good that&apos;s when we know</text><text start="644.1" dur="4.34">there&apos;s a beginning and an end we can</text><text start="646.68" dur="4.2">plan it all out in advance</text><text start="648.44" dur="4.899">relatively speaking something like you</text><text start="650.88" dur="5.639">know building a bridge or completing a</text><text start="653.339" dur="5.401">project there&apos;s prior examples uh we can</text><text start="656.519" dur="4.141">allocate allocate specific roles and</text><text start="658.74" dur="4.32">responsibilities to get things done and</text><text start="660.66" dur="5.359">execute execute right as you said focus</text><text start="663.06" dur="5.64">our energy on on executing a thing</text><text start="666.019" dur="5.021">networks are really good at addressing</text><text start="668.7" dur="4.56">complex level problems where there&apos;s not</text><text start="671.04" dur="6.32">a clear beginning or end when we&apos;re kind</text><text start="673.26" dur="7.62">of in this muck of uncertainty and</text><text start="677.36" dur="5.5">there&apos;s many different approaches that</text><text start="680.88" dur="4.44">we could take we need to learn our way</text><text start="682.86" dur="4.5">experiment our way through it as the</text><text start="685.32" dur="5.22">saying goes crossing the river by</text><text start="687.36" dur="6.12">feeling the stones when when we&apos;re faced</text><text start="690.54" dur="5.34">with with complex level problems there&apos;s</text><text start="693.48" dur="4.74">no single person no single organization</text><text start="695.88" dur="4.5">you can hold all that complexity by</text><text start="698.22" dur="4.14">themselves we&apos;re each just seeing one</text><text start="700.38" dur="3.48">slice of the picture all right we&apos;re</text><text start="702.36" dur="3.719">each holding just one piece of the</text><text start="703.86" dur="4.56">puzzle based on our experiences and the</text><text start="706.079" dur="4.741">the specific piece of the work that</text><text start="708.42" dur="4.08">we&apos;re focused on and so we need to bring</text><text start="710.82" dur="3.48">different perspectives together from</text><text start="712.5" dur="3.899">across the system and do some collective</text><text start="714.3" dur="4.74">sense making first of all just what&apos;s</text><text start="716.399" dur="5.221">what&apos;s going on where have we been where</text><text start="719.04" dur="4.919">we are where might we be going and then</text><text start="721.62" dur="4.56">start to find some alignment in that and</text><text start="723.959" dur="4.32">from that Collective sense making we can</text><text start="726.18" dur="4.2">identify some points of Leverage some</text><text start="728.279" dur="4.141">places where a small shift in one thing</text><text start="730.38" dur="4.68">could produce big changes throughout the</text><text start="732.42" dur="4.68">system and and start running experiments</text><text start="735.06" dur="3.48">around those and learning from those</text><text start="737.1" dur="3.359">experiments and sharing those learnings</text><text start="738.54" dur="5.22">across the system and continue to adapt</text><text start="740.459" dur="5.401">and evolve out of that we may may be</text><text start="743.76" dur="3.84">able to identify some discrete pieces of</text><text start="745.86" dur="3.78">work that fall back from the complex</text><text start="747.6" dur="4.2">into the complicated domain and that&apos;s</text><text start="749.64" dur="4.5">where we can then bring back structures</text><text start="751.8" dur="4.68">even hierarchies to the then go execute</text><text start="754.14" dur="4.259">on that and get things done the network</text><text start="756.48" dur="4.26">is really valuable in terms of engaging</text><text start="758.399" dur="5.0">large numbers of people in this complex</text><text start="760.74" dur="5.52">domain and finding our way through it</text><text start="763.399" dur="4.841">yeah I think one thing as we compare and</text><text start="766.26" dur="4.74">contrast hierarchies in networks we</text><text start="768.24" dur="4.56">could maybe note that a hierarchy is a</text><text start="771.0" dur="5.399">type of network but it&apos;s one where</text><text start="772.8" dur="6.12">orders flow down uh maybe resources flow</text><text start="776.399" dur="4.44">down and then actions actions flow back</text><text start="778.92" dur="4.44">in a network</text><text start="780.839" dur="4.981">can be like a superset of you could have</text><text start="783.36" dur="3.779">non-hierarchical networks also that are</text><text start="785.82" dur="3.18">more focused on connecting and</text><text start="787.139" dur="3.781">collaborating as opposed to commanding</text><text start="789.0" dur="4.2">and controlling so so that&apos;s a great</text><text start="790.92" dur="4.26">Point networks are hierarchies are also</text><text start="793.2" dur="3.24">kind of like a type of network also yeah</text><text start="795.18" dur="3.24">they&apos;re they&apos;re like a particularly</text><text start="796.44" dur="4.98">rigid type of network like a hub and</text><text start="798.42" dur="5.28">spoke Network where there&apos;s a single Hub</text><text start="801.42" dur="4.26">in the middle and then Spokes and nodes</text><text start="803.7" dur="3.42">that come out of that Hub and they only</text><text start="805.68" dur="3.48">connect to each other through that</text><text start="807.12" dur="4.32">Central Hub right that&apos;s the the top of</text><text start="809.16" dur="4.739">a hierarchy is the same as the the</text><text start="811.44" dur="3.899">center of a hub and spoke Network and we</text><text start="813.899" dur="3.841">have the same bottlenecks and issues</text><text start="815.339" dur="6.06">that arise so when we&apos;re building impact</text><text start="817.74" dur="5.58">networks or Dows it&apos;s moving beyond that</text><text start="821.399" dur="4.68">Hub and spoke stage and really creating</text><text start="823.32" dur="5.34">these multi-hub networks or these dense</text><text start="826.079" dur="5.341">core of activity and a large diverse</text><text start="828.66" dur="4.979">periphery of of individuals and actors</text><text start="831.42" dur="4.979">uh that that&apos;s much more fluid and not</text><text start="833.639" dur="4.981">not dependent on a single person or Hub</text><text start="836.399" dur="4.021">yeah and I&apos;ll just note that there&apos;s so</text><text start="838.62" dur="3.719">many beautiful diagrams in the book and</text><text start="840.42" dur="3.479">try to describe them it&apos;s one of those</text><text start="842.339" dur="3.601">pictures worth a thousand words things</text><text start="843.899" dur="3.301">if you look at the diagrams in the book</text><text start="845.94" dur="2.579">or</text><text start="847.2" dur="3.48">um you know I wrote this governance post</text><text start="848.519" dur="3.541">lessons about impact networks for dials</text><text start="850.68" dur="3.24">that we&apos;ll Link in the show notes also</text><text start="852.06" dur="3.719">you can really kind of see the density</text><text start="853.92" dur="4.08">of these networks and looking at them</text><text start="855.779" dur="3.781">visually I think helps helps to</text><text start="858.0" dur="3.54">articulate them</text><text start="859.56" dur="4.079">as well</text><text start="861.54" dur="3.9">I think I love your post I hope people</text><text start="863.639" dur="3.241">read your post if you don&apos;t read the</text><text start="865.44" dur="3.6">book just read that pose because it does</text><text start="866.88" dur="3.84">a great job summarizing and it it pulls</text><text start="869.04" dur="3.84">a lot of the images out of the book that</text><text start="870.72" dur="4.32">I was able to to offer up in open source</text><text start="872.88" dur="3.42">yeah I was thankful that those were</text><text start="875.04" dur="4.26">opens were so that I could share them</text><text start="876.3" dur="4.94">with Bitcoin though in that go Fest</text><text start="879.3" dur="4.08">um I&apos;m curious why you think so you know</text><text start="881.24" dur="4.0">uh for people who have studied the</text><text start="883.38" dur="4.68">history of human organization we know</text><text start="885.24" dur="4.74">about the formation of capital markets</text><text start="888.06" dur="3.839">the East India Corporation being

dur="3.841">are networks that are non-hierarchical</text><text start="904.199" dur="4.38">sort of resurgent does it have to do</text><text start="906.18" dur="3.48">with our networked Digital Way of</text><text start="908.579" dur="2.7">working or is there something</text><text start="909.66" dur="3.6">fundamentally different about the 21st</text><text start="911.279" dur="4.68">century that&apos;s more complex that makes</text><text start="913.26" dur="4.439">networks uh something that we need to</text><text start="915.959" dur="3.541">that we need to focus on like why</text><text start="917.699" dur="3.721">networks now it feels like everyone I</text><text start="919.5" dur="4.62">talk to is is upsets with network</text><text start="921.42" dur="4.14">apologies and and and that as an</text><text start="924.12" dur="3.3">organizing principle</text><text start="925.56" dur="4.38">yeah I think there&apos;s a few reasons you</text><text start="927.42" dur="4.44">spoke to a couple of them it&apos;s the the</text><text start="929.94" dur="4.62">level of complexity that we&apos;re dealing</text><text start="931.86" dur="5.159">with is bigger and bigger there&apos;s a as</text><text start="934.56" dur="4.079">tomatley has said uh things are getting</text><text start="937.019" dur="3.661">bigger and bigger better and better</text><text start="938.639" dur="4.021">worse and worse faster and faster and</text><text start="940.68" dur="4.38">bigger and bigger ways so this</text><text start="942.66" dur="4.859">complexity is growing and and with</text><text start="945.06" dur="4.5">complexity we we need better approaches</text><text start="947.519" dur="4.5">to address those levels complexity and</text><text start="949.56" dur="4.139">bring it back down to in that kind of</text><text start="952.019" dur="5.281">complicated domain where we can actually</text><text start="953.699" dur="6.061">then plan and and deliver uh hierarchy</text><text start="957.3" dur="4.26">is not very good at engaging complex</text><text start="959.76" dur="4.379">domains where we have to be really fluid</text><text start="961.56" dur="4.139">and adaptive and and connect really</text><text start="964.139" dur="3.121">different actors from really different</text><text start="965.699" dur="4.38">parts of the system</text><text start="967.26" dur="6.42">hierarchies are really good at planning</text><text start="970.079" dur="5.281">and executing they and so they&apos;ve</text><text start="973.68" dur="4.56">they&apos;ve evolved to address those types</text><text start="975.36" dur="5.219">of things and our education system you</text><text start="978.24" dur="4.02">know we&apos;re we have a specific curriculum</text><text start="980.579" dur="4.801">people are running through the</text><text start="982.26" dur="5.22">curriculum from point A to point B it&apos;s</text><text start="985.38" dur="4.98">pretty consistent obviously it&apos;s leading</text><text start="987.48" dur="4.26">to a lot of issues too but that&apos;s where</text><text start="990.36" dur="4.02">you know kind of that hierarchical</text><text start="991.74" dur="5.7">infrastructure can can make sense it&apos;s a</text><text start="994.38" dur="5.94">really consistent type of delivery but</text><text start="997.44" dur="4.74">but the world is changing so quickly uh</text><text start="1000.32" dur="3.3">the world is is so different now than it</text><text start="1002.18" dur="5.159">was six months ago</text><text start="1003.62" dur="7.38">so when we are organizing I think we&apos;re</text><text start="1007.339" dur="6.0">limited by a single power hierarchy we</text><text start="1011.0" dur="4.139">can still bring in the best of what</text><text start="1013.339" dur="4.321">hierarchies can do and this is what I</text><text start="1015.139" dur="4.741">hope we where we can get to with Dows is</text><text start="1017.66" dur="4.32">actually blending the best of networks</text><text start="1019.88" dur="3.84">and hierarchies because one isn&apos;t</text><text start="1021.98" dur="3.54">inherently better than the other they&apos;re</text><text start="1023.72" dur="3.9">just good at different things again</text><text start="1025.52" dur="4.919">hierarchies are really good at the point</text><text start="1027.62" dur="5.1">where we can plan and execute on a</text><text start="1030.439" dur="4.441">particular discrete thing or project or</text><text start="1032.72" dur="3.719">task networks are good at engaging large</text><text start="1034.88" dur="3.299">numbers of people and collectively sense</text><text start="1036.439" dur="3.421">making our way through it and so I think</text><text start="1038.179" dur="4.62">we can really actually blend both of</text><text start="1039.86" dur="4.62">those together why networks now also is</text><text start="1042.799" dur="3.841">because we&apos;re just I think naturally</text><text start="1044.48" dur="4.5">more connected across these different</text><text start="1046.64" dur="5.4">systems and geographies and silos and so</text><text start="1048.98" dur="4.74">we&apos;re seeing the and just so presently</text><text start="1052.04" dur="4.2">aware of the different interconnections</text><text start="1053.72" dur="4.02">of uh and how how all the different</text><text start="1056.24" dur="6.12">issues that we&apos;re facing are so</text><text start="1057.74" dur="6.6">interconnected and we can&apos;t do we can&apos;t</text><text start="1062.36" dur="4.5">create impact in a tiny little box</text><text start="1064.34" dur="5.1">because the the work that we&apos;re doing is</text><text start="1066.86" dur="5.34">affected and going to affect other</text><text start="1069.44" dur="5.099">issues in in pretty unknowable ways so</text><text start="1072.2" dur="5.04">we have to stay connected we have to be</text><text start="1074.539" dur="5.401">sharing this information and we have to</text><text start="1077.24" dur="4.38">be coordinating our efforts</text><text start="1079.94" dur="3.78">yeah</text><text start="1081.62" dur="3.84">yeah I mean it it feels like a</text><text start="1083.72" dur="4.02">fundamentally useful primitive and so</text><text start="1085.46" dur="6.38">like let&apos;s say you&apos;ve convinced me of of</text><text start="1087.74" dur="6.96">the why of networks as a frame um what</text><text start="1091.84" dur="4.839">tell me tell me how to build an impact</text><text start="1094.7" dur="4.14">Network tell me uh what I should know</text><text start="1096.679" dur="4.801">next about uh networks I see this the</text><text start="1098.84" dur="4.14">five C&apos;s that you&apos;ve put in there</text><text start="1101.48" dur="3.36">um you know what are the roles within a</text><text start="1102.98" dur="3.48">network

dur="4.68">yeah we can we can start there that if I</text><text start="1110.36" dur="4.14">see those those core activities these</text><text start="1112.82" dur="3.54">really just came from pattern</text><text start="1114.5" dur="3.84">recognition that you know these networks</text><text start="1116.36" dur="3.48">have been so different but but they&apos;re</text><text start="1118.34" dur="3.48">really consistent activities that keep</text><text start="1119.84" dur="3.42">showing up over and over again and these</text><text start="1121.82" dur="2.82">are not things that you check

dur="5.64">what is something that that aligns us</text><text start="1139.299" dur="5.62">and and then the principles are what are</text><text start="1142.88" dur="4.14">the values or the agreements

feel like very simple and</text><text start="1440.24" dur="3.6">there&apos;s a nice mnemonic of them being</text><text start="1441.799" dur="4.141">five C&apos;s right there but I think there&apos;s</text><text start="1443.84" dur="3.6">a lot of unpack with with each of these</text><text start="1445.94" dur="2.94">and probably a lot you learn as you</text><text start="1447.44" dur="5.219">iterate through doing those things over</text><text start="1448.88" dur="7.2">time yeah absolutely and it they are</text><text start="1452.659" dur="6.661">simple uh in concept right but really</text><text start="1456.08" dur="5.339">difficult in practice and and again it&apos;s</text><text start="1459.32" dur="3.599">it&apos;s not like you just go through that</text><text

forth and I think it&apos;s</text><text start="1476.48" dur="3.9">really important that uh Dows and</text><text start="1479.059" dur="3.12">networks and all types of organizations</text><text

dur="3.96">is our Focus here and what can we</text><text start="1513.799" dur="3.561">actually do and how can we execute on</text><text start="1515.48" dur="5.12">that so continually</text><text

that</text><text start="1541.46" dur="5.819">the more and more I get involved in in</text><text start="1543.799" dur="5.221">Dows it it feels like there&apos;s as much</text><text start="1547.279" dur="3.121">connective tissue to be built at the</text><text start="1549.02" dur="3.06">social layer as there is like</text><text start="1550.4" dur="3.779">programming our values into our money</text><text start="1552.08" dur="4.199">and it feels like a lot of these</text><text start="1554.179" dur="3.961">networks have their like hard and rigid</text><text start="1556.279" dur="4.561">governance principles that are</text><text start="1558.14" dur="4.86">programmed on chain or you know in a</text><text start="1560.84" dur="4.439">corporate charter if if if you&apos;re doing</text><text start="1563.0" dur="3.659">something that has a legal you know like</text><text start="1565.279" dur="3.961">a corporation</text><text start="1566.659" dur="5.161">um but it&apos;s it&apos;s really the culture and</text><text start="1569.24" dur="4.08">the social layer that is where a lot of</text><text start="1571.82" dur="3.959">the action happens and there&apos;s this</text><text start="1573.32" dur="4.38">there&apos;s this saying in networks that</text><text start="1575.779" dur="3.481">show me the incentive and I&apos;ll show you</text><text start="1577.7" dur="3.719">the outcome but I&apos;ve seen a lot of times</text><text start="1579.26" dur="3.539">in which the incentives are aligned and</text><text start="1581.419" dur="3.181">the outcome does not happen because</text><text start="1582.799" dur="3.12">people aren&apos;t coordinating and maybe</text><text start="1584.6" dur="3.0">where they&apos;re lacking trust or they</text><text start="1585.919" dur="3.721">don&apos;t have coordinated actions or they</text><text start="1587.6" dur="3.72">haven&apos;t been convened but it&apos;s been a</text><text start="1589.64" dur="3.06">real learning exercise for me going</text><text start="1591.32" dur="4.92">through the last Market cycle with</text><text start="1592.7" dur="5.94">Dallas to to to see how much of an art</text><text start="1596.24" dur="3.66">it is to to do this I&apos;m curious if</text><text start="1598.64" dur="5.159">you&apos;ve seen the same</text><text start="1599.9" dur="6.84">yeah I think you know I would ex explore</text><text start="1603.799" dur="4.62">the incentives piece you know maybe it</text><text start="1606.74" dur="3.0">feels like they&apos;re aligned because we&apos;re</text><text start="1608.419" dur="3.181">talking about you know Financial</text><text start="1609.74" dur="3.96">incentives and focusing on that but</text><text start="1611.6" dur="3.84">people are nuanced and they&apos;re really</text><text start="1613.7" dur="4.979">complex and we have a lot of different</text><text start="1615.44" dur="4.68">things that drive us uh it was the vast</text><text start="1618.679" dur="3.781">majority of the impact networks that</text><text start="1620.12" dur="5.4">I&apos;ve been involved with didn&apos;t have any</text><text start="1622.46" dur="5.339">direct Financial incentives but uh</text><text start="1625.52" dur="3.779">people kept coming back and they kept</text><text start="1627.799" dur="3.841">engaging and contributing their time</text><text start="1629.299" dur="4.801">because they got value in lots of other</text><text start="1631.64" dur="4.5">ways there was the social capital of</text><text start="1634.1" dur="4.98">course but then there&apos;s there&apos;s also the</text><text start="1636.14" dur="5.22">value coming back to their their</text><text start="1639.08" dur="4.68">personal learning the value to their</text><text start="1641.36" dur="4.26">organization the network actually helped</text><text start="1643.76" dur="3.96">them get things done that they wanted to</text><text start="1645.62" dur="4.02">achieve and it unlocked new</text><text start="1647.72" dur="5.04">possibilities for them so they weren&apos;t</text><text start="1649.64" dur="6.18">being involved because they were getting</text><text start="1652.76" dur="5.64">some kind of direct Financial return so</text><text start="1655.82" dur="5.04">by just looking at the financial</text><text start="1658.4" dur="4.379">incentive structure you would be</text><text start="1660.86" dur="3.24">wondering why people kept showing up and</text><text start="1662.779" dur="3.841">contributing so much time to these</text><text start="1664.1" dur="4.14">efforts but but I think it&apos;s because uh</text><text start="1666.62" dur="2.939">it&apos;s not just Financial incentives that</text><text start="1668.24" dur="3.78">drive us and sometimes those actually</text><text start="1669.559" dur="4.081">kind of corrupt uh the behavior of</text><text start="1672.02" dur="3.899">different actors and drawing the wrong</text><text start="1673.64" dur="4.98">wrong types of actors so I&apos;m really</text><text start="1675.919" dur="6.061">curious about how we can how we can</text><text start="1678.62" dur="4.439">blend that that social layer that you</text><text start="1681.98" dur="3.72">mentioned that we&apos;ve been talking about</text><text start="1683.059" dur="7.021">and then also the technological layer of</text><text start="1685.7" dur="5.04">the trustwear to to to be able to you</text><text start="1690.08" dur="3.78">know</text><text start="1690.74" dur="6.72">warm

engage many many more people</text><text start="1707.0" dur="6.48">and and retain the individual autonomy</text><text start="1711.08" dur="5.88">of actors to to be able to rage quit and</text><text

things</text><text start="1906.02" dur="5.159">done they often struggle unless those</text><text start="1908.72" dur="4.38">responsibilities are delegated to</text><text start="1911.179"

dur="4.86">responsibility and authority to empower</text><text start="1960.98" dur="4.26">individuals to get things done to make</text><text start="1963.44" dur="6.06">decisions without having to go through</text><text start="1965.24" dur="5.76">the consensus governance processes and a</text><text start="1969.5" dur="4.38">lot of times I&apos;m seeing delegation</text><text start="1971.0" dur="5.46">happening in very very broad ways where</text><text start="1973.88" dur="5.22">we&apos;re delegating decisions across all</text><text start="1976.46" dur="3.9">domains to a group of individuals I</text><text start="1979.1" dur="3.84">don&apos;t think that makes sense because</text><text start="1980.36" dur="4.74">people don&apos;t have the same context on</text><text start="1982.94" dur="4.2">each each decision or the same level of</text><text start="1985.1" dur="4.079">expertise on each decision we need to be</text><text start="1987.14" dur="4.68">able to delegate decisions and actions</text><text start="1989.179" dur="4.141">to individuals and teams that have high</text><text start="1991.82" dur="3.0">context and that are directly</text><text start="1993.32" dur="4.739">responsible for those and can be held</text><text start="1994.82" dur="6.32">accountable for those so hats protocol</text><text start="1998.059" dur="6.781">is a way to to delegate individual roles</text><text start="2001.14" dur="7.06">to to individuals and and bring it with</text><text start="2004.84" dur="5.28">it because we see we see roles as the</text><text start="2008.2" dur="4.44">basic unit of structure in an</text><text start="2010.12" dur="5.039">organization roles have been present</text><text start="2012.64" dur="4.8">throughout Generations in every form of</text><text start="2015.159" dur="4.981">human organization but roles are not</text><text start="2017.44" dur="5.28">very present in Dao&apos;s oddly enough and</text><text start="2020.14" dur="5.279">what do contributors need to to be able</text><text start="2022.72" dur="5.04">to contribute well they need any Clarity</text><text start="2025.419" dur="4.62">around what they&apos;re signing up for what</text><text start="2027.76" dur="4.5">they&apos;re responsible for they need the</text><text start="2030.039" dur="3.721">context the information they need around</text><text start="2032.26" dur="3.299">that they need the associated</text><text start="2033.76" dur="3.96">authorities and permissions so it</text><text start="2035.559" dur="5.821">unlocks the the different applications</text><text start="2037.72" dur="6.179">and and other platforms they need to do</text><text start="2041.38" dur="4.56">their work and then the accountabilities</text><text start="2043.899" dur="3.66">which goes both ways how can the</text><text start="2045.94" dur="2.939">collective hold the individual</text><text start="2047.559" dur="3.6">accountable doing what they say they&apos;re</text><text start="2048.879" dur="4.441">going to do and how can the individual</text><text start="2051.159" dur="3.72">be sure that the collective is is going</text><text start="2053.32" dur="4.319">to provide them with the compensation</text><text start="2054.879" dur="5.401">that that was agreed upon oh well the</text><text start="2057.639" dur="5.341">structure that doesn&apos;t have a single</text><text start="2060.28" dur="4.74">person at the top but the organization</text><text start="2062.98" dur="3.78">as a whole the Dow as a whole holds the</text><text start="2065.02" dur="3.96">ultimate Authority but we can still</text><text start="2066.76" dur="4.619">co-create these structures to get things</text><text start="2068.98" dur="6.3">done when needed</text><text start="2071.379" dur="7.681">yeah I gotta say that um</text><text start="2075.28" dur="6.0">I think hats protocol is mimetically one</text><text start="2079.06" dur="4.5">of the best named protocols that I think</text><text start="2081.28" dur="5.579">I&apos;ve seen out there</text><text start="2083.56" dur="5.76">thank you that hats hats uh I don&apos;t</text><text start="2086.859" dur="5.101">think we&apos;re on video but uh you know</text><text start="2089.32" dur="4.74">we&apos;ve the hats hats have have taken off</text><text start="2091.96" dur="4.02">pretty well and we&apos;ve wondered if we</text><text start="2094.06" dur="4.02">should just uh be partnering with meta</text><text start="2095.98" dur="6.24">Factory to do some interesting access</text><text start="2098.08" dur="6.18">control with actual hats but yeah well I</text><text start="2102.22" dur="4.02">just like the memetic</text><text start="2104.26" dur="4.26">the memetic value of oh I&apos;m going to</text><text start="2106.24" dur="3.96">wear this hat and it&apos;s the same as as</text><text start="2108.52" dur="4.14">getting a</text><text start="2110.2" dur="5.58">um a roll within a dow and having that</text><text start="2112.66" dur="5.52">easily revocable and modular uh within</text><text start="2115.78" dur="3.96">different pods and Dows yeah exactly and</text><text start="2118.18" dur="4.98">just just to explain that a little more</text><text start="2119.74" dur="6.78">so how it works is uh what we call a hat</text><text start="2123.16" dur="5.76">is an 1155 nft although it&apos;s</text><text start="2126.52" dur="4.38">non-transferable by the wearer it&apos;s</text><text start="2128.92" dur="6.78">transferable by the Dow itself and and</text><text start="2130.9" dur="6.959">so you can assign a hat at that nft with</text><text start="2135.7" dur="4.56">a few things you can assign it with a</text><text start="2137.859" dur="4.021">specific role and responsibility you can</text><text start="2140.26" dur="3.839">attach it to the different authorities</text><text start="2141.88" dur="5.459">or permissions that person would need to</text><text start="2144.099" dur="5.161">do that work and you can connect it with</text><text start="2147.339" dur="3.24">different accountability mechanisms and</text><text start="2149.26" dur="5.579">then you can also tie to specific</text><text start="2150.579" dur="6.181">eligibility criteria like what uh what</text><text start="2154.839" dur="3.421">tokens or badges or verifiable</text><text start="2156.76" dur="2.76">credentials the person has in their</text><text start="2158.26" dur="3.48">wallet are they eligible to wear that</text><text start="2159.52" dur="4.68">hat or or they&apos;re eligible to wear the</text><text start="2161.74" dur="5.4">hat as long as they retain a you know</text><text start="2164.2" dur="4.74">delegation threshold above X percent by</text><text start="2167.14" dur="4.14">A specific group of people you can embed</text><text start="2168.94" dur="4.38">your own custom logic and then you can</text><text start="2171.28" dur="4.319">also toggle the Hat on enough and a</text><text start="2173.32" dur="4.44">really nice piece of the architecture is</text><text start="2175.599" dur="4.621">that each hat can then create additional</text><text start="2177.76" dur="3.78">sub hats underneath it so you know as we</text><text start="2180.22" dur="3.18">delegate specific roles and</text><text start="2181.54" dur="4.98">responsibilities the people wearing</text><text start="2183.4" dur="5.04">those hats can can further delegate and</text><text start="2186.52" dur="3.839">break down those roles responsibilities</text><text start="2188.44" dur="3.84">they&apos;ll get them to other individuals to</text><text start="2190.359" dur="5.341">other teams and even other Dows I&apos;d</text><text start="2192.28" dur="5.88">really like to see uh this as a you know</text><text start="2195.7" dur="4.62">a mechanism for increasing actual</text><text start="2198.16" dur="4.8">coordination and even collaboration</text><text start="2200.32" dur="4.259">between different dials ecosystem</text><text start="2202.96" dur="2.82">instead of just within a specific</text><text start="2204.579" dur="3.481">organization</text><text start="2205.78" dur="4.74">right well yeah I mean uh the the the</text><text start="2208.06" dur="3.9">last of the five C&apos;s are cultivating</text><text start="2210.52" dur="4.26">trust coordinating action and</text><text start="2211.96" dur="5.28">collaborating for systems change so it</text><text start="2214.78" dur="3.78">feels like your journey now with Hats</text><text start="2217.24" dur="3.599">protocol</text><text start="2218.56" dur="4.68">is a continuation of the impact Network</text><text start="2220.839" dur="4.861">stuff that you&apos;ve done in the past yeah</text><text start="2223.24" dur="3.839">totally it&apos;s definitely directly evolved</text><text start="2225.7" dur="2.879">out of that and</text><text start="2227.079" dur="3.0">um it&apos;s something that you know the</text><text start="2228.579" dur="4.681">networks that that I&apos;ve been involved in</text><text start="2230.079" dur="5.52">would really need they need better role</text><text start="2233.26" dur="3.72">Clarity you know again basically we can</text><text start="2235.599" dur="4.26">start at a high level and bring people</text><text start="2236.98" dur="4.74">together to to to identify specific</text><text start="2239.859" dur="3.841">needs and and specific things we can</text><text start="2241.72" dur="3.899">execute on but then when we get to that</text><text start="2243.7" dur="5.04">level that&apos;s where we can really add in</text><text start="2245.619" dur="4.801">more structure and and we can delegate</text><text start="2248.74" dur="4.56">more specific roles and responsibilities</text><text start="2250.42" dur="4.86">to go get things done ultimately people</text><text start="2253.3" dur="4.08">are the ones who go execute on work I</text><text start="2255.28" dur="4.02">think we can think and plan really well</text><text start="2257.38" dur="3.9">in groups and teams but we need to be</text><text start="2259.3" dur="3.6">able to to delegate authority to to</text><text start="2261.28" dur="3.72">individuals and Empower them to get</text><text start="2262.9" dur="4.38">things done well um you know I&apos;ve got a</text><text start="2265.0" dur="3.78">couple another uh things in my notes</text><text start="2267.28" dur="3.9">that we could go through principles of</text><text start="2268.78" dur="4.5">network leadership uh different types of</text><text start="2271.18" dur="3.78">network leader roles</text><text start="2273.28" dur="3.68">um the dynamic tensions that exist in</text><text start="2274.96" dur="4.8">Impact networks are interesting to me</text><text start="2276.96" dur="4.48">and would love to to go down that that</text><text start="2279.76" dur="3.599">but you know I&apos;m curious if there&apos;s</text><text start="2281.44" dur="4.38">anything that I didn&apos;t ask you that that</text><text start="2283.359" dur="4.081">you want to say uh you kind of Choose</text><text start="2285.82" dur="3.9">Your Own Adventure for the remaining 15</text><text start="2287.44" dur="6.179">minutes of the episode</text><text start="2289.72" dur="4.98">oh man well I&apos;d actually uh I want to</text><text start="2293.619" dur="2.941">hear your thoughts on a million things</text><text start="2294.7" dur="3.3">but this is your podcast so people can</text><text start="2296.56" dur="4.26">already go listen to all that other</text><text start="2298.0" dur="4.92">stuff but uh I I think leadership is one</text><text start="2300.82" dur="3.66">thing that I want to touch on</text><text start="2302.92" dur="3.36">um and I&apos;d love to hear your thoughts on</text><text start="2304.48" dur="4.98">leadership in this context as well</text><text start="2306.28" dur="6.18">because it&apos;s my belief that leadership</text><text start="2309.46" dur="5.46">always matters it matters so much it&apos;s</text><text start="2312.46" dur="3.72">just especially in in collaborative</text><text start="2314.92" dur="2.82">context it&apos;s just a really different</text><text start="2316.18" dur="4.2">form of leadership than we see in</text><text start="2317.74" dur="4.98">hierarchical environments and you know I</text><text start="2320.38" dur="5.28">see a lot of times in in collaborative</text><text start="2322.72" dur="6.3">groups and even in small uh working</text><text start="2325.66" dur="6.419">groups people are hesitant to kind of go</text><text start="2329.02" dur="7.26">forward and and take take leadership and</text><text start="2332.079" dur="6.241">and show direction and uh and but it&apos;s</text><text start="2336.28" dur="5.7">it&apos;s leadership that&apos;s not directive</text><text start="2338.32" dur="5.82">it&apos;s it&apos;s really facilitative right it&apos;s</text><text start="2341.98" dur="4.26">a leadership that isn&apos;t about telling</text><text start="2344.14" dur="4.979">people what to do but it&apos;s creating the</text><text start="2346.24" dur="4.8">conditions for self-organization to</text><text start="2349.119" dur="3.561">support people to discover what they can</text><text start="2351.04" dur="4.62">and want to do together and then helping</text><text start="2352.68" dur="5.26">keep uh things coordinated together</text><text start="2355.66" dur="5.04">there&apos;s there&apos;s a few different key</text><text start="2357.94" dur="4.86">roles of of network leaders that I&apos;ve</text><text start="2360.7" dur="5.24">I&apos;ve seen I love to get your thoughts on</text><text start="2362.8" dur="5.4">this one is catalyzing I&apos;ve actually</text><text start="2365.94" dur="4.78">bringing people together for the first</text><text start="2368.2" dur="4.98">time or catalyzing a new project or</text><text start="2370.72" dur="5.04">catalyzing a new conversation starting</text><text start="2373.18" dur="4.679">things right the second is facilitating</text><text start="2375.76" dur="4.2">okay so then when people are there</text><text start="2377.859" dur="3.601">together in space or Community or team</text><text start="2379.96" dur="3.659">how do we actually combine these</text><text start="2381.46" dur="6.42">different perspectives to reach an</text><text start="2383.619" dur="6.181">outcome third is weaving how do we see</text><text start="2387.88" dur="4.92">the the structure of relationships that</text><text start="2389.8" dur="4.799">exist across the system and improve the</text><text start="2392.8" dur="4.86">the webs of connections between them so</text><text start="2394.599" dur="5.041">that you know we reduce the points of</text><text start="2397.66" dur="4.26">fragility that are dependent on a really</text><text start="2399.64" dur="3.6">narrow bridge dependent on two people</text><text start="2401.92" dur="3.14">connecting different parts of the system</text><text start="2403.24" dur="4.44">together how do we actually</text><text start="2405.06" dur="4.24">notice when people could support each</text><text start="2407.68" dur="3.48">other&apos;s work and then go the extra mile</text><text start="2409.3" dur="4.799">to actually connect them together and</text><text start="2411.16" dur="4.62">and share that context and then fourth</text><text start="2414.099" dur="3.541">coordination which is a lot of the back</text><text start="2415.78" dur="4.319">of the house kind of setting up the</text><text start="2417.64" dur="4.08">infrastructure providing structures that</text><text start="2420.099" dur="4.621">are really fit for purpose and building</text><text start="2421.72" dur="6.359">you know just enough structure at in</text><text start="2424.72" dur="7.08">order to to fit the needs not over</text><text start="2428.079" dur="6.361">structuring not defining rigid rules</text><text start="2431.8" dur="5.46">well in advance but really building the</text><text start="2434.44" dur="5.22">structure as we go kind of like as a</text><text start="2437.26" dur="4.56">garden starts to develop providing you</text><text start="2439.66" dur="4.199">know Stakes or trellises that the plants</text><text start="2441.82" dur="3.6">can hang on to you&apos;re not directing</text><text start="2443.859" dur="4.201">their path exactly but you&apos;re giving</text><text start="2445.42" dur="4.26">them the support they need to grow I&apos;m</text><text start="2448.06" dur="2.7">curious your thoughts what are what do</text><text start="2449.68" dur="3.36">you see in terms of what does good</text><text start="2450.76" dur="3.48">leadership look like in in Dows or in</text><text start="2453.04" dur="2.579">these types of collaborative</text><text start="2454.24" dur="4.14">environments</text><text start="2455.619" dur="4.141">yeah that&apos;s a really great question you</text><text start="2458.38" dur="3.239">know I think you&apos;ve identified a lot of</text><text start="2459.76" dur="5.16">dynamic tensions there and I wish that</text><text start="2461.619" dur="5.881">there was uh been the engineer in the</text><text start="2464.92" dur="4.86">wishes there was like a formula that you</text><text start="2467.5" dur="4.32">could just follow and and you would get</text><text start="2469.78" dur="3.6">there but uh you know a lot of this</text><text start="2471.82" dur="3.539">stuff with the dynamic tension feels</text><text start="2473.38" dur="4.739">like finding a middle way between</text><text start="2475.359" dur="6.0">different routes and and I think that</text><text start="2478.119" dur="4.74">that&apos;s the challenge of of web3 and in</text><text start="2481.359" dur="3.061">you know you kind of have to accept that</text><text start="2482.859" dur="3.601">when you get into web three like if I</text><text start="2484.42" dur="4.679">was in web 2 the playbook for web 2</text><text start="2486.46" dur="4.74">entrepreneurship is pretty well trotted</text><text start="2489.099" dur="3.661">like you just you just either get as</text><text start="2491.2" dur="3.6">many eyeballs as possible and sell as</text><text start="2492.76" dur="5.72">many ads as possible</text><text start="2494.8" dur="6.96">um or you have a subscription model and</text><text start="2498.48" dur="5.74">you uh get as many subscribers as you</text><text start="2501.76" dur="4.26">can you minimize the cost per uh</text><text start="2504.22" dur="3.48">acquisition and you increase the</text><text start="2506.02" dur="3.48">lifetime value of each subscriber and</text><text start="2507.7" dur="2.82">then you sell to Google for 150 million</text><text start="2509.5" dur="3.3">dollars or something like that it was</text><text start="2510.52" dur="4.44">like the web 2 model and with Dallas</text><text start="2512.8" dur="6.12">it&apos;s it&apos;s much more of a complicated and</text><text start="2514.96" dur="5.52">dimensional design space and and I and I</text><text start="2518.92" dur="3.96">think that you know we&apos;re still trying</text><text start="2520.48" dur="4.379">to figure out our path forward in a</text><text start="2522.88" dur="5.219">dial-based world but you know one thing</text><text start="2524.859" dur="5.22">that that I think that uh I&apos;ve been</text><text start="2528.099" dur="5.461">diverging so maybe I&apos;ll try to converge</text><text start="2530.079" dur="5.881">on on uh on on one thing and and that&apos;s</text><text start="2533.56" dur="6.9">um from my position one area I found</text><text start="2535.96" dur="6.72">that I&apos;ve been able to do is is try to</text><text start="2540.46" dur="4.86">create Clarity</text><text start="2542.68" dur="4.919">um and especially across different</text><text start="2545.32" dur="4.2">domains so</text><text start="2547.599" dur="2.941">um you know you know like back when I</text><text start="2549.52" dur="2.22">was at Bitcoin like I&apos;ve since</text><text start="2550.54" dur="3.539">disaffiliated from Bitcoin Dallas</text><text start="2551.74" dur="4.2">leadership and but like back when I was</text><text start="2554.079" dur="4.441">still at coin dial like because I was</text><text start="2555.94" dur="5.46">the founder I understood the engineering</text><text start="2558.52" dur="4.5">and the product and the marketing and</text><text start="2561.4" dur="3.78">and being able to create that</text><text start="2563.02" dur="4.2">cooperation across</text><text start="2565.18" dur="4.679">um across those two things I think was</text><text start="2567.22" dur="3.24">really really important for</text><text start="2569.859" dur="2.401">um</text><text start="2570.46" dur="3.3">like just so that they understood each</text><text start="2572.26" dur="3.839">other so that they could talk to each</text><text start="2573.76" dur="5.099">other and as long if you can drive for</text><text start="2576.099" dur="5.101">clarity that everyone knows the shared</text><text start="2578.859" dur="5.701">objectives and the mission and the</text><text start="2581.2" dur="5.28">considerations across uh the design</text><text start="2584.56" dur="4.92">space I think that that is one thing</text><text start="2586.48" dur="6.119">that I would love to see in more Dows uh</text><text start="2589.48" dur="4.379">and especially you know get coined out</text><text start="2592.599" dur="2.821">um quadratic funding is a little bit</text><text start="2593.859" dur="5.161">complicated and that&apos;s what bitcoin&apos;s</text><text start="2595.42" dur="5.82">core product is so uh yeah I don&apos;t know</text><text start="2599.02" dur="3.839">it&apos;s a very end dimensional design space</text><text start="2601.24" dur="3.78">but that&apos;s at least one direction that</text><text start="2602.859" dur="4.74">you could go yeah I totally agree with</text><text start="2605.02" dur="4.74">that I think it so valuable to have the</text><text start="2607.599" dur="4.02">people who are capturing information</text><text start="2609.76" dur="3.599">from different parts of the system and</text><text start="2611.619" dur="4.621">then helping synthesize it and get that</text><text start="2613.359" dur="6.48">information to to where it&apos;s needed like</text><text start="2616.24" dur="5.52">in back in uh web 2 company I was part</text><text start="2619.839" dur="3.841">of the knowledge management team and</text><text start="2621.76" dur="4.859">that was very different that was like</text><text start="2623.68" dur="4.56">logging the the learnings and the data</text><text start="2626.619" dur="4.681">and putting it into a database that</text><text start="2628.24" dur="4.98">nobody read really what we need is is</text><text start="2631.3" dur="3.18">people to go out and talk to the</text><text start="2633.22" dur="2.58">different working groups talk to the</text><text start="2634.48" dur="3.06">different parts of the system understand</text><text start="2635.8" dur="3.48">what&apos;s happening and then help to</text><text start="2637.54" dur="4.26">facilitate the flow of information and</text><text start="2639.28" dur="5.1">and then resources so they get from the</text><text start="2641.8" dur="4.68">right place to the right place uh the I</text><text start="2644.38" dur="4.62">like to that you keep bringing up the</text><text start="2646.48" dur="5.22">attentions piece I think that&apos;s such a</text><text start="2649.0" dur="4.56">key role here is is holding tensions and</text><text start="2651.7" dur="4.68">and being aware of the different</text><text start="2653.56" dur="5.519">tensions that exist tensions like you</text><text start="2656.38" dur="4.86">know should we do X or Y that&apos;s a clear</text><text start="2659.079" dur="3.481">tension but that that it&apos;s a really</text><text start="2661.24" dur="4.68">clear choice but a lot of tensions</text><text start="2662.56" dur="6.42">there&apos;s no right answer right it&apos;s</text><text start="2665.92" dur="5.22">should we take the time to to cultivate</text><text start="2668.98" dur="4.2">the the community and strengthen the</text><text start="2671.14" dur="4.26">floater information or or should we take</text><text start="2673.18" dur="5.46">the time to go execute and take action</text><text start="2675.4" dur="6.0">that trust that that tension of building</text><text start="2678.64" dur="6.959">trust and taking action is so present</text><text start="2681.4" dur="7.439">and both are important and how do we you</text><text start="2685.599" dur="5.581">know uh emphasize one in in certain</text><text start="2688.839" dur="4.26">areas and another in different areas uh</text><text start="2691.18" dur="6.419">tensions too around participation and</text><text start="2693.099" dur="7.321">Pace like engaging more people uh but</text><text start="2697.599" dur="5.701">then that might limit Us in terms of the</text><text start="2700.42" dur="4.439">pace of decision making uh tensions in</text><text start="2703.3" dur="5.1">terms of the only way that we can</text><text start="2704.859" dur="6.421">discover where we overlap and and what</text><text start="2708.4" dur="5.34">we agree on is by diverging and</text><text start="2711.28" dur="4.38">exploring the the many different</text><text start="2713.74" dur="3.48">perspectives that we have and the places</text><text start="2715.66" dur="3.6">where we disagree and we have to hold</text><text start="2717.22" dur="4.74">the tension through that discomfort and</text><text start="2719.26" dur="4.14">and that ambiguity until things start to</text><text start="2721.96" dur="3.06">converge again and we can see where</text><text start="2723.4" dur="3.78">there&apos;s where there&apos;s some alignment we</text><text start="2725.02" dur="4.68">can move on that and I think it is a</text><text start="2727.18" dur="3.899">huge role of of leaders to to be able to</text><text start="2729.7" dur="4.08">hold those tensions and to be able to</text><text start="2731.079" dur="4.861">name those tensions when they exist just</text><text start="2733.78" dur="4.2">naming them and and bringing them into</text><text start="2735.94" dur="3.96">awareness a lot of times helps people</text><text start="2737.98" dur="3.54">relax because we&apos;re feeling the</text><text start="2739.9" dur="3.719">temperature in the room rise when</text><text start="2741.52" dur="3.42">there&apos;s something going on we can&apos;t</text><text start="2743.619" dur="3.541">quite put our finger on it and when</text><text start="2744.94" dur="4.679">somebody names the tension that&apos;s taking</text><text start="2747.16" dur="4.98">place we can relax and we can start to</text><text start="2749.619" dur="4.261">actually thicker with through it</text><text start="2752.14" dur="3.24">yeah totally</text><text start="2753.88" dur="4.32">um and you know you would hope that in</text><text start="2755.38" dur="4.979">an honest uh well-meaning group of</text><text start="2758.2" dur="4.139">people that you could sort of manage</text><text start="2760.359" dur="3.181">those tensions together although it&apos;s</text><text start="2762.339" dur="3.0">always a little bit harder in practice</text><text start="2763.54" dur="5.64">than it is in theory</text><text start="2765.339" dur="6.661">yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s not easy to to engage in</text><text start="2769.18" dur="5.88">in conflict or disagreement and that&apos;s</text><text start="2772.0" dur="4.98">where it is really valuable to you know</text><text start="2775.06" dur="3.42">the the cultivating trust piece is is</text><text start="2776.98" dur="4.26">really about like</text><text start="2778.48" dur="5.339">it&apos;s it&apos;s so valuable to take the time</text><text start="2781.24" dur="6.96">to go slow initially so that we can go</text><text start="2783.819" dur="6.961">faster later to to build up some shared</text><text start="2788.2" dur="5.52">awareness of each other&apos;s perspectives</text><text start="2790.78" dur="5.579">uh the why that&apos;s bringing us here of</text><text start="2793.72" dur="4.16">our constraints uh you know what&apos;s</text><text start="2796.359" dur="6.421">limiting in US</text><text start="2797.88" dur="8.32">and and and and also our you know our</text><text start="2802.78" dur="5.64">personal incentives or the the people</text><text start="2806.2" dur="5.159">that we are accountable to and so forth</text><text start="2808.42" dur="4.86">Just understanding more about uh more</text><text start="2811.359" dur="4.26">about each other&apos;s context not just the</text><text start="2813.28" dur="4.14">the external context the things we we</text><text start="2815.619" dur="3.541">see and can infer about each other but</text><text start="2817.42" dur="4.8">the internal context what&apos;s actually</text><text start="2819.16" dur="5.76">going on what you&apos;re underlying uh</text><text start="2822.22" dur="4.5">beliefs and motivations we take it</text><text start="2824.92" dur="6.199">doesn&apos;t take that long but if we take</text><text start="2826.72" dur="8.28">some time to to be in that space first</text><text start="2831.119" dur="5.921">it really uh facilitates the the</text><text start="2835.0" dur="4.44">conversations about the places where we</text><text start="2837.04" dur="4.26">disagree because we have a foundation of</text><text start="2839.44" dur="3.54">maybe not trust yet but at least</text><text start="2841.3" dur="4.38">Goodwill or at least shared</text><text start="2842.98" dur="5.46">understanding uh so that we can hold in</text><text start="2845.68" dur="6.54">that that more challenging space of the</text><text start="2848.44" dur="7.139">places where we disagree and uh and so I</text><text start="2852.22" dur="5.7">I really encourage people to to don&apos;t</text><text start="2855.579" dur="5.04">jump straight into action</text><text start="2857.92" dur="6.06">take a little bit of time to go slow</text><text start="2860.619" dur="4.74">initially to to build the the webs of</text><text start="2863.98" dur="3.24">relationships build the direct</text><text start="2865.359" dur="4.801">connections between people and and</text><text start="2867.22" dur="4.74">understanding uh the the commonalities</text><text start="2870.16" dur="4.439">in terms of motivations and values</text><text start="2871.96" dur="3.899">between people uh and because then the</text><text start="2874.599" dur="3.061">action that you take is going to be that</text><text start="2875.859" dur="3.781">much more fruitful</text><text start="2877.66" dur="4.08">well unfortunately uh we&apos;ve got another</text><text start="2879.64" dur="3.959">Dynamic tension uh this being a really</text><text start="2881.74" dur="4.5">interesting design space but also a very</text><text start="2883.599"
