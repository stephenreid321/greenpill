how&apos;s it going thanks for</text><text start="10.139" dur="5.04">having us</text><text start="12.179" dur="4.081">yeah very glad to have you so uh I think</text><text start="15.179" dur="2.581">that block science is at the</text><text start="16.26" dur="3.0">intersection of a lot of green pill</text><text start="17.76" dur="4.5">stuff a lot of the stuff that we did at</text><text start="19.26" dur="5.34">git coin involved block science and</text><text start="22.26" dur="3.84">let&apos;s just let&apos;s just tee off with with</text><text start="24.6" dur="2.519">what is block science and what do you</text><text start="26.1" dur="3.419">all do</text><text start="27.119" dur="6.001">I guess I&apos;ll start so uh block science</text><text start="29.519" dur="6.361">is a an engineering design like an</text><text start="33.12" dur="4.439">analysis sort of an r d company</text><text start="35.88" dur="3.6">um the cool thing about it is that we&apos;ve</text><text start="37.559" dur="3.961">grown it up pretty organically based on</text><text start="39.48" dur="3.96">what money we were able to make by</text><text start="41.52" dur="4.32">providing design and Analysis services</text><text start="43.44" dur="4.38">and through its growth we&apos;ve focused on</text><text start="45.84" dur="4.32">building it in a Cooperative way so</text><text start="47.82" dur="5.82">although it&apos;s initially formed as a</text><text start="50.16" dur="5.579">c-corp structure we&apos;re actively evolving</text><text start="53.64" dur="4.2">towards a more participatory governance</text><text start="55.739" dur="4.14">mechanism and and even eventually legal</text><text start="57.84" dur="3.359">structure changes</text><text start="59.879" dur="3.541">foreign</text><text start="61.199" dur="4.021">and maybe just to build on that a lot of</text><text start="63.42" dur="4.8">what block science does is</text><text start="65.22" dur="6.0">um complex engineering design analysis</text><text start="68.22" dur="6.18">and and so on so a lot of web3 enabled</text><text start="71.22" dur="5.52">systems um token ecosystems are sort of</text><text start="74.4" dur="3.539">complex adaptive systems that evolve</text><text start="76.74" dur="3.36">over time</text><text start="77.939" dur="2.941">um so while our our work doesn&apos;t</text><text start="80.1" dur="3.54">um</text><text start="80.88" dur="4.62">exclusively exist in the web 3 space I</text><text start="83.64" dur="5.1">think that&apos;s a really interesting new</text><text start="85.5" dur="5.28">application for complex engineering and</text><text start="88.74" dur="4.919">and how we can design more robust</text><text start="90.78" dur="5.58">resilience systems over time the complex</text><text start="93.659" dur="4.381">systems will terminology is sort of</text><text start="96.36" dur="3.84">proliferating and getting very popular</text><text start="98.04" dur="3.92">but it&apos;s often not something people</text><text start="100.2" dur="4.26">really understand Beyond a buzzword</text><text start="101.96" dur="4.479">generally complexity relates to things</text><text start="104.46" dur="3.72">being greater than the sum of their</text><text start="106.439" dur="3.241">parts not being able to necessarily</text><text start="108.18" dur="3.84">understand them from a single</text><text start="109.68" dur="4.2">perspective or by just breaking systems</text><text start="112.02" dur="3.779">down into their constituent elements and</text><text start="113.88" dur="3.48">understanding the elements so one of the</text><text start="115.799" dur="3.841">ways that block science has sort of</text><text start="117.36" dur="3.899">developed this complex systems expertise</text><text start="119.64" dur="4.5">is by drawing on a lot of different</text><text start="121.259" dur="6.241">fields so our sort of core senior</text><text start="124.14" dur="6.3">engineering team includes Danilo who&apos;s</text><text start="127.5" dur="5.04">an atmospheric physicist Jean Sheed</text><text start="130.44" dur="5.7">who&apos;s a computational economist David</text><text start="132.54" dur="5.64">Sisson who did his PhD in Neuroscience</text><text start="136.14" dur="3.66">but then did a whole career as a</text><text start="138.18" dur="3.96">software architect</text><text start="139.8" dur="5.34">um and this sort of breath of experience</text><text start="142.14" dur="5.64">is really plays into it actually not to</text><text start="145.14" dur="4.98">leave out Matt barlin who&apos;s a a naval</text><text start="147.78" dur="4.56">Architect by formal training who also</text><text start="150.12" dur="4.14">worked on sort of CAD softwares for ship</text><text start="152.34" dur="4.259">holes and like global scale Logistics</text><text start="154.26" dur="4.979">systems so like these people have these</text><text start="156.599" dur="4.441">experiences that are all different but</text><text start="159.239" dur="4.14">they have certain commonalities in the</text><text start="161.04" dur="6.66">way that we understand these big hairy</text><text start="163.379" dur="5.94">sort of complex ecosystems</text><text start="167.7" dur="3.179">cool so</text><text start="169.319" dur="3.06">um you know the reason I well there&apos;s</text><text start="170.879" dur="3.061">many reasons that I wanted to have you</text><text start="172.379" dur="4.681">on the Pod but one of the primary ones</text><text start="173.94" dur="4.26">is uh if we&apos;re going to re if we&apos;re</text><text start="177.06" dur="2.52">going to build regenerative crypto</text><text start="178.2" dur="3.66">economics if we&apos;re going to build a more</text><text start="179.58" dur="3.9">regenerative digital Frontier we&apos;re</text><text start="181.86" dur="3.68">going to have to work with complex</text><text start="183.48" dur="4.619">adaptive systems that evolve over time</text><text start="185.54" dur="4.419">and a problem well understood is half</text><text start="188.099" dur="3.841">solved uh insofar as you can understand</text><text start="189.959" dur="3.961">it so let&apos;s break that down complex</text><text start="191.94" dur="3.6">adaptive systems that evolve over time</text><text start="193.92" dur="2.88">complexity just means it&apos;s hard to</text><text start="195.54" dur="3.54">understand them and you have to break</text><text start="196.8" dur="3.78">them down into your elements uh into</text><text start="199.08" dur="2.76">their elements and draw on a lot of</text><text start="200.58" dur="4.26">different diverse fields in order to</text><text start="201.84" dur="6.0">solve them uh that&apos;s complexity adaptive</text><text start="204.84" dur="5.52">means that it evolves over time or that</text><text start="207.84" dur="4.619">it adapts over time I guess could you</text><text start="210.36" dur="5.28">break down the field or or sort of like</text><text start="212.459" dur="6.0">the problem set of sure adaptive systems</text><text start="215.64" dur="4.8">so they adapt over time is tricky</text><text start="218.459" dur="5.761">because it generally means that we have</text><text start="220.44" dur="5.76">multiple scales of adaptation so there</text><text start="224.22" dur="4.32">are sort of things that have a let&apos;s say</text><text start="226.2" dur="4.319">a highly automated very data operation</text><text start="228.54" dur="3.779">like a protocol that says if you do this</text><text start="230.519" dur="4.14">that happens that&apos;s like an immediate</text><text start="232.319" dur="4.441">kind of constant time scale but then</text><text start="234.659" dur="3.961">there&apos;s other time scales like maybe</text><text start="236.76" dur="4.74">there&apos;s daily cadences or monthly</text><text start="238.62" dur="5.699">cadences or even year over year cadences</text><text start="241.5" dur="5.819">that represent how that system changes</text><text start="244.319" dur="4.92">for example uh governance versus</text><text start="247.319" dur="4.14">operations so like you have like a</text><text start="249.239" dur="4.741">policy making decision in a Dao that</text><text start="251.459" dur="4.861">might change the way a particular</text><text start="253.98" dur="4.319">um I don&apos;t know contribution is measured</text><text start="256.32" dur="4.02">or rewarded but that&apos;s different from</text><text start="258.299" dur="4.981">saying hey we&apos;re actually fundamentally</text><text start="260.34" dur="5.46">amending the kind of uh stuff we do or</text><text start="263.28" dur="4.74">how we go about doing what we do which</text><text start="265.8" dur="4.26">is more governance oriented and then</text><text start="268.02" dur="4.56">even beyond that you might have the</text><text start="270.06" dur="4.139">emergence of new organizations or</text><text start="272.58" dur="3.54">relationships between organizations</text><text start="274.199" dur="4.861">which is like where the da Dao stuff</text><text start="276.12" dur="5.82">comes in and so you get these like</text><text start="279.06" dur="4.98">um temporal and spatial scales that are</text><text start="281.94" dur="4.02">spread out over um and in particular</text><text start="284.04" dur="5.159">over time here where you don&apos;t want to</text><text start="285.96" dur="5.34">muddle together things that are fast you</text><text start="289.199" dur="4.621">know instantaneous or day-to-day with</text><text start="291.3" dur="5.64">things that are better understood as um</text><text start="293.82" dur="5.4">sort of longer term incredible where</text><text start="296.94" dur="4.039">else could we go in understanding this</text><text start="299.22" dur="4.5">domain</text><text start="300.979" dur="4.78">uh for the for the time adaptation</text><text start="303.72" dur="4.02">domain I&apos;ve been putting a lot of effort</text><text start="305.759" dur="3.841">into understanding uh like</text><text start="307.74" dur="4.739">constitutional principles been working</text><text start="309.6" dur="5.52">with a guy named Eric Alston who&apos;s</text><text start="312.479" dur="3.961">actually also uh there in Boulder and</text><text start="315.12" dur="3.42">exploring</text><text start="316.44" dur="5.46">um the way that constitutional forms</text><text start="318.54" dur="6.659">create space for activities and so again</text><text start="321.9" dur="5.22">day-to-day activities happen within the</text><text start="325.199" dur="3.541">um within the rules or the constraints</text><text start="327.12" dur="3.6">that are set by these constitutional</text><text start="328.74" dur="5.459">paradigms and that but the</text><text start="330.72" dur="5.46">Constitutional structures are also</text><text start="334.199" dur="3.541">themselves often amendable on a much</text><text start="336.18" dur="5.04">slower time scale with a lot of friction</text><text start="337.74" dur="7.14">so that research has also crossed paths</text><text start="341.22" dur="5.22">with um Primavera de Felipe and is also</text><text start="344.88" dur="5.039">I&apos;ve done quite a bit of writing with</text><text start="346.44" dur="6.42">Kelsey Navin on the subjects of um sort</text><text start="349.919" dur="4.861">of Dao&apos;s as these kind of again complex</text><text start="352.86" dur="4.08">adaptive systems but with an emphasis on</text><text start="354.78" dur="3.78">how they change over time</text><text start="356.94" dur="4.08">um I don&apos;t know Jeff do you have uh</text><text start="358.56" dur="4.8">thoughts yeah I was just going to point</text><text start="361.02" dur="3.0">to sort of cyber physical systems in</text><text start="363.36" dur="2.58">general</text><text start="364.02" dur="3.3">um so cyber physical systems design is</text><text start="365.94" dur="4.5">any</text><text start="367.32" dur="4.26">um technological and social Innovation</text><text start="370.44" dur="2.699">like so</text><text start="371.58" dur="3.78">um international power grids for example</text><text start="373.139" dur="4.56">so power grids are always load balanced</text><text start="375.36" dur="3.6">which is tricky from an engineering</text><text start="377.699" dur="2.401">perspective because you need to make</text><text start="378.96" dur="3.06">sure that the amount of power being</text><text start="380.1" dur="3.719">produced is roughly equivalent to the</text><text start="382.02" dur="3.48">amount of power being used but then you</text><text start="383.819" dur="3.781">introduce of course people plugging in</text><text start="385.5" dur="3.539">stuff unplugging stuff they&apos;re</text><text start="387.6" dur="3.0">responding to different incentives in</text><text start="389.039" dur="3.481">the network maybe those are pricing</text><text start="390.6" dur="3.659">incentives where it&apos;s cheaper to use</text><text start="392.52" dur="3.72">when energy is more available and more</text><text start="394.259" dur="4.321">expensive to use when energy is less</text><text start="396.24" dur="5.28">available so you have all this sort of</text><text start="398.58" dur="5.04">adaptive Dynamic complexity in Real</text><text start="401.52" dur="4.32">World Systems and we just are basically</text><text start="403.62" dur="5.16">using those same you know control</text><text start="405.84" dur="4.56">theoretic tools and um you know load</text><text start="408.78" dur="4.74">balancing and all of that sort of</text><text start="410.4" dur="4.98">graceful failure etc etc from Real World</text><text start="413.52" dur="4.019">cyber physical systems and bringing them</text><text start="415.38" dur="4.259">into you know the the economic design</text><text start="417.539" dur="5.041">layer how can we design cyber physical</text><text start="419.639" dur="4.801">Commons um is you know one one area of</text><text start="422.58" dur="3.72">interest that we&apos;re that we&apos;re</text><text start="424.44" dur="4.979">researching currently</text><text start="426.3" dur="4.44">hmm I think what&apos;s interesting oh go</text><text start="429.419" dur="3.541">ahead zargum</text><text start="430.74" dur="6.299">I was gonna say that uh those cyber</text><text start="432.96" dur="5.7">physical systems um these sort of public</text><text start="437.039" dur="3.78">um public infrastructures are</text><text start="438.66" dur="4.92">essentially a kind of man-made public</text><text start="440.819" dur="4.741">good and so when we start to look at our</text><text start="443.58" dur="4.44">physical infrastructures that we rely in</text><text start="445.56" dur="4.62">rely on whether there are power grids or</text><text start="448.02" dur="4.44">our transportation networks or our our</text><text start="450.18" dur="4.32">inter our ISP networks which also</text><text start="452.46" dur="3.9">involve quite a lot of cables being laid</text><text start="454.5" dur="3.3">and sort of maintained in order to</text><text start="456.36" dur="3.42">provide you the experience of the</text><text start="457.8" dur="4.56">internet we&apos;re already looking at places</text><text start="459.78" dur="5.639">where where something is you know maybe</text><text start="462.36" dur="5.94">not quite a public good in so far as you</text><text start="465.419" dur="6.06">know you do have to say pay for</text><text start="468.3" dur="5.28">um the ISP the internet service you do</text><text start="471.479" dur="4.981">have some rivalrousness in the sense</text><text start="473.58" dur="5.28">that the the is a capacity constraint on</text><text start="476.46" dur="5.4">on those infrastructures so</text><text start="478.86" dur="4.8">um we might need a different notion from</text><text start="481.86" dur="3.239">quote public good because of the</text><text start="483.66" dur="4.08">rivalrousness</text><text start="485.099" dur="5.581">um and the potential excludability but</text><text start="487.74" dur="6.359">nonetheless we have this concept of um</text><text start="490.68" dur="5.579">communal resources that we produce and</text><text start="494.099" dur="4.5">maintain and all share and so I actually</text><text start="496.259" dur="5.34">think that this kind of mental model</text><text start="498.599" dur="5.461">around these infrastructures is a really</text><text start="501.599" dur="4.44">good one for reasoning about all sorts</text><text start="504.06" dur="4.8">of other digital infrastructures that we</text><text start="506.039" dur="4.801">are co-producing with the caveat that</text><text start="508.86" dur="4.739">some of these digital infrastructures</text><text

dur="5.58">Jeff was the idea of like hardness of</text><text start="643.62" dur="4.8">physical constraints uh kind of closes</text><text start="646.62" dur="3.24">the design space of complex adaptive</text><text start="648.42" dur="3.84">systems that evolve over time from being</text><text start="649.86" dur="3.9">so many different dimensions and it</text><text start="652.26" dur="3.12">collapses the design Space by adding</text><text start="653.76" dur="3.36">constraints at the front which maybe</text><text start="655.38" dur="3.6">shrinks the design space a little bit</text><text start="657.12" dur="4.2">and I&apos;m wondering if the if there&apos;s an</text><text start="658.98" dur="4.62">analog there with what you said zargum</text><text start="661.32" dur="4.079">about constitutions like if you add a</text><text start="663.6" dur="3.419">set of rules at the foundation of the</text><text start="665.399" dur="3.661">system it constrains the design space</text><text start="667.019" dur="4.921">and allows you to explore it faster is</text><text start="669.06" dur="4.5">there a Synergy between like the</text><text start="671.94" dur="3.0">hardness that comes from atoms and the</text><text start="673.56" dur="3.839">hardness that comes from constitutional</text><text start="674.94" dur="4.32">forms yes yeah I would say that there is</text><text start="677.399" dur="4.62">it&apos;s not perfect but we&apos;re creating</text><text start="679.26" dur="4.92">environments where we&apos;re imposing uh</text><text start="682.019" dur="4.801">what we often will call laws of motion</text><text start="684.18" dur="4.8">on these systems and in fact from a</text><text start="686.82" dur="4.259">methodological perspective some of the</text><text start="688.98" dur="4.14">best ways to get Reliable Properties is</text><text start="691.079" dur="4.38">to use energy functions so in much of</text><text start="693.12" dur="5.04">our mechanism design in order to</text><text start="695.459" dur="4.981">actually get to composable mechanisms</text><text start="698.16" dur="3.48">that preserve their properties and I&apos;m</text><text start="700.44" dur="2.88">again I&apos;m going to emphasize the</text><text start="701.64" dur="3.72">composability right because in web3</text><text start="703.32" dur="4.74">we&apos;re constantly Building Systems that</text><text start="705.36" dur="4.5">we can not we cannot guarantee that we</text><text start="708.06" dur="3.18">understand how they will be used in the</text><text start="709.86" dur="3.36">future because they&apos;re constantly being</text><text start="711.24" dur="3.839">composed with each other and the</text><text start="713.22" dur="4.679">physical world properties that make</text><text start="715.079" dur="5.401">composability work are basically energy</text><text start="717.899" dur="4.62">functions the the fact that if you have</text><text start="720.48" dur="4.74">a system that preserves a particularly</text><text start="722.519" dur="4.56">energy function like relationship in its</text><text start="725.22" dur="4.38">laws of motion then it doesn&apos;t matter</text><text start="727.079" dur="4.741">how you use that system what you combine</text><text start="729.6" dur="5.16">with it you can&apos;t break its internal</text><text start="731.82" dur="6.06">energy rules and so we use a lot of that</text><text start="734.76" dur="5.819">analogy in order to start to to both</text><text start="737.88" dur="4.92">design like establish requirements as</text><text start="740.579" dur="4.38">well as verify those requirements and as</text><text start="742.8" dur="5.159">you say sort of shrink the design Space</text><text start="744.959" dur="4.801">by asserting rules but the part of the</text><text start="747.959" dur="4.681">way that we make sure that those rules</text><text start="749.76" dur="5.699">stand up to composition is with um with</text><text start="752.64" dur="4.98">custom Notions of of energy for specific</text><text start="755.459" dur="4.681">systems</text><text start="757.62" dur="4.02">yeah and I really like the idea of you</text><text start="760.14" dur="3.9">know the quadratic lands because it</text><text start="761.64" dur="3.6">really gives an idea of like a space and</text><text start="764.04" dur="2.76">really what we&apos;re doing when we design</text><text start="765.24" dur="3.659">these economies is we&apos;re designing New</text><text start="766.8" dur="4.08">Economic spaces and if we don&apos;t design</text><text start="768.899" dur="4.68">the conservation rules properly someone</text><text start="770.88" dur="4.199">can just come in and and kick it and</text><text start="773.579" dur="4.681">break everything you know imagine</text><text start="775.079" dur="5.461">designing a skyscraper if</text><text start="778.26" dur="4.079">the the force of

that sense these constraints</text><text start="785.639" dur="3.781">making something</text><text start="787.5" dur="4.139">um you know reducing the dimensionality</text><text start="789.42" dur="4.74">is a way that we can get stability in</text><text start="791.639" dur="4.981">these systems and I think that&apos;s a</text><text start="794.16" dur="4.32">really interesting sort of paradox that</text><text start="796.62" dur="3.36">the constraint is actually what sets you</text><text start="798.48" dur="2.94">free</text><text start="799.98" dur="3.72">cool just wanted to add for the</text><text start="801.42" dur="5.28">listeners uh the quadratic lands is this</text><text start="803.7" dur="4.68">mythical land that uh was it mimetically</text><text start="806.7"

dur="4.36">infrastructure analogies and some of our</text><text start="834.3" dur="4.02">discussions here and I think another</text><text start="836.1" dur="4.08">concept that might be really helpful is</text><text start="838.32" dur="4.86">differentiating between A System&apos;s</text><text start="840.18" dur="4.92">properties and its implementation so</text><text start="843.18" dur="4.56">humans

start="851.639" dur="3.721">the properties that they experience I</text><text start="853.56" dur="4.38">like to use analogies of you know</text><text start="855.36" dur="4.26">plugging your phone into the wall you</text><text start="857.94" dur="4.019">don&apos;t think much about the grid hopping</text><text start="859.62" dur="4.62">in your car are and driving you know</text><text start="861.959" dur="3.661">with your kids to your to your parents</text><text start="864.24" dur="3.48">house to visit you don&apos;t think much</text><text start="865.62" dur="5.399">about the transportation system you know</text><text start="867.72" dur="4.739">you hot you log in and your computer is</text><text start="871.019" dur="3.181">connected to the internet and you really</text><text start="872.459" dur="3.781">don&apos;t think much about your ISP and</text><text start="874.2" dur="4.379">there&apos;s a lot of technical depth to the</text><text start="876.24" dur="4.86">the production and

the properties that humans care about</text><text start="885.36" dur="5.46">are their relative reliability stability</text><text start="887.94" dur="4.44">maybe fairness a sort of you know to</text><text start="890.82" dur="3.9">highlight the things like the net</text><text start="892.38" dur="4.74">neutrality discussion but but ultimately</text><text start="894.72" dur="4.919">these are not characteristics of the</text><text start="897.12" dur="5.339">implementation their their properties of</text><text start="899.639" dur="4.861">the complex potentially adaptive system</text><text start="902.459" dur="4.801">and that you want those properties to be</text><text start="904.5" dur="6.06">reliable so a big part of what we try to</text><text start="907.26" dur="6.54">do is apply historical engineering</text><text start="910.56" dur="5.7">methodologies to distinguish between the</text><text start="913.8" dur="5.58">the implementation and the properties</text><text start="916.26" dur="6.24">and to make the properties desirable and</text><text start="919.38" dur="5.84">and actually really stable reliable even</text><text start="922.5" dur="6.24">if the implementations themselves</text><text start="925.22" dur="6.7">end up varying over time or need</text><text start="928.74" dur="4.86">operations or governance to keep the</text><text start="931.92" dur="5.099">properties of Health</text><text start="933.6" dur="6.539">I would love to add a constraint to this</text><text start="937.019" dur="4.38">conversation and that is uh I&apos;m gonna do</text><text start="940.139" dur="3.0">that in the form of asking a question</text><text start="941.399" dur="4.261">which is</text><text start="943.139" dur="4.021">um actually applying some of this and</text><text start="945.66" dur="3.78">and the way I want to do that is through</text><text start="947.16" dur="4.859">storytelling uh in Bitcoin grants round</text><text start="949.44" dur="4.62">seven I came to you guys I was like help</text><text start="952.019" dur="4.081">we&apos;re being civil attacked quadratic</text><text start="954.06" dur="5.459">funding optimizes for the number of</text><text start="956.1" dur="6.239">people who fund a get coin Grant or a</text><text start="959.519" dur="4.26">CLR fund Grant or a giveth Grant and the</text><text start="962.339" dur="3.541">number of people instead of the amount</text><text start="963.779" dur="3.961">they they fund and because of that</text><text start="965.88" dur="3.3">there&apos;s a crypto economic incentive to</text><text start="967.74" dur="3.659">make up new identities and that&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="969.18" dur="3.54">called a civil attack problem and so I</text><text start="971.399" dur="3.361">came to block science and I was like hey</text><text start="972.72" dur="3.479">I have this complex system and I don&apos;t</text><text start="974.76" dur="3.6">want the bad guys to get the matching</text><text start="976.199" dur="5.221">pool money help</text><text start="978.36" dur="4.86">um and and and so you know tell us about</text><text start="981.42" dur="3.0">the the work that you designed there</text><text start="983.22" dur="3.359">tell us what you think about civil</text><text start="984.42" dur="4.5">resistant and uh I&apos;m adding this</text><text start="986.579" dur="4.32">constraint to to bring the design space</text><text start="988.92" dur="3.24">into a more tangible place that</text><text start="990.899" dur="3.421">hopefully people can understand through</text><text start="992.16" dur="3.84">storytelling so uh who wants to take a</text><text start="994.32" dur="4.079">swing at it</text><text start="996.0" dur="4.92">I I&apos;ll start and then I&apos;ll pass it off</text><text start="998.399" dur="4.8">to Jeff but first thing is you know</text><text start="1000.92" dur="3.9">civil attacks are</text><text start="1003.199" dur="3.961">um obviously like</text><text start="1004.82" dur="5.22">common in the internet in a world where</text><text start="1007.16" dur="4.979">pseudonymity is the basic notion of</text><text start="1010.04" dur="4.68">identity so you can have many identities</text><text start="1012.139" dur="5.101">by default and it&apos;s only in constrained</text><text start="1014.72" dur="4.32">spaces that&apos;s your sort of forced or</text><text start="1017.24" dur="2.94">bottlenecked down to have a single</text><text start="1019.04" dur="2.7">identity</text><text start="1020.18" dur="4.92">um and so it&apos;s not it wasn&apos;t really an</text><text start="1021.74" dur="6.36">intrinsic issue until you combined it</text><text start="1025.1" dur="5.76">with a mechanism that really expects a</text><text start="1028.1" dur="5.4">unique identity so quadratic funding is</text><text start="1030.86" dur="5.939">based on a a resource allocation</text><text start="1033.5" dur="6.78">principle that makes in its implicit</text><text start="1036.799" dur="6.241">Assumption of unique identity so once we</text><text start="1040.28" dur="5.76">had a look at the data and we found that</text><text start="1043.04" dur="5.58">there was this massive proliferation of</text><text start="1046.04" dur="5.7">what looked like bot Behavior we had to</text><text start="1048.62" dur="5.34">come up with a kind of classifier a way</text><text start="1051.74" dur="3.54">of saying that one looks fake that one</text><text start="1053.96" dur="3.42">looks real</text><text start="1055.28" dur="4.08">um with keeping in mind that this</text><text start="1057.38" dur="5.28">particular class of decision making</text><text start="1059.36" dur="5.819">algorithm falls into uh something not</text><text start="1062.66" dur="4.68">unlike a a court system like a guilt he</text><text start="1065.179" dur="4.921">not guilty where we don&apos;t actually know</text><text start="1067.34" dur="4.26">the ground truth so our decision ends up</text><text start="1070.1" dur="4.14">being the thing that it gets</text><text start="1071.6" dur="4.86">operationalized so the big part of what</text><text start="1074.24" dur="4.319">block science did on the first pass was</text><text start="1076.46" dur="4.92">really try to examine the data and talk</text><text start="1078.559" dur="4.821">to people different projects working on</text><text start="1081.38" dur="5.64">civil resistance like the bright ID team</text><text start="1083.38" dur="5.5">did some analysis as well and in the</text><text start="1087.02" dur="4.2">course of our discussions with them we</text><text start="1088.88" dur="4.5">started to scope out what it would mean</text><text start="1091.22" dur="4.94">to build machine learning algorithms</text><text start="1093.38" dur="6.9">that acted in complement with human</text><text start="1096.16" dur="7.0">reviewers to try to assign labels of</text><text start="1100.28" dur="5.46">Sybil not civil to the activity on the</text><text start="1103.16" dur="5.28">get coin platform in order to sort

dur="3.76">disproportionately and so</text><text start="1112.58" dur="3.36">um we can we can talk more about what</text><text start="1114.2" dur="4.32">specifically we did but the problem</text><text start="1115.94" dur="4.979">framing exercise like to figure out Okay</text><text start="1118.52" dur="4.68">Kevin called us up and said oh</text><text start="1120.919" dur="4.38">we&apos;ve got this issue what do we do you</text><text start="1123.2" dur="3.78">know we have to then start by by trying</text><text start="1125.299" dur="4.5">to understand it before we start trying</text><text start="1126.98" dur="4.5">to solve it and I think just just to</text><text start="1129.799" dur="3.541">complexify the problem a little bit more</text><text start="1131.48" dur="3.42">I think I also came to you after the</text><text start="1133.34" dur="3.54">Civil resistance conversation I was like</text><text start="1134.9" dur="3.42">oh there&apos;s also collusion attacks where</text><text start="1136.88" dur="2.659">people will sell their legitimate</text><text start="1138.32" dur="3.479">identities</text><text start="1139.539" dur="4.541">uh just to to make it a little bit</text><text start="1141.799" dur="4.74">harder on top of the Civil problem Jeff</text><text start="1144.08" dur="4.56">Jeff do you want to take a swing of this</text><text start="1146.539" dur="3.841">yeah definitely well actually I just</text><text start="1148.64" dur="4.38">wanted to you know give some Kudos and</text><text start="1150.38" dur="3.84">praise to the the get coin passport and</text><text start="1153.02" dur="2.76">I think there&apos;s a really interesting</text><text start="1154.22" dur="3.42">because you know what what ended up</text><text start="1155.78" dur="4.139">coming out of all of this was</text><text start="1157.64" dur="4.32">um sort of a composite of a bunch of</text><text start="1159.919" dur="4.441">different identity systems and you know</text><text start="1161.96" dur="3.599">with the uh for anyone who doesn&apos;t know</text><text start="1164.36" dur="4.439">how that worked it was you know</text><text start="1165.559" dur="5.761">essentially you could attest or or prove</text><text start="1168.799" dur="3.601">your identity on bright ID ideena</text><text start="1171.32" dur="2.7">Network</text><text start="1172.4" dur="3.24">um you know there are a number of</text><text start="1174.02" dur="4.14">different identity networks and you</text><text start="1175.64" dur="4.14">could get essentially a bonus multiplier</text><text start="1178.16" dur="3.78">on your</text><text start="1179.78" dur="4.74">um uh donations based on how many</text><text start="1181.94" dur="3.599">platforms you were verified on</text><text start="1184.52" dur="2.58">um and I think this is a really</text><text start="1185.539" dur="2.76">interesting way that we can compose</text><text start="1187.1" dur="3.66">different</text><text start="1188.299" dur="4.26">um web3 Primitives because each of those</text><text start="1190.76" dur="3.12">identity networks probably you know</text><text start="1192.559" dur="3.24">thought they were solving the problem</text><text start="1193.88" dur="3.96">all on their own but what you find</text><text start="1195.799" dur="3.541">oftentimes is that they&apos;re sort of</text><text start="1197.84" dur="3.48">solving for one</text><text start="1199.34" dur="4.68">um perspective on that or one one</text><text start="1201.32" dur="3.84">ecosystem so I really like the the get</text><text start="1204.02" dur="2.7">coin</text><text start="1205.16" dur="4.019">um product that ended up coming out of</text><text start="1206.72" dur="4.14">this is sort of a a measurement of a</text><text start="1209.179" dur="3.841">bunch of different identity networks to</text><text start="1210.86" dur="5.58">create an even stronger</text><text start="1213.02" dur="5.039">um simple Identity or symbol um uh</text><text start="1216.44" dur="3.72">prevention mechanism and then turn that</text><text start="1218.059" dur="4.261">around and offer that as a product to</text><text start="1220.16" dur="4.139">the larger web 3 ecosystem I think that</text><text start="1222.32" dur="4.26">speaks beautifully of the composability</text><text start="1224.299" dur="5.461">and the the power of these</text><text start="1226.58" dur="4.74">um I would say that identity is one of</text><text start="1229.76" dur="3.539">the hardest places to deal with</text><text start="1231.32" dur="5.219">composition right because just think</text><text start="1233.299" dur="5.88">about some specific cases I could use</text><text start="1236.539" dur="4.561">bright ID on one hand and like

well one we move</text><text start="1423.02" dur="4.019">away from this binary yes no</text><text start="1425.96" dur="2.52">um you know when we vote in</text><text start="1427.039" dur="3.361">representative democracy systems</text><text start="1428.48" dur="4.079">essentially we put a one and a couple of</text><text start="1430.4" dur="4.019">zeros into the system</text><text

dur="4.8">processing over just yes no</text><text start="1472.94" dur="3.78">um decision making</text><text start="1474.62" dur="4.02">if the governance design space is</text><text start="1476.72" dur="4.26">something that Dows are really opening</text><text start="1478.64" dur="4.68">up but we&apos;re still very focused on the</text><text start="1480.98" dur="4.38">procedures also so much of what you&apos;re</text><text start="1483.32" dur="4.859">describing can also take place in say</text><text start="1485.36" dur="6.179">deliberative processes and or less</text><text start="1488.179" dur="7.38">formal constructions so we&apos;re seeing uh</text><text start="1491.539" dur="6.12">on an undling of governance mechanisms</text><text start="1495.559" dur="4.041">and then giving people sort of our</text><text start="1497.659" dur="4.621">communities sort of a la carte</text><text start="1499.6" dur="6.04">Primitives to combine together to create</text><text start="1502.28"

things</text><text start="1508.76" dur="3.72">Clash a little bit so</text><text start="1510.86" dur="3.679">um the interesting thing that&apos;s going on</text><text start="1512.48" dur="4.62">right now is you see organizations</text><text start="1514.539" dur="4.841">configuring differently and then</text><text start="1517.1" dur="4.38">discovering how things work and then</text><text start="1519.38" dur="4.56">adjusting their internal decision making</text><text start="1521.48" dur="4.74">rules according to what they learned</text><text start="1523.94" dur="4.32">from trying to apply them</text><text start="1526.22" dur="4.74">um and Jeff I think one of the things</text><text start="1528.26" dur="5.1">that I like the most about your point</text><text start="1530.96" dur="4.56">about one person one vote is the the</text><text start="1533.36" dur="5.16">comments about you know only being able</text><text start="1535.52" dur="6.36">to say yes or no I think that there&apos;s so</text><text start="1538.52" dur="6.42">much room for both expressing intensity</text><text start="1541.88" dur="5.76">of preference and also just expressing</text><text start="1544.94" dur="5.28">new things that aren&apos;t easily put on a</text><text start="1547.64" dur="4.44">docket so having more openness about how</text><text start="1550.22" dur="4.02">things get onto it onto the list of</text><text start="1552.08" dur="4.02">things to be considered by the group how</text><text start="1554.24" dur="3.96">they get curated down to the things that</text><text start="1556.1" dur="3.9">are actively being considered because in</text><text start="1558.2" dur="4.62">much of our existing political process</text><text start="1560.0" dur="5.279">those processes are very hard to get</text><text start="1562.82" dur="4.82">involved in in a meaningful way and as a</text><text start="1565.279" dur="5.461">result most people only ever experience</text><text start="1567.64" dur="4.779">you know a choice that they want neither</text><text start="1570.74" dur="3.539">of and getting to a place where people</text><text start="1572.419" dur="4.26">are more enthusiastic about at least</text><text start="1574.279" dur="5.041">some of the choices put in front of them</text><text start="1576.679" dur="4.86">is a is a really good goal and that we</text><text start="1579.32" dur="3.3">can start by making this the case in our</text><text start="1581.539" dur="3.421">devs</text><text start="1582.62" dur="5.52">yeah I I think there&apos;s really a much</text><text start="1584.96" dur="5.339">larger space for participatory democracy</text><text start="1588.14" dur="3.24">using these kinds of emergent or</text><text start="1590.299" dur="2.941">bottom-up</text><text start="1591.38" dur="2.76">um signaling systems that are enabled by</text><text start="1593.24" dur="2.34">tokens</text><text start="1594.14" dur="3.419">um that we that we just don&apos;t really</text><text start="1595.58" dur="3.66">like it&apos;s not really in our Collective</text><text start="1597.559" dur="3.841">imagination because we&apos;re used to</text><text start="1599.24" dur="3.419">representative democracy</text><text start="1601.4" dur="3.48">um and I forget what I was reading</text><text start="1602.659" dur="4.321">recently but basically that like this is</text><text start="1604.88" dur="5.64">not democracy at all because we have</text><text start="1606.98" dur="5.22">almost no decision right before the vote</text><text start="1610.52" dur="3.899">um even after the vote you know maybe I</text><text start="1612.2" dur="3.78">voted for a politician who promised</text><text start="1614.419" dur="2.821">electoral reform</text><text start="1615.98" dur="3.12">um and then didn&apos;t deliver it three</text><text start="1617.24" dur="3.48">months later and now I&apos;m stuck with them</text><text start="1619.1" dur="3.48">for four years</text><text start="1620.72" dur="3.36">um you know even though they they didn&apos;t</text><text start="1622.58" dur="2.94">do what they said they would do so I</text><text start="1624.08" dur="3.959">think it&apos;s a really interesting new</text><text start="1625.52" dur="5.1">mechanisms to enable more</text><text start="1628.039" dur="4.441">um adaptiveness and responsiveness in</text><text start="1630.62" dur="3.799">terms of our our political systems and</text><text start="1632.48" dur="4.14">and how we make decisions collectively</text><text start="1634.419" dur="4.801">democracy in the context of complex</text><text start="1636.62" dur="5.58">adaptive systems is more about having</text><text start="1639.22" dur="4.959">meaningful feedback loops between the</text><text start="1642.2" dur="3.54">governed and the process that governs</text><text start="1644.179" dur="4.201">them and I think one of the biggest</text><text start="1645.74" dur="5.64">challenges is that we start putting the</text><text start="1648.38" dur="5.039">procedures or the rules in the role of</text><text start="1651.38" dur="4.02">hey as long as we follow this Democratic</text><text start="1653.419" dur="4.14">process we&apos;re Democratic and if the</text><text start="1655.4" dur="4.92">lived experience of the participants is</text><text

would be</text><text start="1663.799" dur="4.441">hard-pressed to call that democracy the</text><text start="1666.2" dur="4.2">interesting thing is the separation</text><text start="1668.24" dur="6.12">between the property and the lived</text><text start="1670.4" dur="6.42">experience of the constituent versus the</text><text start="1674.36" dur="4.38">um the definition or the Declaration of</text><text start="1676.82" dur="3.959">the mechanism and although crypto gives</text><text start="1678.74" dur="4.559">us a lot of mechanistic design space</text><text start="1680.779" dur="5.221">it&apos;s ultimately not about the mechanisms</text><text start="1683.299" dur="5.281">themselves it&apos;s about using them to</text><text start="1686.0" dur="5.659">create uh sort of a member experience</text><text start="1688.58" dur="5.16">that is truly enfranchising</text><text start="1691.659" dur="3.821">you know it reminds me a little bit of</text><text start="1693.74" dur="3.179">this famous quote about political</text><text start="1695.48" dur="3.36">philosophy that the consent of the</text><text start="1696.919" dur="4.201">governed is only the only basis for</text><text start="1698.84" dur="3.9">legitimacy of the actions of governments</text><text start="1701.12" dur="3.36">so as opposed to like the divine right</text><text start="1702.74" dur="3.72">of King where your moral right to rule</text><text start="1704.48" dur="3.48">comes from above comes from God the</text><text start="1706.46" dur="4.14">consent of the Govern kind of creates</text><text start="1707.96" dur="4.62">that closed loop where you can hopefully</text><text start="1710.6" dur="4.079">if you&apos;re doing it well create</text><text start="1712.58"

people</text><text start="1718.82" dur="7.099">you&apos;re you&apos;re governing actually happens</text><text start="1721.36" dur="4.559">so uh yeah</text><text start="1726.34" dur="4.42">that that piece of political philosophy</text><text start="1728.9" dur="3.3">is super relevant but I would go so far</text><text start="1730.76" dur="3.419">as to say it&apos;s about half of the</text><text start="1732.2" dur="5.04">equation you need the consent of the</text><text start="1734.179" dur="4.681">governed in so far as people feel uh</text><text start="1737.24" dur="4.319">that they&apos;re meaningfully being heard</text><text start="1738.86" dur="4.26">and that they&apos;re they have again that</text><text start="1741.559" dur="3.48">they&apos;re enfranchised in these

dur="4.5">where my mind went and you know maybe</text><text start="2471.579" dur="4.5">tokens can be used to do this to to</text><text start="2474.339" dur="4.141">Jeff&apos;s Point does that bring anything up</text><text start="2476.079" dur="4.561">for either of you yeah actually I mean</text><text start="2478.48" dur="4.32">there&apos;s a concept that I really like</text><text start="2480.64" dur="4.14">um called uh subsidiarity which I</text><text start="2482.8" dur="3.96">believe originally stems from the</text><text start="2484.78" dur="3.42">Catholic Church&apos;s Doctrine but it</text><text start="2486.76" dur="3.54">relates to pushing decision making</text><text start="2488.2" dur="4.26">Authority down to the lowest level it</text><text start="2490.3" dur="5.34">can go to but no lower it kind of</text><text start="2492.46" dur="5.399">distributes load in scale and so there</text><text start="2495.64" dur="4.08">are some things that are very local like</text><text start="2497.859" dur="4.74">maybe I&apos;m in a little working group with</text><text start="2499.72" dur="4.44">three people in a sub-door of a Dao and</text><text start="2502.599" dur="3.721">we&apos;re making decisions about something</text><text start="2504.16" dur="3.6">very operational in the context of that</text><text start="2506.32" dur="3.779">work and we&apos;ve had that Authority</text><text start="2507.76" dur="4.02">delegated to us but on the other hand</text><text start="2510.099" dur="3.661">there&apos;s going to be some decision making</text><text start="2511.78" dur="4.62">that might be</text><text start="2513.76" dur="5.04">um you know in that sub-dao or in that</text><text start="2516.4" dur="4.199">Dao or you know as I&apos;m moving up then</text><text start="2518.8" dur="3.66">some things are like the say it&apos;s on</text><text start="2520.599" dur="4.321">Main net so the ethereum you know</text><text start="2522.46" dur="4.619">protocol itself dictates a set of</text><text start="2524.92" dur="4.199">constraints on what we can do and then</text><text start="2527.079" dur="4.621">there&apos;s you know higher level things</text><text start="2529.119" dur="3.24">that might relate to</text><text start="2531.7" dur="3.06">um</text><text start="2532.359" dur="5.281">uh let&apos;s just say what we consider to be</text><text start="2534.76" dur="4.56">appropriate behavior period things that</text><text start="2537.64" dur="3.84">are maybe morally or ethically</text><text start="2539.32" dur="3.24">appropriate even if they&apos;re</text><text start="2541.48" dur="3.72">um you know</text><text start="2542.56" dur="5.279">not what even if they&apos;re within the</text><text start="2545.2" dur="4.68">scope of things you&apos;re able to do within</text><text start="2547.839" dur="3.301">any one of those rule systems and sorry</text><text start="2549.88" dur="4.08">that was a little bit rambly but the</text><text start="2551.14" dur="4.32">idea here is that there&apos;s decision</text><text start="2553.96" dur="3.72">making</text><text start="2555.46" dur="5.22">um that lives at every one of those</text><text start="2557.68" dur="4.98">scales concurrently and that what this</text><text start="2560.68" dur="4.159">some of this coherence comes from is</text><text start="2562.66" dur="4.98">sort of the really high level maybe</text><text start="2564.839" dur="5.201">principles that that help us determine</text><text start="2567.64" dur="4.26">you know what our values are you know</text><text start="2570.04" dur="3.9">what kinds of activities are morally or</text><text start="2571.9" dur="4.38">ethically appropriate</text><text start="2573.94" dur="3.96">um and that allows for coherence and if</text><text start="2576.28" dur="3.9">we go down one level we might get</text><text start="2577.9" dur="4.26">something like a networking protocol and</text><text start="2580.18" dur="4.86">if we go down another level we might get</text><text start="2582.16" dur="5.22">something that&apos;s like more contextual</text><text start="2585.04" dur="5.039">and thus further defined and the further</text><text start="2587.38" dur="4.86">you go down the more defined you get to</text><text start="2590.079" dur="4.26">your point about information though I</text><text start="2592.24" dur="4.68">think it is very interesting when things</text><text start="2594.339" dur="4.801">that are distant in that graph end up</text><text start="2596.92" dur="4.62">having similarities and then sort of</text><text start="2599.14" dur="4.199">exposing those similarities or reasoning</text><text start="2601.54" dur="4.559">about what information lives in the</text><text start="2603.339" dur="7.041">edges when something that was otherwise</text><text start="2606.099" dur="8.041">you know uncoupled turns out to be</text><text start="2610.38" dur="5.739">aligned correlated or otherwise same</text><text start="2614.14" dur="4.14">that might change that might actually</text><text start="2616.119" dur="5.101">lead to a restructuring in the future it</text><text start="2618.28" dur="5.28">might creation of a new unit at at some</text><text start="2621.22" dur="5.04">mid scale that allows us to leverage</text><text start="2623.56" dur="5.34">that alignment</text><text start="2626.26" dur="5.16">I I think I keep looking to</text><text start="2628.9" dur="3.9">um biomimetic processes when it when it</text><text start="2631.42" dur="4.08">comes to a lot of these things and</text><text start="2632.8" dur="4.26">particularly like mycelial networks I</text><text start="2635.5" dur="3.42">think are a really great example one of</text><text start="2637.06" dur="4.259">the most you know sustainable Network</text><text start="2638.92" dur="4.14">economies in nature if you haven&apos;t seen</text><text start="2641.319" dur="4.321">the film fantastic fungi I definitely</text><text start="2643.06" dur="4.32">recommend checking it out but basically</text><text start="2645.64" dur="3.6">they&apos;re a distributed Network that</text><text start="2647.38" dur="3.78">problem solves at the edges they&apos;re</text><text start="2649.24" dur="3.54">incredible resource allocators they move</text><text start="2651.16" dur="3.72">things from one part of the network to</text><text start="2652.78" dur="5.4">another they interact with various</text><text start="2654.88" dur="5.64">organisms like trees like all anything</text><text start="2658.18" dur="3.659">underground is connected via mycelial</text><text start="2660.52" dur="3.78">networks which is transmitting</text><text start="2661.839" dur="5.101">information from parent trees to child</text><text start="2664.3" dur="5.64">trees or you know all over the the</text><text start="2666.94" dur="5.7">forest sort of thing so I think there&apos;s</text><text start="2669.94" dur="5.52">a lot that we can study and understand</text><text start="2672.64" dur="5.28">about the way that they sense make and</text><text start="2675.46" dur="4.44">you know they&apos;re also similar to neurons</text><text start="2677.92" dur="4.159">in the brain there are just all sorts of</text><text start="2679.9" dur="4.8">examples of these kinds of distributed</text><text start="2682.079" dur="6.04">decision-making networks in nature that</text><text start="2684.7" dur="5.28">I think we can learn from and find those</text><text start="2688.119" dur="4.621">principles of sustainability that we can</text><text start="2689.98" dur="5.04">bring into our human economic systems</text><text start="2692.74" dur="4.619">such that they can act more sustainably</text><text start="2695.02" dur="3.42">and in in alignment with their</text><text start="2697.359" dur="3.0">environment</text><text start="2698.44" dur="4.2">um like we see in nature</text><text start="2700.359" dur="4.681">so I I would like to add something that</text><text start="2702.64" dur="5.1">maybe is meta commentary I really really</text><text start="2705.04" dur="4.799">appreciate Jeff because I live in this</text><text start="2707.74" dur="4.079">world where like I&apos;m constantly trying</text><text start="2709.839" dur="4.441">to figure out all this really complex</text><text start="2711.819" dur="4.381">engineering and social system stuff with</text><text start="2714.28" dur="4.5">like legal Scholars and economic</text><text start="2716.2" dur="4.919">Scholars and Engineering Scholars and it</text><text start="2718.78" dur="4.559">can be really easy to get wrapped up in</text><text start="2721.119" dur="4.74">sort of big words and complex Concepts</text><text start="2723.339" dur="4.26">and then try to design things that</text><text start="2725.859" dur="4.081">benefit from that knowledge but at the</text><text start="2727.599" dur="4.621">end of the day it&apos;s not realistic to try</text><text start="2729.94" dur="4.98">to like sort of operate in that level of</text><text start="2732.22" dur="4.859">jargon all of the time and although I</text><text start="2734.92" dur="4.08">tend to live in that Universe I work</text><text start="2737.079" dur="5.04">pretty closely with Jeff and he does an</text><text start="2739.0" dur="5.76">amazing job making the the concepts that</text><text start="2742.119" dur="4.861">uh the block science team like either</text><text start="2744.76" dur="3.78">develops or learns about or collaborates</text><text start="2746.98" dur="3.54">with people on</text><text start="2748.54" dur="4.02">um widely accessible and I actually</text><text start="2750.52" dur="5.339">think that&apos;s also an important primitive</text><text start="2752.56" dur="6.84">of good governance is to have legibility</text><text start="2755.859" dur="5.521">and sort of public engagement even when</text><text start="2759.4" dur="4.8">some of the mechanisms are the design of</text><text start="2761.38" dur="4.62">those mechanisms requires like pretty</text><text start="2764.2" dur="4.56">intensive sort of research and design</text><text start="2766.0" dur="5.099">work to find the thing which will</text><text start="2768.76" dur="5.099">hopefully itself be simple even if it</text><text start="2771.099" dur="5.401">was a long path to get there so hard</text><text start="2773.859" dur="5.581">fought Simplicity as a goal and people</text><text start="2776.5" dur="5.16">in your team and who&apos;s who are really</text><text start="2779.44" dur="4.5">good at taking the complex and making it</text><text start="2781.66" dur="4.8">accessible is really really valuable so</text><text start="2783.94" dur="4.2">anyway huge props to Jeff so I&apos;ll stop</text><text start="2786.46" dur="3.24">talking now yeah well hopefully this</text><text start="2788.14" dur="4.08">episode will be more legible to the</text><text start="2789.7" dur="4.86">average listener uh because of you Jeff</text><text start="2792.22" dur="5.22">well I think that we&apos;ve spent about 43</text><text start="2794.56" dur="4.559">minutes diverging and now it is time to</text><text start="2797.44" dur="5.639">converge as we only have five minutes</text><text start="2799.119" dur="5.521">left so I&apos;ll ask you uh one broad uh</text><text start="2803.079" dur="3.721">closing question and the one very</text><text start="2804.64" dur="3.66">constrained closing question uh let&apos;s</text><text start="2806.8" dur="3.059">start with is there anything that I</text><text start="2808.3" dur="4.26">didn&apos;t ask that you wanna that you wanna</text><text start="2809.859" dur="4.921">talk about before we wrap</text><text start="2812.56" dur="4.259">I think the one of the most interesting</text><text start="2814.78" dur="3.059">things for me and web3 gets a lot of</text><text start="2816.819" dur="2.221">flack</text><text start="2817.839" dur="4.74">um you know there&apos;s there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="2819.04" dur="6.36">people thinking that web3 is here to</text><text start="2822.579" dur="5.101">um economize democracy but I think</text><text start="2825.4" dur="3.84">actually web3 is here to democratize</text><text start="2827.68" dur="2.76">economy</text><text start="2829.24" dur="3.119">um and I think there&apos;s you know there</text><text start="2830.44" dur="5.159">are only a few sort of large</text><text start="2832.359" dur="5.341">institutions capable of like</text><text start="2835.599" dur="3.72">enforcing like real change on this</text><text start="2837.7" dur="4.08">planet and it&apos;s you know governments</text><text start="2839.319" dur="3.841">corporations large-scale institutions</text><text start="2841.78" dur="3.6">um but most of those are actually not</text><text start="2843.16" dur="4.32">Democratic at all um in terms of</text><text start="2845.38" dur="4.38">realistically taking inputs from</text><text start="2847.48" dur="4.08">citizens or stakeholders especially</text><text start="2849.76" dur="3.059">those who are impacted</text><text start="2851.56" dur="2.94">um you know more so those who are</text><text start="2852.819" dur="2.581">impacted than those who are not I would</text><text start="2854.5" dur="2.94">say</text><text start="2855.4" dur="3.78">um so to the critics of web 3 out there</text><text start="2857.44" dur="3.54">saying hey you&apos;re just trying to make</text><text start="2859.18" dur="3.3">governance for sale</text><text start="2860.98" dur="3.78">um I would say actually I think we&apos;re</text><text start="2862.48" dur="4.2">just trying to make economies which are</text><text start="2864.76" dur="4.859">probably the most fundamental</text><text start="2866.68" dur="6.36">coordination mechanism of Humanity on a</text><text start="2869.619"

the</text><text start="2877.599" dur="4.74">planet ecologies</text><text start="2880.0" dur="4.74">um societies and so on</text><text start="2882.339" dur="5.041">exactly if you&apos;re up can you top that I</text><text start="2884.74" dur="5.22">no I definitely can&apos;t top this I I will</text><text start="2887.38" dur="4.26">say that relatedly</text><text start="2889.96" dur="4.56">um for me this is very much about</text><text start="2891.64" dur="4.86">understanding algorithms as policies and</text><text start="2894.52" dur="2.94">it does tie into what Jeff&apos;s saying in</text><text start="2896.5" dur="2.819">that</text><text start="2897.46" dur="4.26">um if we want to actually govern</text><text start="2899.319" dur="5.04">economies that we need to recognize that</text><text start="2901.72" dur="5.94">things like monetary policies and or</text><text start="2904.359" dur="4.801">measurements of contributions or Rewards</text><text start="2907.66" dur="4.08">or penalties</text><text start="2909.16" dur="5.88">Etc are all algorithms that get</text><text start="2911.74" dur="5.64">developed by communities for the goals</text><text start="2915.04" dur="5.16">of those communities and that respecting</text><text start="2917.38" dur="5.459">that those things are policy making acts</text><text start="2920.2" dur="5.28">and enfranchising people in that policy</text><text start="2922.839" dur="4.801">making is a big part of how we could</text><text start="2925.48" dur="4.619">actually produce this institutional</text><text start="2927.64" dur="4.199">biodiversity this pluralism of this</text><text start="2930.099" dur="3.901">effective pluralism</text><text start="2931.839" dur="5.28">um and obviously to Jeff&apos;s point the the</text><text start="2934.0" dur="5.579">big win then is if we can successfully</text><text start="2937.119" dur="4.801">democratize our economies</text><text start="2939.579" dur="4.74">that&apos;s a great place to end it where can</text><text start="2941.92" dur="4.58">people find block science and you both</text><text start="2944.319" dur="2.181">online</text><text start="2947.26"

you nailed</text><text start="2972.94" dur="6.72">it with that last one yeah third Moment</text><text start="2976.3" dur="4.92">of Zen uh which I I took a note here a</text><text start="2979.66" dur="3.36">lot of people think that web3 is here to</text><text start="2981.22" dur="3.66">economize democracy what they don&apos;t see</text><text start="2983.02" dur="4.02">is web 3 is here to
