dur="6.56">um how did i get into crypto well</text><text start="360.72" dur="5.28">at the time i was working in a very web</text><text start="364.24" dur="3.679">2 company</text><text start="366.0" dur="4.4">i was working for a venture</text><text start="367.919" dur="4.641">funded by microsoft and axa the</text><text start="370.4" dur="4.639">insurance company i was</text><text start="372.56" dur="4.479">leading the the marketing team as a cmo</text><text start="375.039" dur="5.841">and also the product team there</text><text start="377.039" dur="6.16">focused on the growth of the product and</text><text start="380.88" dur="4.56">yeah basically during that time i had a</text><text start="383.199" dur="5.12">friend that was talking to me about</text><text start="385.44" dur="4.72">color coins over and over and over and</text><text start="388.319" dur="3.281">telling me that everything was going to</text><text start="390.16" dur="2.319">be tokenized</text><text start="391.6" dur="3.28">uh</text><text start="392.479" dur="4.881">to me i didn&apos;t understand any any of</text><text start="394.88" dur="3.599">that like it was like game currency in</text><text start="397.36" dur="3.6">my mind</text><text start="398.479" dur="5.201">until he until actually ethereum came</text><text start="400.96" dur="4.959">out and he showed me a smart contract uh</text><text start="403.68" dur="4.959">that enabled you to swap assets without</text><text start="405.919" dur="5.201">having a middleman and when he explained</text><text start="408.639" dur="4.161">uh the consensus algorithms and</text><text start="411.12" dur="4.079">basically how it worked</text><text start="412.8" dur="4.48">it all clicked and i was like</text><text start="415.199" dur="5.28">wow this is giving</text><text start="417.28" dur="6.72">freedom to humanity in a way and i want</text><text start="420.479" dur="5.28">to be part of this um my story my let&apos;s</text><text start="424.0" dur="4.08">say my life story</text><text start="425.759" dur="4.801">got me into that pretty much because</text><text start="428.08" dur="4.959">i&apos;ve been an activist um i&apos;m a</text><text start="430.56" dur="3.28">venezuelan i was born in venezuela and i</text><text start="433.039" dur="2.481">was</text><text start="433.84" dur="4.639">basically fighting</text><text start="435.52" dur="5.6">for um freedom of speech and for</text><text start="438.479" dur="4.321">property rights back at home as the</text><text start="441.12" dur="5.84">government took everything away from my</text><text start="442.8" dur="7.44">family and and and yeah basically uh to</text><text start="446.96" dur="5.12">me like this was a way of giving power</text><text start="450.24" dur="5.28">back to humanity</text><text start="452.08" dur="5.04">and unless to nation states</text><text start="455.52" dur="3.2">totally and so you know when you got</text><text start="457.12" dur="3.28">into crypto i guess i&apos;m wondering the</text><text start="458.72" dur="2.56">connection between</text><text start="460.4" dur="2.56">uh</text><text start="461.28" dur="3.52">property rights as you saw the</text><text start="462.96" dur="4.0">government taking away property from</text><text start="464.8" dur="3.519">people and um you know how we kind of</text><text start="466.96" dur="4.239">have things in web 2 where we&apos;re all</text><text start="468.319" dur="4.241">serfs on zuckerberg&apos;s kingdom or</text><text start="471.199" dur="3.201">land or whatever like blockchains</text><text start="472.56" dur="3.759">actually give us digital property rights</text><text start="474.4" dur="4.56">was that a connection for for you</text><text start="476.319" dur="5.6">throughout the journey yeah definitely</text><text start="478.96" dur="5.6">so um actually the first thing that i</text><text start="481.919" dur="3.761">was doing uh in the space was tokenizing</text><text start="484.56" dur="2.88">real estate</text><text start="485.68" dur="4.16">tokenizing venture funds and venture</text><text start="487.44" dur="4.64">capital with a european legal framework</text><text start="489.84" dur="5.12">so the idea the idea that i had was to</text><text start="492.08" dur="6.32">enable anyone around the world to invest</text><text start="494.96" dur="6.16">in any type of physical asset uh using</text><text start="498.4" dur="5.28">this ledger technology and i work on</text><text start="501.12" dur="4.32">that for over two years and a half</text><text start="503.68" dur="3.519">let&apos;s say like uh trying like to</text><text start="505.44" dur="4.0">understand what was going on what&apos;s</text><text start="507.199" dur="5.041">happening but i realized</text><text start="509.44" dur="5.68">that you know there&apos;s there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="512.24" dur="5.84">laws that don&apos;t enable this to to be a</text><text start="515.12" dur="6.479">reality uh and all of these imaginary</text><text start="518.08" dur="7.199">lines that we call states or nations uh</text><text start="521.599" dur="6.24">basically that are not uh aligned and</text><text start="525.279" dur="6.321">and don&apos;t enable us to transact these</text><text start="527.839" dur="5.68">type of assets in a in a global way um</text><text start="531.6" dur="3.84">and i thought that i was probably i</text><text start="533.519" dur="5.681">don&apos;t know maybe 10 years 20 years too</text><text start="535.44" dur="6.48">early so i actually after that i decided</text><text start="539.2" dur="5.04">to focus on something that i thought was</text><text start="541.92" dur="4.16">going to make a bigger impact</text><text start="544.24" dur="4.08">and that&apos;s when i really got into the</text><text start="546.08" dur="4.0">house uh probably like three years three</text><text start="548.32" dur="3.92">years and a half ago</text><text start="550.08" dur="3.68">right it&apos;s crazy how fast things have</text><text start="552.24" dur="2.88">accelerated with dallas where they were</text><text start="553.76" dur="3.12">just this theory</text><text start="555.12" dur="4.56">three or five years ago and then we had</text><text start="556.88" dur="4.48">the dao which collapsed and ever since</text><text start="559.68" dur="5.12">molok dao it&apos;s feel like we&apos;ve had this</text><text start="561.36" dur="6.0">like exponentially accelerating</text><text start="564.8" dur="3.599">uh trend of of dallas forming and</text><text start="567.36" dur="3.919">collapsing and it&apos;s kind of this</text><text start="568.399" dur="4.721">cambrian explosion of of uh</text><text start="571.279" dur="3.761">of innovation and so i&apos;m wondering you</text><text start="573.12" dur="3.92">know like against that background what</text><text start="575.04" dur="3.84">were the insights and like the perfect</text><text start="577.04" dur="2.88">storm that caused you to found doing</text><text start="578.88" dur="2.72">good and</text><text start="579.92" dur="3.68">um you know i&apos;m curious like what how</text><text start="581.6" dur="4.08">you went from crypto and activism to</text><text start="583.6" dur="4.08">doing good as as the tip of the sphere</text><text start="585.68" dur="3.68">for the work you&apos;re doing</text><text start="587.68" dur="4.56">yeah okay that&apos;s a really good question</text><text start="589.36" dur="4.24">so

start="660.48" dur="5.599">basically to create conflict</text><text start="663.04" dur="4.56">um and basically extract as much as they</text><text start="666.079" dur="4.241">can from that</text><text start="667.6" dur="4.08">from that you know and kind of like have</text><text start="670.32" dur="3.28">everyone</text><text start="671.68" dur="4.64">hypnotized and not really realizing</text><text start="673.6" dur="5.52">what&apos;s what&apos;s happening so for example</text><text start="676.32" dur="5.84">uh in venezuela like at that time we</text><text start="679.12" dur="6.8">said that we hated uh the us and that we</text><text start="682.16" dur="5.2">hated europe uh but at the same time we</text><text start="685.92" dur="5.919">said that we love</text><text start="687.36"

throw</text><text start="697.04" dur="5.68">bombs back to our friends</text><text start="700.32" dur="3.28">so when i realized that i was part of</text><text start="702.72" dur="3.359">that</text><text start="703.6" dur="4.72">you know right i was like wow i don&apos;t</text><text start="706.079" dur="5.76">want to be part of this this is</text><text start="708.32" dur="4.319">this is so bad and that&apos;s when i left</text><text start="711.839" dur="2.961">so</text><text start="712.639" dur="4.561">and after that when i left</text><text start="714.8" dur="4.56">chavez died and when chavez died there</text><text start="717.2" dur="4.72">was like a lot of a lot of</text><text start="719.36" dur="5.599">things happening in venezuela</text><text start="721.92" dur="5.28">my friends were protesting and during my</text><text start="724.959" dur="4.641">university years i was actually like</text><text start="727.2" dur="3.92">very very active</text><text start="729.6" dur="4.16">organizing</text><text start="731.12" dur="4.64">events for people that for people to</text><text start="733.76" dur="4.319">express themselves and stuff</text><text start="735.76" dur="4.24">um so when i saw my friends going out to</text><text start="738.079" dur="4.401">the streets and so on i</text><text start="740.0" dur="6.0">i went with them and i started to</text><text start="742.48" dur="6.32">organize stuff until my life got in in</text><text start="746.0" dur="5.6">danger uh multiple times</text><text start="748.8" dur="4.719">uh to a point that you know like one of</text><text start="751.6" dur="2.96">my best friends got killed</text><text start="753.519" dur="4.081">um</text><text start="754.56" dur="4.959">oh wow yeah a couple of friends were</text><text start="757.6" dur="4.799">kidnapped uh</text><text start="759.519" dur="5.361">put in jail like my cousin got kidnapped</text><text start="762.399" dur="3.281">and like my life was</text><text start="764.88" dur="3.519">was</text><text start="765.68" dur="4.56">was uh in a point that you know i was</text><text start="768.399" dur="3.761">actually creating a lot of stress for my</text><text start="770.24" dur="3.2">parents</text><text start="772.16" dur="2.799">like they were</text><text start="773.44" dur="2.959">being called all the time telling them</text><text start="774.959" dur="3.841">that they were going to keep not me or</text><text start="776.399" dur="5.44">killed me for basically organizing</text><text start="778.8" dur="5.599">protests against the government</text><text start="781.839" dur="5.281">so yeah my parents decided to send me</text><text start="784.399" dur="6.24">out of the country so i came to europe</text><text start="787.12" dur="4.399">and when i came to europe um my first</text><text start="790.639" dur="3.521">job</text><text start="791.519" dur="4.721">was again building websites like telling</text><text start="794.16" dur="4.4">people that i knew how to build websites</text><text start="796.24" dur="4.96">and then after that i got hired by</text><text start="798.56" dur="5.6">rocket internet which is one of the</text><text start="801.2" dur="4.96">largest uh let&apos;s say venture builders in</text><text start="804.16" dur="4.56">the world and what they were doing they</text><text start="806.16" dur="4.32">were basically uh copying business</text><text start="808.72" dur="4.16">models from</text><text start="810.48" dur="5.12">uh let&apos;s say from successful areas and</text><text start="812.88" dur="3.759">bringing them to new areas</text><text start="815.6" dur="3.039">and</text><text start="816.639" dur="4.241">sounds like arbitrage again</text><text start="818.639" dur="4.56">again it was arbitrage it was exactly</text><text start="820.88" dur="4.079">arbitrage so</text><text start="823.199" dur="4.32">initially i was a</text><text start="824.959" dur="5.761">marketing manager and then a few few</text><text start="827.519" dur="4.241">months later uh i was leading the mobile</text><text start="830.72" dur="3.119">for</text><text start="831.76" dur="5.439">basically kind of like a company that is</text><text start="833.839" dur="5.761">called jumia and jumia is a</text><text start="837.199" dur="6.32">it&apos;s a marketplace of marketplaces so</text><text start="839.6" dur="4.88">you have amazon like ebay like uber</text><text start="843.519" dur="3.521">um</text><text start="844.48" dur="6.159">booking.com and initially it was focused</text><text start="847.04" dur="5.919">on the on the travel side and yeah i</text><text start="850.639" dur="3.841">thought that we were you know creating a</text><text start="852.959" dur="3.601">lot of value for</text><text start="854.48" dur="3.84">africans at the very beginning but then</text><text start="856.56" dur="3.36">i really understood</text><text start="858.32" dur="4.079">after you know being</text><text start="859.92" dur="5.2">trained and going and learning about</text><text start="862.399" dur="4.161">facebook tools and google tools i</text><text start="865.12" dur="3.839">learned that basically we were</text><text start="866.56" dur="7.92">colonizing africa with cash</text><text start="868.959" dur="8.32">um and i felt really really bad about it</text><text start="874.48" dur="4.4">and that&apos;s when i decided to</text><text start="877.279" dur="4.481">leave</text><text start="878.88" dur="4.72">and i joined this venture from</text><text start="881.76" dur="3.6">microsoft and axa that was basically</text><text start="883.6" dur="4.799">connecting patients and doctors using</text><text start="885.36" dur="4.479">machine learning and chatbots um</text><text start="888.399" dur="3.44">and there i thought i was doing</text><text start="889.839" dur="2.881">something more humane</text><text start="891.839" dur="3.68">but</text><text start="892.72" dur="3.84">again with two problems</text><text start="895.519" dur="3.68">um</text><text start="896.56" dur="6.16">you know kind of like</text><text start="899.199" dur="5.121">let me to leave that um right and yeah</text><text start="902.72" dur="4.32">that&apos;s basically how</text><text start="904.32" dur="4.4">my whole life has led me to</text><text start="907.04" dur="4.56">always trying to find</text><text start="908.72" dur="4.559">something that is giving more and more</text><text start="911.6" dur="4.32">freedom to humans</text><text start="913.279" dur="4.721">um so for me uh</text><text start="915.92" dur="5.52">that was that was doused like the</text><text start="918.0" dur="5.839">initial thing that i said wow this is</text><text start="921.44" dur="4.8">this is giving some sort of freedom up</text><text start="923.839" dur="4.881">um after you know after understanding a</text><text start="926.24" dur="4.159">little bit about cryptocurrencies uh and</text><text start="928.72" dur="4.08">the freedom is that you could</text><text start="930.399" dur="4.641">essentially decide what you want to work</text><text start="932.8" dur="5.36">on and when you want to work on and</text><text start="935.04" dur="6.4">basically hopefully the community will</text><text start="938.16" dur="4.88">will notice your contribution and and</text><text start="941.44" dur="4.24">give you back</text><text start="943.04" dur="5.359">so to me that was kind of like some sort</text><text start="945.68" dur="6.64">of freedom uh but</text><text start="948.399" dur="5.281">um then i when i found any of these uh i</text><text start="952.32" dur="4.639">realized that there was another</text><text start="953.68" dur="5.68">abstraction of value that was</text><text start="956.959" dur="5.361">deeper or like it was giving more power</text><text start="959.36" dur="5.279">to the individual because before with</text><text start="962.32" dur="5.12">cryptocurrencies in general like with</text><text start="964.639" dur="4.801">ethereum and so on like group of group</text><text start="967.44" dur="5.28">of people could come in and you know</text><text start="969.44" dur="4.8">write a white paper and basically launch</text><text start="972.72" dur="3.2">launch something that someone else could</text><text start="974.24" dur="3.519">support them from the other side of the</text><text start="975.92" dur="6.719">world um</text><text start="977.759" dur="7.361">and and then we pass from that to now</text><text start="982.639" dur="5.281">individuals anywhere in the world can</text><text start="985.12" dur="5.279">create whatever sort of value tokenizer</text><text start="987.92" dur="4.88">out there and you don&apos;t need to have</text><text start="990.399" dur="4.401">everyone uh you don&apos;t need to uh you</text><text start="992.8" dur="5.44">don&apos;t need that everyone agrees on that</text><text start="994.8" dur="5.76">specific value you just need one person</text><text start="998.24" dur="3.92">that that is basically willing to</text><text start="1000.56" dur="2.48">support that value</text><text start="1002.16" dur="3.679">um</text><text start="1003.04" dur="5.039">and to me that was like wow that means</text><text start="1005.839" dur="4.0">that essentially if i value something</text><text start="1008.079" dur="4.481">and someone else around the other world</text><text start="1009.839" dur="5.68">values that same something then it does</text><text start="1012.56" dur="4.959">have value uh and it was mind-blowing</text><text start="1015.519" dur="4.24">for me was like wow this is giving</text><text start="1017.519" dur="5.201">freedom for people to actually create</text><text start="1019.759" dur="6.241">value it&apos;s not any more nation-states</text><text start="1022.72" dur="6.56">but anyone can create value uh</text><text start="1026.0" dur="5.6">um and basically represent represented</text><text start="1029.28" dur="4.24">in a digital way so you&apos;ve got some</text><text start="1031.6" dur="3.599">money but how are you going to use it</text><text start="1033.52" dur="4.64">you want to spend</text><text start="1035.199" dur="4.801">me shopping now bro

and</text><text start="1209.12" dur="6.24">and yeah also like the market went down</text><text start="1212.88" dur="4.159">a lot and and the idea was to create</text><text start="1215.36" dur="3.52">this marketing dow for the whole</text><text start="1217.039" dur="4.481">ethereum community but it was depending</text><text start="1218.88" dur="5.279">on donations so</text><text

start="1229.52" dur="6.399">what happened was that um yeah everyone</text><text start="1232.24" dur="6.16">went to build their own stuff and myself</text><text start="1235.919" dur="5.601">i started to build a platform called</text><text start="1238.4" dur="4.96">five pandemics and fight pandemics was</text><text start="1241.52" dur="3.44">essentially a place to connect those in</text><text

start="1301.679" dur="5.841">because maybe there was no enough</text><text start="1303.76" dur="6.399">education uh from my side or maybe i</text><text start="1307.52" dur="5.76">wasn&apos;t able to explain explain myself</text><text start="1310.159" dur="5.52">enough like how how we could potentially</text><text start="1313.28" dur="4.16">coordinate this this</text><text start="1315.679" dur="4.0">this mutual aid</text><text start="1317.44" dur="5.359">platform</text><text start="1319.679" dur="4.961">so yeah uh what i saw at that time what</text><text start="1322.799" dur="4.481">was happening with nft is how people</text><text start="1324.64" dur="5.039">were using nfts and i thought okay we</text><text start="1327.28" dur="4.96">can create kind of like a game where</text><text start="1329.679" dur="4.48">people contribute and they receive nfts</text><text start="1332.24" dur="4.559">as a proof of</text><text start="1334.159" dur="4.4">contribution proof of doing something</text><text start="1336.799" dur="4.0">so</text><text start="1338.559" dur="3.201">that&apos;s when the idea really clicked</text><text start="1340.799" dur="3.281">because</text><text start="1341.76" dur="4.96">uh what i was while i was building uh</text><text start="1344.08" dur="3.92">five pandemics um i was interviewing a</text><text start="1346.72" dur="5.199">lot of people that were behind</text><text start="1348.0" dur="5.6">non-profits ngos and i realized that</text><text start="1351.919" dur="4.24">most of the people that are behind these</text><text start="1353.6" dur="5.36">organizations are actually artists and</text><text start="1356.159" dur="5.281">actually creators so to me it was kind</text><text start="1358.96" dur="3.44">of weird that it did that it didn&apos;t</text><text start="1361.44" dur="3.84">exist</text><text start="1362.4" dur="5.279">uh a bridge between the creator economy</text><text start="1365.28" dur="5.12">and the giving economy or the altruistic</text><text start="1367.679" dur="6.0">economy so that was that was the moment</text><text start="1370.4" dur="7.84">that i that that basically led to the</text><text start="1373.679" dur="8.401">the ideas of doing good and obviously uh</text><text start="1378.24" dur="5.76">this idea uh these ideas of doing good</text><text start="1382.08" dur="4.719">have been you know um</text><text start="1384.0" dur="5.84">fueled by by many different many</text><text start="1386.799" dur="6.24">different ideas uh starting with git</text><text start="1389.84" dur="6.079">coin as well and and with uh common</text><text start="1393.039" dur="5.76">stack and with other let&apos;s say other</text><text start="1395.919" dur="5.841">projects that are you know uh that are</text><text start="1398.799" dur="6.081">trying to do good for humanity uh right</text><text start="1401.76" dur="5.279">and also like i i was like</text><text start="1404.88" dur="3.84">meeting more and more people and</text><text start="1407.039" dur="4.64">realizing that</text><text start="1408.72" dur="5.12">that the tribe was there you know that</text><text start="1411.679" dur="4.641">people want to do good</text><text start="1413.84" dur="4.4">and they have really good intentions and</text><text start="1416.32" dur="3.92">and yeah that&apos;s what motivated me to to</text><text start="1418.24" dur="3.28">get this this going</text><text start="1420.24" dur="4.08">yeah yeah i mean do you think there&apos;s</text><text start="1421.52" dur="4.24">such an amazing uh nascent</text><text start="1424.32" dur="3.28">community of people who are working on</text><text start="1425.76" dur="3.84">regenerative crypto economics public</text><text start="1427.6" dur="4.72">goods doing good</text><text start="1429.6" dur="4.24">and more solar pump type stuff and i</text><text start="1432.32" dur="2.719">think that it&apos;s really a growing niche</text><text start="1433.84" dur="2.88">in the community and you know that&apos;s</text><text start="1435.039" dur="3.921">part of we wanted to highlight some of</text><text start="1436.72" dur="4.24">these stories on this podcast i guess</text><text start="1438.96" dur="2.88">i&apos;m wondering like what is a world where</text><text start="1440.96" dur="2.8">you</text><text start="1441.84" dur="3.68">were doing good as maximally successful</text><text start="1443.76" dur="4.159">look like like what&apos;s different in that</text><text start="1445.52" dur="4.96">type of world versus uh if doing good</text><text start="1447.919" dur="4.481">wasn&apos;t there</text><text start="1450.48" dur="4.16">i would say</text><text start="1452.4" dur="5.519">a world without</text><text start="1454.64" dur="6.08">needing to funding social causes because</text><text start="1457.919" dur="3.841">it&apos;s already inherited in</text><text start="1460.72" dur="3.92">in the</text><text start="1461.76" dur="4.72">in our system</text><text start="1464.64" dur="3.12">so it&apos;s baked in at the base layer of</text><text start="1466.48" dur="2.559">the system</text><text start="1467.76" dur="2.56">correct</text><text start="1469.039" dur="2.321">okay</text><text start="1470.32" dur="3.12">got it</text><text start="1471.36" dur="4.0">um do you think that uh doing good will</text><text start="1473.44" dur="3.76">expand into other mechanisms or is it</text><text start="1475.36" dur="3.04">going to be nfts the whole the whole way</text><text start="1477.2" dur="3.599">down</text><text start="1478.4" dur="5.36">um we&apos;re starting with nfts</text><text start="1480.799" dur="4.321">just because as i said i believe that</text><text start="1483.76" dur="3.519">there&apos;s uh</text><text start="1485.12" dur="4.64">there&apos;s there&apos;s this bridge missing</text><text start="1487.279" dur="5.041">between the creators and the social</text><text start="1489.76" dur="4.56">causes which are usually managed by</text><text start="1492.32" dur="3.52">creators</text><text start="1494.32" dur="5.12">but then</text><text start="1495.84" dur="5.839">i believe that we should also uh create</text><text start="1499.44" dur="5.68">tools for managing</text><text start="1501.679" dur="5.201">these social causes like enabling them</text><text start="1505.12" dur="3.919">to govern</text><text start="1506.88" dur="4.799">in a more transparent way and to</text><text start="1509.039" dur="4.961">basically spread that knowledge across</text><text start="1511.679" dur="3.761">other social courses as well so</text><text start="1514.0" dur="2.4">basically</text><text start="1515.44" dur="1.92">opening</text><text start="1516.4" dur="3.6">up</text><text start="1517.36" dur="4.64">uh or making open source</text><text start="1520.0" dur="4.159">doing good or social</text><text start="1522.0" dur="4.4">social endeavors and social</text><text start="1524.159" dur="4.561">organizations</text><text start="1526.4" dur="3.36">right yeah sort of envision a world in</text><text start="1528.72" dur="4.4">which</text><text start="1529.76" dur="5.12">there&apos;s multiple social causes um</text><text start="1533.12" dur="3.2">and then there&apos;s multiple mechanisms</text><text start="1534.88" dur="2.56">through which you can support them and</text><text start="1536.32" dur="3.839">they&apos;re all like we&apos;re building this</text><text start="1537.44" dur="4.479">pluralistic civilizational scale</text><text start="1540.159" dur="4.561">uh infrastructure for funding public</text><text start="1541.919" dur="4.961">goods and social causes um and the</text><text start="1544.72" dur="4.88">pluralism there i think is the key that</text><text start="1546.88" dur="5.76">i&apos;m really starting to discover uh</text><text start="1549.6" dur="6.0">is that um giveth and get coin and doing</text><text start="1552.64" dur="4.399">good and radical and common stack and</text><text start="1555.6" dur="2.88">all these other projects like the</text><text start="1557.039" dur="4.24">pluralism and the diversity of</text><text start="1558.48" dur="4.88">mechanisms that support those causes is</text><text start="1561.279" dur="4.801">really important to me so</text><text start="1563.36" dur="3.919">um hopefully we&apos;re listening to this in</text><text start="1566.08" dur="2.64">a year or two we&apos;ve built</text><text start="1567.279" dur="5.601">interoperability between all these</text><text start="1568.72" dur="5.839">platforms 100 i i also believe that you</text><text start="1572.88" dur="4.08">know like we are all supporting each</text><text start="1574.559" dur="5.521">other at the end of the day uh like for</text><text start="1576.96" dur="5.76">example uh five pandemics you know was</text><text start="1580.08" dur="5.199">supported by the community on git coin</text><text start="1582.72" dur="4.0">and we were able to pay we were able to</text><text start="1585.279" dur="4.4">pay for</text><text start="1586.72" dur="5.199">uh the servers using those using those</text><text start="1589.679" dur="4.561">contributions on git coin for example</text><text start="1591.919" dur="3.201">and that helped</text><text start="1594.24" dur="5.039">kick</text><text start="1595.12" dur="5.919">kickstart our our endeavor and from that</text><text start="1599.279" dur="4.321">you know we got the first community</text><text start="1601.039" dur="3.76">members for doing good and so on so we</text><text start="1603.6" dur="3.76">are all</text><text start="1604.799" dur="4.561">you know interconnected in one way or in</text><text start="1607.36" dur="4.4">another for sure and</text><text start="1609.36" dur="6.16">making sure that we can create you know</text><text start="1611.76" dur="5.519">interoperable uh mechanisms between all</text><text start="1615.52" dur="3.12">of these ecosystems i think it will be</text><text start="1617.279" dur="3.601">amazing</text><text start="1618.64" dur="4.08">yeah totally all right well be careful i</text><text start="1620.88" dur="2.72">might make you into a testimonial if</text><text start="1622.72" dur="4.439">you&apos;re not</text><text start="1623.6" dur="3.559">if you&apos;re not careful</text><text start="1628.0" dur="4.72">i guess i i guess i&apos;m wondering you know</text><text start="1630.4" dur="4.08">how do you keep that optimism alive like</text><text start="1632.72" dur="4.64">when you&apos;re grinding on doing good and</text><text start="1634.48" dur="4.24">working on the next release and</text><text start="1637.36" dur="2.559">you know you read the news and something</text><text start="1638.72" dur="2.559">bad has happened how do you keep that</text><text start="1639.919" dur="4.48">optimism alive</text><text start="1641.279" dur="5.441">look i already lost everything</text><text start="1644.399" dur="5.041">you know i already lost everything</text><text start="1646.72" dur="7.199">uh financially speaking when i was</text><text start="1649.44" dur="6.56">living in venezuela i lost also my house</text><text start="1653.919" dur="3.681">my place where i was</text><text start="1656.0" dur="4.64">raised i lost</text><text start="1657.6" dur="5.76">being able to be next to my family i</text><text start="1660.64" dur="6.399">lost the people that i loved the most i</text><text start="1663.36" dur="6.319">lost i lost them uh i lost being close</text><text start="1667.039" dur="3.441">to them at least yeah um</text><text start="1669.679" dur="4.0">so</text><text start="1670.48" dur="5.36">i don&apos;t have anything else to lose</text><text start="1673.679" dur="4.24">so i&apos;m just focused on the positive side</text><text start="1675.84" dur="4.319">of things rather than in the negative</text><text start="1677.919" dur="4.321">side of things</text><text start="1680.159" dur="3.041">because i think i believe in a world</text><text start="1682.24" dur="4.0">where</text><text start="1683.2" dur="3.839">where you know we can live without</text><text start="1686.24" dur="4.24">uh</text><text start="1687.039" dur="6.161">without violence and without coercive</text><text start="1690.48" dur="4.16">ways of enforcing things on humans</text><text start="1693.2" dur="3.839">and</text><text start="1694.64" dur="3.279">and yeah i believe in a world where we</text><text start="1697.039" dur="4.161">can</text><text start="1697.919" dur="6.401">live using the energy the the most</text><text start="1701.2" dur="4.32">precious energy to me which is love</text><text start="1704.32" dur="2.4">um</text><text start="1705.52" dur="2.48">and yeah</text><text start="1706.72" dur="4.319">that&apos;s why</text><text start="1708.0" dur="4.24">i&apos;m so positive and optimistic</text><text start="1711.039" dur="3.681">nice</text><text start="1712.24" dur="3.76">appreciate that perspective um</text><text start="1714.72" dur="2.48">i guess is there anything i didn&apos;t ask</text><text start="1716.0" dur="3.279">you that you want to say about the</text><text start="1717.2" dur="4.56">ecosystem about doing good</text><text start="1719.279" dur="4.241">about what&apos;s on the roadmap</text><text start="1721.76" dur="2.639">yeah one of the things that is in the</text><text start="1723.52" dur="1.92">roadmap</text><text start="1724.399" dur="4.241">is</text><text start="1725.44" dur="4.0">this multi-gallery ecosystem</text><text start="1728.64" dur="3.759">which</text><text start="1729.44" dur="4.719">will enable communities to come in</text><text start="1732.399" dur="3.201">and curate</text><text start="1734.159" dur="4.481">their own</text><text start="1735.6" dur="5.199">exhibitions or their own drops so for</text><text start="1738.64" dur="5.279">example we&apos;re going to have at 8th</text><text start="1740.799" dur="5.041">denver we&apos;re going to have um</text><text start="1743.919" dur="3.36">let&apos;s say a

dur="6.079">yeah so enabling that to the broader</text><text start="1752.08" dur="5.68">ecosystem uh is going to be</text><text start="1755.679" dur="3.921">to me is going to be it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="1757.76" dur="4.08">great because it&apos;s going to create more</text><text start="1759.6" dur="5.24">and more synergies between all of all of</text><text start="1761.84" dur="4.88">us all of the different project projects</text><text start="1764.84" dur="3.88">um so</text><text start="1766.72" dur="5.28">enabling let&apos;s say communities that</text><text start="1768.72" dur="6.24">already exist in web3 uh to basically</text><text start="1772.0" dur="6.0">use their tokens and curate uh within</text><text start="1774.96" dur="6.0">our within within our
