dur="4.92">episode really excited to talk about</text><text start="193.62" dur="4.92">circles ebi so let&apos;s get into it what is</text><text start="196.5" dur="5.34">circles Ubi</text><text start="198.54" dur="4.8">yeah Circle CBI is uh in a way two</text><text start="201.84" dur="4.44">things</text><text start="203.34" dur="6.42">um one kind of an identity system but</text><text start="206.28" dur="7.379">the primary primary thing is it tries to</text><text start="209.76" dur="6.72">bring Universal basic income uh into the</text><text start="213.659" dur="4.021">World by creating a new currency of</text><text start="216.48" dur="4.08">better form of money</text><text start="217.68" dur="5.4">got it so uh what what is that currency</text><text start="220.56" dur="5.16">and and how does it work</text><text start="223.08" dur="7.019">yeah so I mean essentially</text><text start="225.72" dur="6.54">I guess uh Bitcoin uh came along and uh</text><text start="230.099" dur="5.041">and um</text><text start="232.26" dur="3.479">opened up the question or made it</text><text start="235.14" dur="5.4">um</text><text start="235.739" dur="7.681">uh made us humans think about what money</text><text start="240.54" dur="5.4">is again and how</text><text start="243.42" dur="3.84">um money uh could be designed and</text><text start="245.94" dur="2.34">obviously kind of that it can be</text><text start="247.26" dur="4.32">designed</text><text start="248.28" dur="7.14">um uh yeah I guess outside of a state</text><text start="251.58" dur="4.52">and um yeah our second CBI</text><text start="255.42" dur="3.319">um</text><text start="256.1" dur="5.74">realizes this potential that we can</text><text start="258.739" dur="7.481">design money different</text><text start="261.84" dur="5.639">um and says okay what if we bake in the</text><text start="266.22" dur="3.56">idea</text><text start="267.479" dur="5.521">um of universal basic income</text><text start="269.78" dur="4.9">directly into the money system and kind</text><text start="273.0" dur="4.8">of there are two two arguments for that</text><text start="274.68" dur="8.16">one you might be convinced generally</text><text start="277.8" dur="7.86">that it&apos;s a good idea uh to um to want</text><text start="282.84" dur="7.26">the Ubi and then</text><text start="285.66" dur="6.36">you can either say we take an existing</text><text start="290.1" dur="3.84">um an existing money system and then</text><text start="292.02" dur="3.739">somehow have a redistribution mechanism</text><text start="293.94" dur="6.96">somehow collect money and then</text><text start="295.759" dur="9.341">distribute it or if you want that anyhow</text><text start="300.9" dur="6.5">um then you can also directly</text><text start="305.1" dur="5.64">um yeah kind of bake it into the money</text><text start="307.4" dur="7.12">itself and that&apos;s kind of 0.1 for</text><text start="310.74" dur="4.82">circuit CBI point two is</text><text start="314.52" dur="5.82">um</text><text start="315.56" dur="8.32">that uh yeah with every money system</text><text start="320.34" dur="7.079">um you might ask why uh why would people</text><text start="323.88" dur="7.56">want uh want to adopt it and it needs to</text><text start="327.419" dur="5.521">have a perception of of fairness and</text><text start="331.44" dur="3.42">obviously</text><text start="332.94" dur="4.02">um yeah kind of let&apos;s say it was Bitcoin</text><text start="334.86" dur="4.32">you have those early adopters and those</text><text start="336.96" dur="4.86">are really Keen uh that everyone will</text><text start="339.18" dur="6.78">adopt Bitcoin because essentially that</text><text start="341.82" dur="5.52">would mean a huge wealth transfer uh to</text><text start="345.96" dur="3.12">them</text><text start="347.34" dur="3.24">um so an alternative perspective is</text><text start="349.08" dur="5.22">simply saying okay we want something</text><text start="350.58" dur="7.08">similar as Bitcoin but we want uh to</text><text start="354.3" dur="5.459">have a fair a fair distribution</text><text start="357.66" dur="5.16">um of the money and yeah that&apos;s another</text><text start="359.759" dur="6.481">perspective of looking at circles</text><text start="362.82" dur="6.42">I&apos;d love to to uh</text><text start="366.24" dur="7.019">to to maybe ground the user in an</text><text start="369.24" dur="6.0">example of how circles Ubi works and uh</text><text start="373.259" dur="4.741">oh man I remember signing up for circles</text><text start="375.24" dur="4.92">Ubi about a year ago when it was really</text><text start="378.0" dur="3.479">going viral and so I&apos;m wondering if you</text><text start="380.16" dur="3.42">could if you could talk about that first</text><text start="381.479" dur="4.381">time user experience uh what do you have</text><text start="383.58" dur="5.179">to do in order to in order to get the</text><text start="385.86" dur="6.779">the circles Ubi tokens</text><text start="388.759" dur="5.141">right so yeah in circles</text><text start="392.639" dur="3.56">um</text><text start="393.9" dur="6.54">as soon as you sign up</text><text start="396.199" dur="7.961">you get one Circle an hour so kind of</text><text start="400.44" dur="5.94">one Circle represents uh in a way one</text><text start="404.16" dur="4.319">um one human hour</text><text start="406.38" dur="3.48">um but circles has this yeah kind of</text><text start="408.479" dur="2.22">specific</text><text start="409.86" dur="5.399">um</text><text start="410.699" dur="6.961">civil resistance uh mechanism and</text><text start="415.259" dur="6.541">um yeah and that&apos;s based on web of trust</text><text start="417.66" dur="7.92">so kind of the the standard way to uh</text><text start="421.8" dur="4.519">kind of to sign up for it is</text><text start="425.58" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="426.319" dur="6.581">to connect to other people</text><text start="429.6" dur="6.36">or concrete the interface is designed in</text><text start="432.9" dur="4.98">a way that you need to be trusted uh by</text><text start="435.96" dur="3.359">three people who have</text><text start="437.88" dur="4.5">um already</text><text start="439.319" dur="6.541">um joined the system and again that&apos;s uh</text><text start="442.38" dur="6.3">that is yeah that is are there two</text><text start="445.86" dur="5.0">reasons uh why it works that well that</text><text start="448.68" dur="5.16">way one is indeed a civil resistant</text><text start="450.86" dur="7.3">aspect but the other is is even more</text><text start="453.84" dur="6.72">important the other is that money is</text><text start="458.16" dur="5.72">always or money is essentially a social</text><text start="460.56" dur="6.78">uh construct if you are on an island</text><text start="463.88" dur="7.24">alone then money really doesn&apos;t matter</text><text start="467.34" dur="5.699">because money is always uh yeah kind of</text><text start="471.12" dur="4.68">tied to humans money is only only</text><text start="473.039" dur="5.16">relevant to humans so humans decide to</text><text start="475.8" dur="3.899">accept something</text><text start="478.199" dur="4.381">um as money</text><text start="479.699" dur="3.421">and that is essentially</text><text start="482.58" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="483.12" dur="6.18">what what what this trust connections uh</text><text start="486.72" dur="4.699">means so in circles</text><text start="489.3" dur="7.56">actually if you look under the hood</text><text start="491.419" dur="8.981">everyone individually issues their own</text><text start="496.86" dur="7.14">um yeah their own specific token so in</text><text start="500.4" dur="7.199">that sense their own kind of money</text><text start="504.0" dur="6.96">and trusting each other means</text><text start="507.599" dur="5.521">um if you would trust me then or if we</text><text start="510.96" dur="5.639">trust each other then essentially what</text><text start="513.12" dur="6.299">we are saying is I am accepting your</text><text start="516.599" dur="3.421">money your personal money and</text><text start="519.419" dur="3.661">um</text><text start="520.02" dur="6.12">and you are accepting uh my personal</text><text start="523.08" dur="3.9">money and to make things</text><text start="526.14" dur="4.16">um</text><text start="526.98" dur="7.38">to make things uh yeah kind of ideally</text><text start="530.3" dur="7.42">uh easy and ideally to be able to</text><text start="534.36" dur="6.12">abstract away from from the fact that in</text><text start="537.72" dur="4.7">circles you hold uh yeah kind of you</text><text start="540.48" dur="5.1">hold very different forms of money</text><text start="542.42" dur="5.32">distrusting each other means we are kind</text><text start="545.58" dur="5.4">of making our currencies with with each</text><text start="547.74" dur="5.7">other fungible by saying we can</text><text start="550.98" dur="4.919">um exchange them one to one</text><text start="553.44" dur="6.18">so if you&apos;re new to circles you issue</text><text start="555.899" dur="5.461">your own money kind of uh then then no</text><text start="559.62" dur="4.44">one no one would accept it but if you</text><text start="561.36" dur="5.58">are part of well of a circle of a web of</text><text start="564.06" dur="4.98">trust then within that Circle or within</text><text start="566.94" dur="4.86">those trust connections</text><text start="569.04" dur="5.22">um yeah your money or your circuits are</text><text start="571.8" dur="3.719">uh are fungible and can be can be</text><text start="574.26" dur="3.6">transferred</text><text start="575.519" dur="4.921">so we had a couple episodes ago we had</text><text start="577.86" dur="4.38">Brian Ford uh who is a professor that&apos;s</text><text start="580.44" dur="5.76">been studying civil resistance on the</text><text start="582.24" dur="5.64">podcast and he was saying that basically</text><text start="586.2" dur="5.1">in order to create civil resistance you</text><text start="587.88" dur="5.22">have four options you have uh in terms</text><text start="591.3" dur="3.9">of mechanisms to connect the system to</text><text start="593.1" dur="3.54">an actual user you can use Biometrics</text><text start="595.2" dur="3.72">you can use government identification</text><text start="596.64" dur="4.199">like kyc kind of stuff you can use</text><text start="598.92" dur="3.12">presence-based things which is like</text><text start="600.839" dur="2.821">you&apos;re in front of me so I know that</text><text start="602.04" dur="3.78">you&apos;re a human and then the last one is</text><text start="603.66" dur="4.619">web of trust where I trust you and you</text><text start="605.82" dur="5.22">trust uh Alice and Alice trust Bob and</text><text start="608.279" dur="4.74">so there&apos;s a flow of social trust and it</text><text start="611.04" dur="4.979">seems like from what you said that</text><text start="613.019" dur="4.861">circles Ubi is based on web of trust is</text><text start="616.019" dur="5.281">that a correct perception</text><text start="617.88" dur="6.12">oh absolutely so uh yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s in</text><text start="621.3" dur="6.24">its in its pure form uh it&apos;s completely</text><text start="624.0" dur="7.56">based uh on on web of trust it is</text><text start="627.54" dur="7.799">possible to add um to add other uh other</text><text start="631.56" dur="6.48">forms to it so uh that is yeah not or</text><text start="635.339" dur="5.041">kind of only experimentally live but we</text><text start="638.04" dur="4.68">we have uh fee or we have features</text><text start="640.38" dur="4.399">coming up that you can yeah kind of get</text><text start="642.72" dur="4.98">additional attestations or verifications</text><text start="644.779" dur="3.701">uh to your account and that could indeed</text><text start="647.7" dur="3.3">be</text><text start="648.48" dur="5.039">um well the other options you mentioned</text><text start="651.0" dur="5.22">um but at its core circuits is based on</text><text start="653.519" dur="5.521">this web of trust exactly</text><text start="656.22" dur="4.98">basically I sign up uh I have to get a</text><text start="659.04" dur="4.58">vouch of some sort from three people</text><text start="661.2" dur="6.24">that I know and then I can start getting</text><text start="663.62" dur="5.38">the token drip so it&apos;s basically a</text><text start="667.44" dur="4.86">mechanism through which the sign up flow</text><text start="669.0" dur="6.54">is baking in the creation of the web of</text><text start="672.3" dur="6.3">trust and then once I&apos;m in then we can</text><text start="675.54" dur="4.979">the system releases Ubi tokens to me is</text><text start="678.6" dur="3.6">that more or less accurate</text><text start="680.519" dur="2.88">correct correct</text><text start="682.2" dur="3.06">cool</text><text start="683.399" dur="2.401">um yeah so I mean I&apos;m curious</text><text start="685.26" dur="2.46">um</text><text start="685.8" dur="3.599">I really have a thesis about a lot of</text><text start="687.72" dur="3.84">these regen mechanics so okay so first</text><text start="689.399" dur="4.44">off going from one token one vote to one</text><text start="691.56" dur="3.66">human one vote I think is a really huge</text><text start="693.839" dur="3.06">step forward for the ecosystem because</text><text start="695.22" dur="3.299">it brings more democracy into how we</text><text start="696.899" dur="4.981">build these web3 mechanisms so I think</text><text start="698.519" dur="4.921">like that in its own is really novel I</text><text start="701.88" dur="3.48">found that for anyone to really take</text><text start="703.44" dur="3.3">seriously any of these civil resistance</text><text start="705.36" dur="3.84">mechanisms there has to be like an</text><text start="706.74" dur="3.9">economic mechanism that causes people to</text><text start="709.2" dur="3.12">care enough to sign up for the Civil</text><text start="710.64" dur="4.08">resistance like on bitcoin it&apos;s like you</text><text start="712.32" dur="3.54">do all the trust bonus stuff because you</text><text start="714.72" dur="4.559">want to participate in the grants</text><text start="715.86" dur="5.7">matching seems like on circles Ubi you</text><text start="719.279" dur="5.341">um you do the web of trusting because</text><text start="721.56" dur="4.56">you want to get the Ubi tokens and um</text><text start="724.62" dur="3.54">you know I think it&apos;s interesting to</text><text start="726.12" dur="3.659">know that there&apos;s like</text><text start="728.16" dur="2.88">um there&apos;s almost like two parts to the</text><text start="729.779" dur="3.06">system there&apos;s the Civil resistance</text><text start="731.04" dur="5.16">identity mechanism and then there&apos;s the</text><text start="732.839" dur="5.401">reward mechanism and you know</text><text start="736.2" dur="4.379">uh like Bitcoin uses quadratic funding</text><text start="738.24" dur="4.86">circles Ubi uses Ubi</text><text start="740.579" dur="4.081">um can you say more about the Ubi end of</text><text start="743.1" dur="4.02">the spectrum like why&apos;d you guys decide</text><text start="744.66" dur="5.16">to go with Ubi for this as opposed to</text><text start="747.12" dur="5.7">some other uh reward mechanism</text><text start="749.82" dur="6.06">yeah I I would uh go to this question</text><text start="752.82" dur="4.68">but before that I would also raise uh</text><text start="755.88" dur="4.56">yeah intention for another aspect of it</text><text start="757.5" dur="5.399">you mentioned there needs to be economic</text><text start="760.44" dur="3.72">incentives and yes there is an economic</text><text start="762.899" dur="3.841">incentive</text><text start="764.16" dur="4.44">um to kind of sign up to get the Ubi but</text><text start="766.74" dur="5.88">there&apos;s also a very interesting other</text><text start="768.6" dur="7.56">element of it which I think is missing</text><text start="772.62" dur="6.06">in many other web of Trust Systems and</text><text start="776.16" dur="4.859">that is yeah the opposite of a of a</text><text start="778.68" dur="5.159">reward in a way kind of</text><text start="781.019" dur="4.801">um a penalty so</text><text start="783.839" dur="4.5">in in other</text><text start="785.82" dur="5.12">um obviously the concept of web of trust</text><text start="788.339" dur="7.5">has been around uh for for a long time</text><text start="790.94" dur="7.24">uh going back to uh pgb uh pgp and and</text><text start="795.839" dur="4.8">of course also project like bright ID</text><text start="798.18" dur="6.959">and they are plenty</text><text start="800.639" dur="7.14">um but it&apos;s not always clear</text><text start="805.139" dur="5.161">um uh what it means</text><text start="807.779" dur="4.081">um or kind of how valuable is the</text><text start="810.3" dur="3.839">information that you are trusting</text><text start="811.86" dur="5.76">someone so in a way for example let&apos;s</text><text start="814.139" dur="6.841">say on on Facebook uh or on on Twitter</text><text start="817.62" dur="5.339">you like someone or you follow someone</text><text start="820.98" dur="4.08">um and the question is how</text><text start="822.959" dur="4.68">um yeah how how valuable is this</text><text start="825.06" dur="6.24">information and with circles there is an</text><text start="827.639" dur="5.82">interesting aspect that if you are</text><text start="831.3" dur="5.58">um if you are too loose</text><text start="833.459" dur="5.641">um with uh with trusting people so let&apos;s</text><text start="836.88" dur="4.62">say there&apos;s a random telegram group and</text><text start="839.1" dur="5.46">then people ask yeah please please trust</text><text start="841.5" dur="6.779">me and you trust them and you don&apos;t</text><text start="844.56" dur="5.94">actually kind of uh yeah well you don&apos;t</text><text start="848.279" dur="4.261">actually verify that it is</text><text start="850.5" dur="7.019">um a real person</text><text start="852.54" dur="7.979">um then in circles you are uh yeah you</text><text start="857.519" dur="3.721">are potentially losing money because</text><text start="860.519" dur="3.301">um</text><text start="861.24" dur="5.039">what you are doing by trusting them is</text><text start="863.82" dur="6.84">you are saying you accept</text><text start="866.279" dur="6.661">um their circles uh or even more and you</text><text start="870.66" dur="4.919">are willing to</text><text start="872.94" dur="7.079">um you are agreeing that they can</text><text start="875.579" dur="5.521">exchange their circles uh for yours and</text><text start="880.019" dur="4.38">now</text><text start="881.1" dur="4.739">um that means as soon as your circles</text><text start="884.399" dur="3.721">have</text><text start="885.839" dur="4.981">um have some value</text><text start="888.12" dur="5.7">um and that can easily be established by</text><text start="890.82" dur="5.879">you yourself putting up some liquidity</text><text start="893.82" dur="6.42">for your own personal circles</text><text start="896.699" dur="7.981">um then by trusting someone else you</text><text start="900.24" dur="7.68">essentially say that their tokens</text><text start="904.68" dur="4.62">um again have the same value so now this</text><text start="907.92" dur="4.14">other person</text><text start="909.3" dur="5.58">can take now now let&apos;s pretend this</text><text start="912.06" dur="5.399">other person is now indeed a bot or</text><text start="914.88" dur="5.28">someone who tries to um spam the system</text><text start="917.459" dur="5.341">and you kind of just blindly trust them</text><text start="920.16" dur="5.46">because you asked they ask yeah whatever</text><text start="922.8" dur="4.8">on telegram to to be trusted they can</text><text start="925.62" dur="4.14">now take their essentially worthless</text><text start="927.6" dur="4.56">tokens because you can obviously create</text><text start="929.76" dur="3.18">hundreds of accounts</text><text start="932.16" dur="4.26">um</text><text start="932.94" dur="5.519">and exchange them against your tokens</text><text start="936.42" dur="4.74">that actually have value because let&apos;s</text><text start="938.459" dur="6.24">say you simply put uh put up some</text><text start="941.16" dur="5.4">liquidity against the stable coin</text><text start="944.699" dur="6.181">um for them and yeah they can</text><text start="946.56" dur="6.36">essentially then train yeah or get you</text><text start="950.88" dur="4.8">you get a bunch of their personal tokens</text><text start="952.92" dur="4.62">uh and they they run away with with the</text><text start="955.68" dur="3.899">stable coin and now kind of their</text><text start="957.54" dur="4.68">personal tokens because others might</text><text start="959.579" dur="5.461">very well be more careful</text><text start="962.22" dur="5.04">um and will not trust this person then</text><text start="965.04" dur="4.859">essentially you end up with circles that</text><text start="967.26" dur="4.5">you can uh you can&apos;t use and you can&apos;t</text><text start="969.899" dur="5.101">spend anywhere in system</text><text start="971.76" dur="6.42">so uh yeah that&apos;s why there are kind of</text><text start="975.0" dur="4.62">those those two important uh economic</text><text start="978.18" dur="3.3">incentives there is an economic</text><text start="979.62" dur="4.8">incentive to get</text><text start="981.48" dur="4.32">um to get connected and to to build as</text><text start="984.42" dur="3.539">many trust connections as possible</text><text start="985.8" dur="4.02">because that means your circles are</text><text start="987.959" dur="3.18">valuable in the network because there</text><text start="989.82" dur="3.54">are people that</text><text start="991.139" dur="4.2">um are willing to accept them but at the</text><text start="993.36" dur="5.7">same time it&apos;s also important to not</text><text start="995.339" dur="6.12">connect to people uh that are yeah that</text><text start="999.06" dur="5.399">that where others don&apos;t want to connect</text><text start="1001.459" dur="4.5">to because yeah they yeah are fake</text><text start="1004.459" dur="4.141">accounts</text><text start="1005.959" dur="3.62">um and and in my view that&apos;s a very uh</text><text start="1008.6" dur="3.539">yeah</text><text start="1009.579" dur="4.0">important additional</text><text start="1012.139" dur="4.32">um dynamic</text><text start="1013.579" dur="4.981">yeah it&apos;s really a kind of an elegant</text><text start="1016.459" dur="5.341">design I think the way web of trust</text><text start="1018.56" dur="5.999">works with respect to the the identity</text><text start="1021.8" dur="4.619">system and um</text><text start="1024.559" dur="3.601">it&apos;s just kind of beautiful to see</text><text start="1026.419" dur="4.981">people experimenting with these regen</text><text start="1028.16" dur="4.919">mechanisms live in the wild I mean it</text><text start="1031.4" dur="3.0">seems like circles has gotten a good</text><text start="1033.079" dur="3.36">amount of adoption and that you&apos;re</text><text start="1034.4" dur="3.779">pouring some some resources into it so</text><text start="1036.439" dur="3.841">you know could you say what it what</text><text start="1038.179" dur="4.62">excites you about about working on this</text><text start="1040.28" dur="4.26">uh on this problem space uh after you&apos;ve</text><text start="1042.799" dur="3.361">had many other successful projects of</text><text start="1044.54" dur="3.0">course uh but I&apos;m you know I&apos;m curious</text><text start="1046.16" dur="3.18">what what kind of Lights you up about</text><text start="1047.54" dur="4.019">this specific one</text><text start="1049.34" dur="3.66">yeah for sure so</text><text start="1051.559" dur="3.24">um yeah a little bit of the uh his</text><text start="1053.0" dur="5.1">history of circles</text><text start="1054.799" dur="5.521">um we started or launched or kind of the</text><text start="1058.1" dur="4.56">ideas has been around for many many</text><text start="1060.32" dur="4.92">years I think seven or eight years or</text><text start="1062.66" dur="5.1">more I believe uh initially it was</text><text start="1065.24" dur="4.799">described as a fork of Bitcoin because</text><text start="1067.76" dur="5.0">back back in the days Bitcoin was the</text><text start="1070.039" dur="5.341">only thing that existed after many years</text><text start="1072.76" dur="5.02">and essentially ethereum coming along</text><text start="1075.38" dur="5.52">and making it possible to program a</text><text start="1077.78" dur="6.24">system like circles it launched um uh</text><text start="1080.9" dur="6.12">roughly two years ago and indeed</text><text start="1084.02" dur="5.94">um after the launch uh well there was</text><text start="1087.02" dur="6.779">quite significant hype within</text><text start="1089.96" dur="5.219">um three weeks uh roughly 200 000 people</text><text start="1093.799" dur="4.021">um signed up</text><text start="1095.179" dur="4.321">but then unfortunately</text><text start="1097.82" dur="5.7">um yeah kind of</text><text start="1099.5" dur="6.12">they&apos;re just it was it was still quite</text><text start="1103.52" dur="4.62">early so there were all kind of</text><text start="1105.62" dur="4.26">technical problems the team was very</text><text start="1108.14" dur="4.14">small it was actually just a two</text><text start="1109.88" dur="4.26">developer team so then kind of after</text><text start="1112.28" dur="5.34">this initial hype</text><text start="1114.14" dur="7.14">um things yeah slowed down significantly</text><text start="1117.62" dur="5.16">um and there was not uh for a while uh</text><text start="1121.28" dur="3.6">not much you could do with circles</text><text start="1122.78" dur="4.38">however now</text><text start="1124.88" dur="7.26">um two years later we are again in the</text><text start="1127.16" dur="6.48">in the um or we are now in a good period</text><text start="1132.14" dur="4.56">to</text><text start="1133.64" dur="5.779">um yeah reactivate or a lot of circles</text><text start="1136.7" dur="7.26">activity so there is a quite active</text><text start="1139.419" dur="7.181">local community in Berlin with yeah kind</text><text start="1143.96" dur="5.459">of weekend or at least monthly markets</text><text start="1146.6" dur="4.699">and uh and yeah quite a couple of places</text><text start="1149.419" dur="5.281">in Berlin where you can</text><text start="1151.299" dur="8.581">buy all all kind of things for circles</text><text start="1154.7" dur="8.7">there is a larger program in Indonesia</text><text start="1159.88" dur="6.52">and in Bali coming up where yeah where</text><text start="1163.4" dur="6.48">there&apos;s where there&apos;s a team planning a</text><text start="1166.4" dur="5.7">rollout on circles but also</text><text start="1169.88" dur="4.799">um for the yeah kind of for the initial</text><text start="1172.1" dur="5.579">crypto community that mainly signed up</text><text start="1174.679" dur="5.761">two years ago we are currently yeah</text><text start="1177.679" dur="5.161">planning some some relaunch and</text><text start="1180.44" dur="5.58">specifically this idea to bring</text><text start="1182.84" dur="4.02">um yeah bring liquidity behind your own</text><text start="1186.02" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="1186.86" dur="6.42">uh personal circuits what excites me</text><text start="1190.16" dur="4.56">about the project is still the question</text><text start="1193.28" dur="2.279">of</text><text start="1194.72" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="1195.559" dur="5.881">what is a good form</text><text start="1197.72" dur="6.0">um of money maybe uh yeah maybe maybe</text><text start="1201.44" dur="8.22">what&apos;s a good decentralized stable coin</text><text start="1203.72" dur="6.72">actually so uh so so far we are seeing</text><text start="1209.66" dur="2.82">um</text><text start="1210.44" dur="4.859">we are seeing all kind of stable coins</text><text start="1212.48" dur="4.86">and also all kind of stable coins</text><text start="1215.299" dur="5.461">um failing</text><text start="1217.34" dur="7.14">um and in circles to me has a promise to</text><text start="1220.76" dur="5.1">uh to be actually a a form of money that</text><text start="1224.48" dur="5.939">is used</text><text start="1225.86" dur="9.42">um yeah in in day-to-day transactions uh</text><text start="1230.419" dur="8.281">but that is deeply rooted in</text><text start="1235.28" dur="5.639">um existing social social relationships</text><text start="1238.7" dur="4.92">so it&apos;s not kind of just a</text><text start="1240.919" dur="5.161">um yeah some</text><text start="1243.62" dur="5.46">uh speculative bubble that&apos;s</text><text start="1246.08" dur="6.599">disconnected from from the actual</text><text start="1249.08" dur="7.62">economy ideally it&apos;s very uh very uh</text><text start="1252.679" dur="5.941">connected uh in yeah well in people so</text><text start="1256.7" dur="4.56">in a way the circles every every</text><text start="1258.62" dur="4.26">individual circle is in a way backed by</text><text start="1261.26" dur="4.26">the person</text><text start="1262.88" dur="5.52">um that is behind this behind that that</text><text start="1265.52" dur="7.08">Circle and so by the by the economic</text><text start="1268.4" dur="6.96">activity this person uh is is doing and</text><text start="1272.6" dur="4.56">of course its Network so everyone who is</text><text start="1275.36" dur="5.699">who&apos;s trusting this person that&apos;s really</text><text start="1277.16" dur="6.24">what Bex uh every individual Circle</text><text start="1281.059" dur="5.041">it&apos;s it&apos;s really interesting</text><text start="1283.4" dur="6.0">um for me to think about how powerful</text><text start="1286.1" dur="6.72">web of trust mechanisms can be</text><text start="1289.4" dur="5.159">um and and I think that the reason why I</text><text start="1292.82" dur="2.94">believe that they can be so powerful is</text><text start="1294.559" dur="3.0">that</text><text start="1295.76" dur="3.6">um web of trust is basically how Google</text><text start="1297.559" dur="3.841">invented pagerank and became the number</text><text start="1299.36" dur="4.62">one search engine in the world and a</text><text start="1301.4" dur="5.7">technology giant so every time you go</text><text start="1303.98" dur="4.92">and you uh when Larry and Sergey were</text><text start="1307.1" dur="4.5">writing pagerank they basically realized</text><text start="1308.9" dur="5.639">that any vote any link from one site to</text><text start="1311.6" dur="5.939">another site was a vote for that second</text><text start="1314.539" dur="5.941">site and you know if you distribute</text><text start="1317.539" dur="4.441">reputation points along a web of trust</text><text start="1320.48" dur="3.72">graph and that&apos;s basically what page</text><text start="1321.98" dur="4.559">rank is and it&apos;s really neat to see that</text><text start="1324.2" dur="5.099">algorithm be reapplied in the web 3</text><text start="1326.539" dur="4.741">ecosystem as people vote with each other</text><text start="1329.299" dur="4.441">over who has credibility and that</text><text start="1331.28" dur="3.779">creates legitimacy I think for pagerank</text><text start="1333.74" dur="4.38">because you always get the best stuff at</text><text start="1335.059" dur="5.1">the top but with respect to the monetary</text><text start="1338.12" dur="3.419">system inside of circles Ubi there&apos;s a</text><text start="1340.159" dur="3.181">similar amount of legitimacy that&apos;s</text><text start="1341.539" dur="4.26">bootstrapped there and it&apos;s just kind of</text><text start="1343.34" dur="3.66">a novel way of constructing an economy</text><text start="1345.799" dur="3.061">there so I don&apos;t know if you have any</text><text start="1347.0" dur="3.72">comments but that&apos;s you know for me the</text><text start="1348.86" dur="3.78">bleachers what what is it especially</text><text start="1350.72" dur="4.439">elegant about this mechanism</text><text start="1352.64" dur="5.7">yeah and and I I absolutely hope or we</text><text start="1355.159" dur="6.961">also want to make it easier to uh to use</text><text start="1358.34" dur="6.36">this web of trust graph uh in in other</text><text start="1362.12" dur="4.2">um contexts so I mean there are plenty</text><text start="1364.7" dur="4.459">of applications but one just very</text><text start="1366.32" dur="6.42">obvious one is let&apos;s say a rating system</text><text start="1369.159" dur="7.421">uh yeah which currently get gamed all</text><text start="1372.74" dur="6.78">the time uh by um by all kind of uh</text><text start="1376.58" dur="6.06">civil attack and Bot attacks so where</text><text start="1379.52" dur="7.139">you could very well imagine to vote to</text><text start="1382.64" dur="5.94">sorry to wait uh ratings by</text><text start="1386.659" dur="5.52">um the distance of that other person</text><text start="1388.58" dur="5.16">that is uh rating in in your web of</text><text start="1392.179" dur="3.24">trust graph so yeah</text><text start="1393.74" dur="4.559">so it seems like there&apos;s sort of an</text><text start="1395.419" dur="4.981">iterative process where uh or or like</text><text start="1398.299" dur="4.981">the attributes of the system is that the</text><text start="1400.4" dur="4.62">Ubi is paid at a a periodic interval</text><text start="1403.28"

mechanism</text><text start="1544.539" dur="6.041">yeah so</text><text start="1546.799" dur="6.721">um so as I said this is one</text><text start="1550.58" dur="5.16">um yeah we want to make it easier to</text><text start="1553.52" dur="6.42">uh for for people in a way to Signal</text><text start="1555.74" dur="7.26">they are serious about their own circles</text><text start="1559.94" dur="5.219">um and that is by or kind of one one</text><text start="1563.0" dur="4.08">easy or there are at least two</text><text start="1565.159" dur="5.281">mechanisms to do that and one will be to</text><text start="1567.08" dur="6.06">Simply put uh put some money behind</text><text start="1570.44" dur="5.339">um your own circles</text><text start="1573.14" dur="4.26">um yeah whatever could be uh die</text><text start="1575.779" dur="3.481">stablecoin</text><text start="1577.4" dur="5.94">um and and the other mechanism is of</text><text start="1579.26" dur="5.88">course to uh to concretely offer</text><text start="1583.34" dur="3.42">um offer things</text><text start="1585.14" dur="3.0">um that you let&apos;s say you&apos;re a</text><text start="1586.76" dur="4.32">freelancer and you are kind of saying</text><text start="1588.14" dur="5.46">I&apos;m I&apos;m willing to maybe not</text><text start="1591.08" dur="5.28">um yeah to to accept circles as a</text><text start="1593.6" dur="3.78">payment for for my work those those kind</text><text start="1596.36" dur="5.22">of things</text><text start="1597.38" dur="5.399">um yeah really really make make your own</text><text start="1601.58" dur="3.959">personal</text><text start="1602.779" dur="5.28">um circuits valuable and and so far</text><text start="1605.539" dur="6.541">um yeah we didn&apos;t really offer great</text><text start="1608.059" dur="6.061">ways to to do that so</text><text start="1612.08" dur="3.9">um that is coming</text><text start="1614.12" dur="4.86">um then</text><text start="1615.98" dur="3.86">as soon as those mechanisms are</text><text start="1618.98" dur="5.04">available</text><text start="1619.84" dur="5.8">we uh we are also working on a second</text><text start="1624.02" dur="3.539">concept</text><text start="1625.64" dur="5.96">um to form</text><text start="1627.559" dur="8.0">um groups so the the pure web of trust</text><text start="1631.6" dur="6.28">mechanism is is quite powerful but also</text><text start="1635.559" dur="4.061">uh complex</text><text start="1637.88" dur="4.5">um and and</text><text start="1639.62" dur="6.539">um makes a few use cases hard so you</text><text start="1642.38" dur="4.56">need to kind of remember if if you</text><text start="1646.159" dur="4.981">um</text><text start="1646.94" dur="7.2">if you trust 50 people let&apos;s say then</text><text start="1651.14" dur="5.94">your total Circle balance can actually</text><text start="1654.14" dur="4.38">be 50 different tokens of all those 50</text><text start="1657.08" dur="5.219">people</text><text start="1658.52" dur="7.92">um you trust and and and that makes uh</text><text start="1662.299" dur="7.461">that makes it a bit hard uh to integrate</text><text start="1666.44" dur="6.42">um to integrate circles into well the</text><text start="1669.76" dur="6.94">ethereum ecosystem so let&apos;s say even on</text><text start="1672.86" dur="6.919">uh on on git coin let&apos;s say some someone</text><text start="1676.7" dur="6.479">would want to accept circles donations</text><text start="1679.779" dur="6.061">then circuits isn&apos;t really exactly a</text><text start="1683.179" dur="4.921">specific token it&apos;s it&apos;s yeah it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="1685.84" dur="5.26">thousands ten thousand hundred thousands</text><text start="1688.1" dur="6.059">of tokens and again that that makes it</text><text start="1691.1" dur="5.88">just just practically uh harder to deal</text><text start="1694.159" dur="3.421">with it so</text><text start="1696.98" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="1697.58" dur="5.64">and and and the second issue is again uh</text><text start="1700.82" dur="5.16">in a way everyone is individually</text><text start="1703.22" dur="5.88">responsible for</text><text start="1705.98" dur="5.16">um for for making their um their own</text><text start="1709.1" dur="5.22">personal circles</text><text start="1711.14" dur="7.26">um valuable by again saying I I offer</text><text start="1714.32" dur="4.8">for something for it so groups can be</text><text start="1718.4" dur="4.62">um</text><text start="1719.12" dur="6.179">or groups are well are very very human</text><text start="1723.02" dur="3.899">human thing and kind of if you want to</text><text start="1725.299" dur="4.201">uh</text><text start="1726.919" dur="5.101">um yeah get something done like a</text><text start="1729.5" dur="5.52">universal basic income it always relies</text><text start="1732.02" dur="4.86">on on groups so kind of if you are alone</text><text start="1735.02" dur="3.6">on the world you cannot receive a basic</text><text start="1736.88" dur="4.2">income so you will always receive a</text><text start="1738.62" dur="4.98">basic income from from your your group</text><text start="1741.08" dur="7.199">from from a community</text><text start="1743.6" dur="7.14">um so with groups or we we add a layer</text><text start="1748.279" dur="7.441">to circles where</text><text start="1750.74" dur="7.86">um you can simply Define a group and</text><text start="1755.72" dur="5.939">that can there can be various rules so</text><text start="1758.6" dur="6.6">it could be a group could be a Dao where</text><text start="1761.659" dur="5.88">where there&apos;s some some process to be to</text><text start="1765.2" dur="4.56">get become a member of the group but a</text><text start="1767.539" dur="4.981">group could also be based on some</text><text start="1769.76" dur="5.159">attestation so a group could be you need</text><text start="1772.52" dur="5.159">to do this um</text><text start="1774.919" dur="4.98">uh this verification process whether</text><text start="1777.679" dur="5.941">it&apos;s Biometrics or kind of there&apos;s this</text><text start="1779.899" dur="6.66">proof of humanity uh with this</text><text start="1783.62" dur="5.46">kind of or there are a bunch of bunch of</text><text start="1786.559" dur="5.881">bunch of processes to</text><text start="1789.08" dur="6.9">um in each of those uh could be a um a</text><text start="1792.44" dur="5.58">group and now uh we are able to say okay</text><text start="1795.98" dur="4.5">let&apos;s say there are a thousand circuits</text><text start="1798.02" dur="5.94">accounts that um</text><text start="1800.48" dur="4.799">that uh all yeah belong to a specific</text><text start="1803.96" dur="5.28">group</text><text start="1805.279" dur="6.26">um then we can uh create</text><text start="1809.24" dur="6.36">um yeah kind of a circles group token</text><text start="1811.539" dur="6.161">that is exclusively backed by the</text><text start="1815.6" dur="4.319">individual circles so essentially it</text><text start="1817.7" dur="5.94">means if you are a member of that group</text><text start="1819.919" dur="5.88">you get the right to take your personal</text><text start="1823.64" dur="4.56">circles and put it kind of into the</text><text start="1825.799" dur="5.581">group contract and and mint at that</text><text start="1828.2" dur="7.859">moment the same amount of those those</text><text start="1831.38" dur="8.22">group circuits so now it&apos;s a bit easier</text><text start="1836.059" dur="6.301">simply to to do things like</text><text start="1839.6" dur="5.88">um yeah establish liquidity</text><text start="1842.36" dur="6.66">um or establish simply value or trust in</text><text start="1845.48" dur="5.22">in that um in that um yeah in a way</text><text start="1849.02" dur="4.2">Circle or group circle because again</text><text start="1850.7" dur="5.16">it&apos;s now no longer backed by a single</text><text start="1853.22" dur="6.12">individual but by a group and obviously</text><text start="1855.86" dur="4.62">groups can be yeah can be more powerful</text><text start="1859.34" dur="4.199">I guess</text><text start="1860.48" dur="5.699">yeah I I I&apos;d be really interested to see</text><text start="1863.539" dur="4.38">you know how we can how I&apos;m saying we as</text><text start="1866.179" dur="3.541">in the Royal we but like this ecosystem</text><text start="1867.919" dur="3.301">can create interop between all these</text><text start="1869.72" dur="4.079">different web of trusts and reputation</text><text start="1871.22" dur="4.64">systems that are being created the IDS</text><text start="1873.799" dur="4.681">verifiable credentials Soul bound tokens</text><text start="1875.86" dur="5.679">civil resistance is just so high upside</text><text start="1878.48" dur="4.38">for the web that uh it&apos;s I wonder if</text><text start="1881.539" dur="3.601">there&apos;s a way that the sum of all these</text><text start="1882.86" dur="3.72">systems can be worth more than uh each</text><text start="1885.14" dur="3.18">of their parts and you know by these</text><text start="1886.58" dur="3.12">systems I I&apos;m thinking of all the green</text><text start="1888.32" dur="5.04">pill episodes we&apos;ve done on civil</text><text start="1889.7" dur="6.66">resistance uh get coin password World</text><text start="1893.36" dur="4.799">coin bright ID proof of humanity all of</text><text start="1896.36" dur="3.66">these things it feels like there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="1898.159" dur="4.02">of great experimentation in the area and</text><text start="1900.02" dur="4.379">I can&apos;t wait to just see us have more of</text><text start="1902.179" dur="4.021">a one person one vote money Lego it&apos;s</text><text start="1904.399" dur="4.681">gonna be really powerful</text><text start="1906.2" dur="6.359">yeah for sure for sure and yeah we are</text><text start="1909.08" dur="6.599">aware of all those other uh and yeah are</text><text start="1912.559" dur="6.0">happy to connect uh as as much as</text><text start="1915.679" dur="5.521">possible uh on this node it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1918.559" dur="6.72">quite a technicality but I think it&apos;s an</text><text start="1921.2" dur="6.42">important one uh in in circles we have</text><text start="1925.279" dur="3.061">uh very early on</text><text start="1927.62" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="1928.34" dur="5.28">decided that</text><text start="1930.5" dur="5.64">um uh smart contracts smart contract</text><text start="1933.62" dur="5.939">identities are important</text><text start="1936.14" dur="5.399">um so every Circle user is actually</text><text start="1939.559" dur="5.22">um yeah kind of a noses safe and the</text><text start="1941.539" dur="5.76">important thing here is that um that we</text><text start="1944.779" dur="5.88">believe that is a much more</text><text start="1947.299" dur="6.0">um durable identity than</text><text start="1950.659" dur="5.101">um your private key because sooner or</text><text start="1953.299" dur="4.441">later you will your key might get</text><text start="1955.76" dur="4.139">compromised or you</text><text start="1957.74" dur="4.679">um you you lose your key</text><text start="1959.899" dur="5.28">um so we don&apos;t think that is a that&apos;s a</text><text start="1962.419" dur="6.421">good thing for an identity that ideally</text><text start="1965.179" dur="6.541">you could use for for your whole life</text><text start="1968.84" dur="6.3">um a smart contract uh yeah allows you</text><text start="1971.72" dur="6.0">to uh well to change the key later to</text><text start="1975.14" dur="5.779">upgrade the key to upgrade the account</text><text start="1977.72" dur="7.74">to have social recovery</text><text start="1980.919" dur="6.161">mechanisms so yeah we see or yeah</text><text start="1985.46" dur="3.78">whether you want to use the word sold on</text><text start="1987.08" dur="4.62">token but but</text><text start="1989.24" dur="3.539">um yeah an identity in our view cannot</text><text start="1991.7" dur="3.42">be a</text><text start="1992.779" dur="5.221">um cannot be a</text><text start="1995.12" dur="5.58">private public key pair</text><text start="1998.0" dur="4.5">truly neat that uh yeah that you&apos;re</text><text start="2000.7" dur="3.719">reusing gnosis safe there it feels like</text><text start="2002.5" dur="3.419">there&apos;s a strategic complementariness</text><text start="2004.419" dur="4.14">between the different products and the</text><text start="2005.919" dur="4.26">gnosis safe portfolio or sorry in the</text><text start="2008.559" dur="3.541">gnosis portfolio and then probably The</text><text start="2010.179" dur="4.201">Wider ecosystem of money Legos as well</text><text start="2012.1" dur="4.34">so uh I think that that&apos;s really cool</text><text start="2014.38" dur="4.5">what um</text><text start="2016.44" dur="5.02">I I guess like zooming out a little bit</text><text start="2018.88" dur="4.26">I&apos;d I&apos;d be I&apos;d be curious sort of I know</text><text start="2021.46" dur="3.54">that you&apos;re really involved in gnosis</text><text start="2023.14" dur="4.139">and I know that gnosis has multiple</text><text start="2025.0" dur="6.179">products uh safe just spun out on its</text><text start="2027.279" dur="6.061">own uh do you see you know zooming out</text><text start="2031.179" dur="4.441">do you see uh circles eventually</text><text start="2033.34" dur="3.9">spinning out of gnosis one day also uh</text><text start="2035.62" dur="4.14">is that kind of the model that y&apos;all are</text><text start="2037.24" dur="5.36">uh moving towards is incubating projects</text><text start="2039.76" dur="2.84">and then spinning them out</text><text start="2043.059" dur="5.761">um yeah although I think circles is is</text><text start="2045.34" dur="6.24">an exception uh so with the gnosis we</text><text start="2048.82" dur="5.4">did well initially we we started with</text><text start="2051.58" dur="5.099">prediction markets uh but back then</text><text start="2054.22" dur="4.5">simply so much infrastructure was</text><text start="2056.679" dur="5.101">missing like like a wallet so</text><text start="2058.72" dur="5.699">essentially the the uh the backstory of</text><text start="2061.78" dur="4.379">often also safe is that many years ago</text><text start="2064.419" dur="3.48">we wanted to do a token sale but there</text><text start="2066.159" dur="3.901">was no logistic wallet that could handle</text><text start="2067.899" dur="5.52">tokens so we wrote a multi-stick handle</text><text start="2070.06" dur="4.859">that uh modestik that can handle tokens</text><text start="2073.419" dur="4.621">um and that then later became the north</text><text start="2074.919" dur="8.76">to save then other things like uh count</text><text start="2078.04" dur="7.74">swap uh also were initially meant to or</text><text start="2083.679" dur="4.561">well we wanted to build prediction</text><text start="2085.78" dur="4.68">markets uh there were no really</text><text start="2088.24" dur="4.619">exchanges or decentralized exchanges so</text><text start="2090.46" dur="5.04">we needed to work on those on those</text><text start="2092.859" dur="6.361">first and those two projects then later</text><text start="2095.5" dur="7.74">um spun out of the of noses circles uh</text><text start="2099.22" dur="7.44">is is an exception because on circles uh</text><text start="2103.24" dur="4.859">was never part of gnosis so with circles</text><text start="2106.66" dur="4.56">the only</text><text start="2108.099" dur="7.02">um the only connection is is me</text><text start="2111.22" dur="6.42">um I yeah again came up with the idea of</text><text start="2115.119" dur="5.881">circles many years ago but then a</text><text start="2117.64" dur="6.18">community formed around this idea and</text><text start="2121.0" dur="5.7">when circles was launching uh two years</text><text start="2123.82" dur="5.82">ago I was actually just</text><text start="2126.7" dur="6.54">just on the sidelines in involved and I</text><text start="2129.64" dur="6.479">kind of always tried to support uh the</text><text start="2133.24" dur="5.28">yeah various teams that have been</text><text start="2136.119" dur="4.441">working on or around circles</text><text start="2138.52" dur="5.22">um over the years but yeah it was never</text><text start="2140.56" dur="5.58">it was never knows this project however</text><text start="2143.74" dur="5.4">now there is there is a another</text><text start="2146.14" dur="5.34">connection again and and and and nurses</text><text start="2149.14" dur="6.62">will probably yeah or will probably</text><text start="2151.48" dur="9.06">start start to supporting circles uh</text><text start="2155.76" dur="8.38">more because circles launched on</text><text start="2160.54" dur="6.059">a big yeah two years ago the the</text><text start="2164.14" dur="4.62">ethereum was obviously way too expensive</text><text start="2166.599" dur="4.201">I guess price wise for for a project</text><text start="2168.76" dur="4.319">like circuits right where the intention</text><text start="2170.8" dur="4.799">is you can make a payment you can</text><text start="2173.079" dur="6.121">whatever you can pay your coffee with it</text><text start="2175.599" dur="6.601">um so it launched on on xdi uh one of</text><text start="2179.2" dur="5.159">the few side chains uh available</text><text start="2182.2" dur="6.659">um at the time and</text><text start="2184.359" dur="8.341">yeah uh a year ago noses merged with xdi</text><text start="2188.859" dur="7.381">and and turned yeah xdi into into gnosis</text><text start="2192.7" dur="6.24">chain and now kind of um uh that is</text><text start="2196.24" dur="4.68">actually our large focus on nurses so</text><text start="2198.94" dur="5.04">safe and car swap are spun out and</text><text start="2200.92" dur="6.24">gnosis is now really kind of uh doing</text><text start="2203.98" dur="5.879">noses chain and circles is one of the</text><text start="2207.16" dur="4.98">one of the uh most important</text><text start="2209.859" dur="3.541">applications on noses chain so in that</text><text start="2212.14" dur="4.14">sense</text><text start="2213.4" dur="5.52">um there is now the connection again and</text><text start="2216.28" dur="5.94">gnosis will certainly support the</text><text start="2218.92" dur="6.06">support circuits however it can</text><text start="2222.22" dur="4.92">right it&apos;s really neat how your gnosis</text><text start="2224.98" dur="4.619">is kind of incubating this house of</text><text start="2227.14" dur="6.42">Brands uh you know nurses chain nose is</text><text start="2229.599" dur="6.661">safe Cal swap uh circles Ubi and you</text><text start="2233.56" dur="4.98">know for me as you may know I recently</text><text start="2236.26" dur="3.42">left get going down and I&apos;m no longer in</text><text start="2238.54" dur="2.819">a leadership position there and they</text><text start="2239.68" dur="3.96">have their own independent autonomous</text><text start="2241.359" dur="4.5">governance and I think that this like</text><text start="2243.64" dur="4.62">super modularity where you have each</text><text start="2245.859" dur="4.621">product has its own governance and</text><text start="2248.26" dur="4.2">contains scope but there&apos;s strategic</text><text start="2250.48" dur="4.5">complementaries between each of the</text><text start="2252.46" dur="4.2">things uh is a really elegant way to</text><text start="2254.98" dur="2.879">build a house of Brands and to just do</text><text start="2256.66" dur="3.3">more than you would be able to do with</text><text start="2257.859" dur="4.621">one large monolith so I&apos;m seeing some</text><text start="2259.96" dur="4.98">parallels between what you&apos;re doing uh</text><text start="2262.48" dur="3.96">with with what what we&apos;ve been doing in</text><text start="2264.94" dur="3.179">in that respect</text><text start="2266.44" dur="4.139">um although gnosis is huge and very</text><text start="2268.119" dur="5.22">successful and so I&apos;m a big Fanboy of</text><text start="2270.579" dur="4.321">yours as well so uh it&apos;s neat to see</text><text start="2273.339" dur="3.601">that as an example</text><text start="2274.9" dur="4.8">yeah I hope I hope actually that this</text><text start="2276.94" dur="5.46">model um or what we certainly did then</text><text start="2279.7" dur="5.58">is that all those projects or they they</text><text start="2282.4" dur="5.939">spun out of nurses they often create</text><text start="2285.28" dur="5.339">their own uh on tokens although circuits</text><text start="2288.339" dur="4.5">has no circuits against the exception</text><text start="2290.619" dur="4.921">year but the other is to create their</text><text start="2292.839" dur="6.541">own tokens and I think it&apos;s a super well</text><text start="2295.54" dur="5.52">important model then to or model I very</text><text start="2299.38" dur="4.44">much like and would like to see even</text><text start="2301.06" dur="4.26">much more is than those yeah shared</text><text start="2303.82" dur="4.08">incentives and it&apos;s actually very easy</text><text start="2305.32" dur="4.88">with tokens you can do those token swaps</text><text start="2307.9" dur="4.679">and you can do you can do</text><text start="2310.2" dur="4.72">bonding curves of tokens against each</text><text start="2312.579" dur="5.101">other I would actually like to see this</text><text start="2314.92" dur="4.98">uh much much more even much much more</text><text start="2317.68" dur="4.8">happening in the industry that</text><text start="2319.9" dur="5.4">um I mean so many projects are kind of</text><text start="2322.48" dur="5.22">dependent on each other we are building</text><text start="2325.3" dur="3.74">this super composable</text><text start="2327.7" dur="5.639">um yeah</text><text start="2329.04" dur="7.48">ecosystem and and I think it&apos;s uh yeah</text><text start="2333.339" dur="6.121">it&apos;s it&apos;s always good to do that as much</text><text start="2336.52" dur="4.079">as possible to have uh yeah shared</text><text start="2339.46" dur="4.56">incentives</text><text start="2340.599" dur="6.541">well I think the uh your hit rate is is</text><text start="2344.02" dur="4.98">really cool uh I I I hope to not be a</text><text start="2347.14" dur="3.24">one-hit wonder uh and not just be known</text><text start="2349.0" dur="3.06">as the get-going guy for the rest of my</text><text start="2350.38" dur="3.719">career and I hope to have multiple hits</text><text start="2352.06" dur="3.9">as well so uh it&apos;s it&apos;s been</text><text start="2354.099" dur="2.821">inspirational what you&apos;ve been doing is</text><text start="2355.96" dur="3.74">there anything that I didn&apos;t ask you</text><text start="2356.92" dur="2.78">that you want to say Martin</text><text start="2360.7" dur="3.48">um no I think</text><text start="2362.099" dur="5.26">covered it okay</text><text start="2364.18" dur="6.54">well um maybe a place to end is uh where</text><text start="2367.359" dur="7.381">can people find you in circles online</text><text start="2370.72" dur="5.7">yeah um so the uh website is joint</text><text start="2374.74" dur="3.839">circles</text><text
