start="245.879" dur="3.121">are like oh my God public goods are good</text><text start="247.56" dur="2.879">or whatever and then you just come back</text><text start="249.0" dur="2.36">you&apos;re like oh don&apos;t forget you&apos;re a</text><text start="250.439" dur="2.94">nobody</text><text start="251.36" dur="4.779">don&apos;t forget to pick up the kids from</text><text start="253.379" dur="5.281">school exactly I&apos;ll say that</text><text start="256.139" dur="4.141">um well uh let&apos;s let&apos;s dive in so I want</text><text start="258.66" dur="2.699">to talk about I want to talk about root</text><text start="260.28" dur="3.02">I want to talk about the work that</text><text start="261.359" dur="5.221">you&apos;ve been doing in the ecosystem</text><text start="263.3" dur="5.56">and you&apos;re writing a book so what&apos;s</text><text start="266.58" dur="4.44">What&apos;s the title of the book title book</text><text start="268.86" dur="3.6">is what information wants okay let&apos;s</text><text start="271.02" dur="4.619">start there what does information want</text><text start="272.46" dur="4.679">recently Mark well information well the</text><text start="275.639" dur="3.84">first thing I want to note is um yeah</text><text start="277.139" dur="5.28">the book is going to be a uh a visual</text><text start="279.479" dur="5.341">book and it&apos;s been uh inspired by in in</text><text start="282.419" dur="4.321">a walk he sent me his figma and so you</text><text start="284.82" dur="4.02">know I just kind of duplicated the figma</text><text start="286.74" dur="3.54">and I have my own little figma that you</text><text start="288.84" dur="2.94">can check out online</text><text start="290.28" dur="3.3">um and so that&apos;s how kind of how I&apos;m</text><text start="291.78" dur="3.84">building it so so thank you for your</text><text start="293.58" dur="3.36">open sourcing all the things yeah happy</text><text start="295.62" dur="4.82">too uh it&apos;s almost like information</text><text start="296.94" dur="6.78">wants to be copied oh my God</text><text start="300.44" dur="5.56">Alpha leak it&apos;s true um yeah so</text><text start="303.72" dur="4.979">information does it wants to be copied</text><text start="306.0" dur="4.199">and so so the idea behind the book is</text><text start="308.699" dur="3.901">that um</text><text start="310.199" dur="4.081">yeah we&apos;re in the information age and in</text><text start="312.6" dur="2.7">order to understand the information age</text><text start="314.28" dur="2.88">we need to understand information</text><text start="315.3" dur="3.48">Through the Ages</text><text start="317.16" dur="4.259">um and so what you can look at is these</text><text start="318.78" dur="4.16">patterns that emerge over time and those</text><text start="321.419" dur="5.461">patterns you could call them information</text><text start="322.94" dur="6.16">and those informational patterns are</text><text start="326.88" dur="3.48">um at the beginning it was you know buff</text><text start="329.1" dur="2.46">you know before life we don&apos;t really</text><text start="330.36" dur="2.94">need to talk about that but once life</text><text start="331.56" dur="3.54">emerged these replicators start to</text><text start="333.3" dur="3.3">emerge these genes and then they</text><text start="335.1" dur="3.599">replicate it to create the whole tree of</text><text start="336.6" dur="3.599">lights and then now we have these memes</text><text start="338.699" dur="4.081">these memetic replicators that create</text><text start="340.199" dur="4.381">the whole tree of ideas and Technology</text><text start="342.78" dur="3.18">um we have computers who are coming with</text><text start="344.58" dur="3.0">this new replicator that we can talk</text><text start="345.96" dur="4.44">about later but um yeah information</text><text start="347.58" dur="4.74">wants to uh it kind of wants to be free</text><text start="350.4" dur="4.2">it kind of wants to not be free the main</text><text start="352.32" dur="3.599">thing it wants is to be replicated</text><text start="354.6" dur="4.2">mm-hmm</text><text start="355.919" dur="4.681">got it so there&apos;s an explosion of the</text><text start="358.8" dur="6.0">universe for the Big Bang Cosmic</text><text start="360.6" dur="6.599">Evolution for for for many years but um</text><text start="364.8" dur="4.14">and in in in in some way I I don&apos;t know</text><text start="367.199" dur="3.06">if you view that as information but it</text><text start="368.94" dur="2.64">feels like the real unlocked for</text><text start="370.259" dur="3.961">information comes when you build</text><text start="371.58" dur="4.38">replicators into these information it</text><text start="374.22" dur="4.46">starts with genes and it gets into memes</text><text start="375.96" dur="6.72">and then what&apos;s the last one is</text><text start="378.68" dur="5.38">okay computer memes yeah so the okay the</text><text start="382.68" dur="4.079">idea is</text><text start="384.06" dur="3.78">yeah so I like to think of it as um in</text><text start="386.759" dur="3.361">the book you can imagine the book is</text><text start="387.84" dur="4.74">like a Sapient style big history book or</text><text start="390.12" dur="3.78">Cosmic Evolution book and at the</text><text start="392.58" dur="3.72">beginning</text><text start="393.9" dur="4.919">um yeah before replicators with the big</text><text start="396.3" dur="4.08">bang There was</text><text start="398.819" dur="3.421">um the environment was still providing</text><text start="400.38" dur="4.56">puzzles but the puzzle that it was</text><text start="402.24" dur="4.679">providing was something like okay we</text><text start="404.94" dur="5.16">have gravity we have electromagnetism</text><text start="406.919" dur="5.34">what kinds of celestial objects in</text><text start="410.1" dur="4.08">Celestial species will emerge</text><text start="412.259" dur="4.681">um that kind of fit those environmental</text><text start="414.18" dur="3.959">niches those kind of puzzles and um the</text><text start="416.94" dur="3.66">things that emerge were all these</text><text start="418.139" dur="4.741">orbiting blobs so galaxies are these</text><text start="420.6" dur="3.3">like big orbiting blobs solar systems</text><text start="422.88" dur="3.12">and planets are kind of like</text><text start="423.9" dur="4.68">middle-sized orbiting blobs and things</text><text start="426.0" dur="4.259">like atoms electrons moving around an</text><text start="428.58" dur="2.7">atom are kind of like small orbiting</text><text start="430.259" dur="2.461">blobs</text><text start="431.28" dur="3.72">um and so you have all these orbiting</text><text start="432.72" dur="4.38">blobs that are the answers to the puzzle</text><text start="435.0" dur="4.44">from the environment and then later as</text><text start="437.1" dur="4.56">you note but none of those replicate a a</text><text start="439.44" dur="4.5">sun doesn&apos;t want to make more Suns it</text><text start="441.66" dur="5.22">doesn&apos;t have kind of an agentful View</text><text start="443.94" dur="4.74">you on on Society on reality but once we</text><text start="446.88" dur="3.78">get uh replicators genes memes then</text><text start="448.68" dur="4.799">those things do want to replicate do you</text><text start="450.66" dur="4.8">think of like um you know recent I had a</text><text start="453.479" dur="3.301">dinner at Devcon where we got they&apos;re</text><text start="455.46" dur="3.179">deep on this and so I&apos;m just trying to</text><text start="456.78" dur="4.199">call that back in my mind but we&apos;re</text><text start="458.639" dur="3.84">talking about how uh entropy and the</text><text start="460.979" dur="3.181">fact that within a sun you&apos;re creating</text><text start="462.479" dur="3.901">more and more complex elements and then</text><text start="464.16" dur="7.02">those eventually get exploded out those</text><text start="466.38" dur="7.02">almost provide the the atomic Legos that</text><text start="471.18" dur="4.079">that serve for the replicators so it&apos;s</text><text start="473.4" dur="3.9">almost like entropy is what is leading</text><text start="475.259" dur="3.84">to more complex patterns and and</text><text start="477.3" dur="4.98">information games that can make</text><text start="479.099" dur="5.401">information to self-replication yeah I</text><text start="482.28" dur="3.539">think I think I think there&apos;s a the way</text><text start="484.5" dur="3.599">so totally agree with that the way I</text><text start="485.819" dur="5.041">kind of think about that is um you get</text><text start="488.099" dur="4.5">these beautiful you know Suns start with</text><text start="490.86" dur="4.38">hydrogen healing that&apos;s how the universe</text><text start="492.599" dur="4.861">are and then you get this amazing thing</text><text start="495.24" dur="4.26">where the hydrogen and helium it um gets</text><text start="497.46" dur="4.799">turned into more intense elements and</text><text start="499.5" dur="4.319">and stars and then those get exploded</text><text start="502.259" dur="3.481">out and then we get things in planets</text><text start="503.819" dur="3.541">and then with when you&apos;re in a watery</text><text start="505.74" dur="3.42">Planet like ours</text><text start="507.36" dur="3.66">um you can have a very promiscuous</text><text start="509.16" dur="3.84">molecule like carbon you know there&apos;s</text><text start="511.02" dur="4.319">200 or sorry like an element like carbon</text><text start="513.0" dur="4.56">200 different elements but only the</text><text start="515.339" dur="4.62">organic ones carbon and a couple others</text><text start="517.56" dur="4.859">are the ones who are actually</text><text start="519.959" dur="5.101">um can actually turn into these like new</text><text start="522.419" dur="4.561">kinds of patterns and so you the carbon</text><text start="525.06" dur="3.719">starts to link up with other carbons and</text><text start="526.98" dur="3.12">start to just try out what if I look</text><text start="528.779" dur="2.761">like this what if I look like this what</text><text start="530.1" dur="3.48">if I look like this and eventually you</text><text start="531.54" dur="4.02">get a thing that has an auto catalytic</text><text start="533.58" dur="3.24">reaction that produces more copies of</text><text start="535.56" dur="4.74">itself</text><text start="536.82" dur="4.86">um that then is able to beat and entropy</text><text start="540.3" dur="2.7">so entropy is trying to take things and</text><text start="541.68" dur="3.36">turn them down and trying to</text><text start="543.0" dur="3.959">de-patternize things while this is</text><text start="545.04" dur="3.96">saying wait a second let&apos;s like move up</text><text start="546.959" dur="3.901">the entropy gradient and create</text><text start="549.0" dur="4.86">something that needs energy in order to</text><text start="550.86" dur="4.5">keep on creating patterns of itself and</text><text start="553.86" dur="3.599">so it&apos;s kind of pushing against entropy</text><text start="555.36" dur="3.96">there</text><text start="557.459" dur="3.901">great well really looking for the book</text><text start="559.32" dur="3.959">forward to the book and uh hopefully</text><text start="561.36" dur="4.26">we&apos;re gonna get some some Alpha leak of</text><text start="563.279" dur="4.201">some of the best content that you got in</text><text start="565.62" dur="3.12">there what are the themes of how</text><text start="567.48" dur="4.56">replicators work are you really</text><text start="568.74" dur="5.279">interested in exploring in this book</text><text start="572.04" dur="3.78">interesting I think I mean the</text><text start="574.019" dur="3.481">to really uh and don&apos;t worry everyone</text><text start="575.82" dur="2.94">will get the alpha leak you know and um</text><text start="577.5" dur="3.72">and as a side note by the way the book</text><text start="578.76" dur="4.5">is being produced in public uh every</text><text start="581.22" dur="3.239">month on uh this thing called the inter</text><text start="583.26" dur="3.24">intellect so I have a little Salon</text><text start="584.459" dur="3.841">series that occurs and so you can like</text><text start="586.5" dur="3.899">come and chat with me about like the</text><text start="588.3" dur="4.02">most than the most recent chapter</text><text start="590.399" dur="3.481">um so there&apos;s Alpha leak every month um</text><text start="592.32" dur="5.16">if you want it</text><text start="593.88" dur="5.34">um the other crucial bits of it are like</text><text start="597.48" dur="3.24">I mean the key idea behind the book is</text><text start="599.22" dur="3.84">like I was just trying to</text><text start="600.72" dur="4.44">get as close to like the base layer of</text><text start="603.06" dur="4.02">reality as possible in order to</text><text start="605.16" dur="4.02">understand this next big transition for</text><text start="607.08" dur="4.92">Humanity and so</text><text start="609.18" dur="5.82">um what I&apos;m and so but in order to do</text><text start="612.0" dur="5.04">that you can&apos;t just look at history</text><text start="615.0" dur="4.38">since the year 2000 and blah blah</text><text start="617.04" dur="3.12">instacart this into insta chat that</text><text start="619.38" dur="3.66">whatever</text><text start="620.16" dur="4.739">um you have to kind of go deeper back in</text><text start="623.04" dur="3.6">time and not just humans and not just</text><text start="624.899" dur="3.181">and so that&apos;s kind of it&apos;s trying to</text><text start="626.64" dur="3.96">understand how these core patterns</text><text start="628.08" dur="5.58">emerge in order to really make sense of</text><text start="630.6" dur="5.46">today&apos;s reality and so I think that the</text><text start="633.66" dur="3.96">things that I&apos;m excited to explore are</text><text start="636.06" dur="4.8">you know when you can imagine something</text><text start="637.62" dur="4.98">like um you know within the the green</text><text start="640.86" dur="5.28">pill and adjacent ecosystems it&apos;s like</text><text start="642.6" dur="4.859">how can we as a as a people create</text><text start="646.14" dur="3.66">these like</text><text start="647.459" dur="4.141">um these symbiotic ecosystems with each</text><text start="649.8" dur="3.659">other where we do want to make these</text><text start="651.6" dur="4.08">replicators but those replicators exist</text><text start="653.459" dur="4.981">kind of in co-evolutionary symbiotic</text><text start="655.68" dur="5.7">environments instead of just like you</text><text start="658.44" dur="5.04">know win lose kind of um uh kind of</text><text start="661.38" dur="3.84">alpha predator environments</text><text start="663.48" dur="3.78">um yeah yeah so I&apos;m curious about I&apos;m</text><text start="665.22" dur="4.38">I&apos;m very excited I think I hope the book</text><text start="667.26" dur="3.96">will be relatively actionable book about</text><text start="669.6" dur="3.72">the kinds of</text><text start="671.22" dur="5.76">both memes that are spreading in society</text><text start="673.32" dur="5.4">like BLM or you know metoo or Maga</text><text start="676.98" dur="3.24">um the kinds of why cryptos is a</text><text start="678.72" dur="3.66">powerful Meme and why it&apos;s spreading and</text><text start="680.22" dur="5.04">so like that major connected to the</text><text start="682.38" dur="3.959">present isn&apos;t a crucial piece right yeah</text><text start="685.26" dur="3.72">well I mean there&apos;s two things that</text><text start="686.339" dur="3.781">really come well there&apos;s a bunch of</text><text start="688.98" dur="3.66">stuff that&apos;s really interesting but the</text><text start="690.12" dur="3.6">two things that stand out to me are this</text><text start="692.64" dur="2.58">idea that we&apos;re moving into the</text><text start="693.72" dur="4.859">information age and so you want to get</text><text start="695.22" dur="5.7">into the base level of reality uh first</text><text start="698.579" dur="4.021">principles about information in order to</text><text start="700.92" dur="3.659">understand the information age that&apos;s</text><text start="702.6" dur="3.6">interesting to me but also what are the</text><text start="704.579" dur="2.94">parallels that we can learn so okay so</text><text start="706.2" dur="5.879">like if we&apos;re speed running the</text><text start="707.519" dur="7.56">evolution of kemetics and mimetics uh</text><text start="712.079" dur="4.621">what is there to learn from biology in</text><text start="715.079" dur="3.061">genes replicating then and you know and</text><text start="716.7" dur="3.18">that leads me to I&apos;ve had this theory</text><text start="718.14" dur="3.96">about web3 is that we&apos;re speed running</text><text start="719.88" dur="4.139">the history of finance and</text><text start="722.1" dur="3.96">um and we&apos;re building this ecosystem how</text><text start="724.019" dur="3.301">do we speed run past like the Ponzi</text><text start="726.06" dur="2.64">schemes and the scams which are</text><text start="727.32" dur="3.12">basically like the Cancers and the</text><text start="728.7" dur="4.92">viruses and how do we get to like</text><text start="730.44" dur="5.579">mycelial Network or dolphins or humans</text><text start="733.62" dur="4.38">like the apex predators but like</text><text start="736.019" dur="3.661">hopefully another thing that we talked</text><text start="738.0" dur="3.42">about in the Greg Lando episode which is</text><text start="739.68" dur="3.48">like episode six or something was</text><text start="741.42" dur="3.24">keystone species like species that</text><text start="743.16" dur="2.88">Define the ecological niche for everyone</text><text start="744.66" dur="3.06">else and what you really want is the</text><text start="746.04" dur="3.78">Keystone these species that creates</text><text start="747.72" dur="4.739">anti-fragility for the rest of the</text><text start="749.82" dur="3.48">ecosystem instead of like one that&apos;s</text><text start="752.459" dur="3.421">gonna</text><text start="753.3" dur="4.2">explode you know so so I don&apos;t know like</text><text start="755.88" dur="2.94">that&apos;s kind of where my mind goes and</text><text start="757.5" dur="3.36">I&apos;m curious if that brings up anything</text><text start="758.82" dur="3.84">for you I mean I love all that I think</text><text start="760.86" dur="3.36">that&apos;s great I think um yeah I would</text><text start="762.66" dur="4.679">call something like ethereum as a</text><text start="764.22" dur="5.72">keystone species it is a underlying kind</text><text start="767.339" dur="5.041">of protocol and substrate that then</text><text start="769.94" dur="5.32">exists strongly medically in the</text><text start="772.38" dur="5.34">environment it is um solving a need for</text><text start="775.26" dur="4.379">Block space it is it has a strong</text><text start="777.72" dur="4.5">ability to</text><text start="779.639" dur="3.961">um uh it stays retained for a long time</text><text start="782.22" dur="3.119">that&apos;s a crucial piece of any</text><text start="783.6" dur="3.72">replicators like you both want to move</text><text start="785.339" dur="4.201">quickly in the environment but you also</text><text start="787.32" dur="4.44">want to be retained for a long time and</text><text start="789.54" dur="4.02">uh Josh Stark has a great piece on Adams</text><text start="791.76" dur="3.3">institutions and blockchains and</text><text start="793.56" dur="2.76">hardness the idea of hardness what he</text><text start="795.06" dur="3.18">calls hardness</text><text start="796.32" dur="3.72">um which is uh yeah that that</text><text start="798.24" dur="3.3">blockchains are hard they stay around</text><text start="800.04" dur="4.32">for a long time just like institutions</text><text start="801.54" dur="4.32">stay around and atoms stay around and so</text><text start="804.36" dur="3.479">yeah something like ethereum I agree</text><text start="805.86" dur="3.9">it&apos;s a great kind of keystone species</text><text start="807.839" dur="3.24">and you want those keystone species to</text><text start="809.76" dur="3.78">be</text><text start="811.079" dur="4.56">um yeah to exist in loving symbiotic win</text><text start="813.54" dur="4.859">relationships instead of a keystone</text><text start="815.639" dur="4.861">species that like um takes down the rest</text><text start="818.399" dur="3.541">of the ecosystem let me ask you this</text><text start="820.5" dur="3.06">this is a provocative and almost</text><text start="821.94" dur="3.18">nonsensical question but what does it</text><text start="823.56" dur="3.779">mean to be in a loving relationship with</text><text start="825.12" dur="3.0">another between memes that&apos;s a good</text><text start="827.339" dur="2.94">question</text><text start="828.12" dur="3.719">um yeah it&apos;s a good question</text><text start="830.279" dur="2.761">oh boy</text><text start="831.839" dur="4.201">um</text><text start="833.04" dur="5.94">I think that</text><text start="836.04" dur="4.799">when I think about a loving sofa so that</text><text start="838.98" dur="3.539">the way that I think about this is kind</text><text start="840.839" dur="3.361">of beginning with the end in mind you&apos;re</text><text start="842.519" dur="3.661">doing great by the way my question was</text><text start="844.2" dur="3.48">totally unfair but you&apos;re you&apos;re really</text><text start="846.18" dur="2.719">taking a swig at it I&apos;m taking it</text><text start="847.68" dur="3.54">seriously</text><text start="848.899" dur="4.12">what is love I&apos;m ready</text><text start="851.22" dur="3.66">um love means and my answer is kind of a</text><text start="853.019" dur="5.161">dumb answer so um so you&apos;re you&apos;re a</text><text start="854.88" dur="5.519">dumb question gets received there we go</text><text start="858.18" dur="5.339">the um the begin with the end in mind</text><text start="860.399" dur="5.88">and so the end that we want is a Co a</text><text start="863.519" dur="4.801">metastable relationship between the</text><text start="866.279" dur="4.62">three replicators between genes memes</text><text start="868.32" dur="4.86">and keems these computer memes</text><text start="870.899" dur="4.201">um AKA between nature 1.0 you know the</text><text start="873.18" dur="3.719">Earth and biosphere nature 2.0 humans</text><text start="875.1" dur="4.919">and Humanity in the nature 3.0 like</text><text start="876.899" dur="5.401">machines we want a meta stable reality</text><text start="880.019" dur="3.421">between all those where all units are</text><text start="882.3" dur="2.88">both</text><text start="883.44" dur="3.24">um uh Within</text><text start="885.18" dur="3.0">kind of for their own optimization</text><text start="886.68" dur="3.36">function they&apos;re like happy but then</text><text start="888.18" dur="4.26">also that the thing will kind of occur</text><text start="890.04" dur="4.14">until until the end of time that&apos;s what</text><text start="892.44" dur="2.88">we want and so to be in loving</text><text start="894.18" dur="4.019">relationship</text><text start="895.32" dur="4.62">essentially means to to to have a to be</text><text start="898.199" dur="3.541">kind of in holistic ethics in kind of</text><text start="899.94" dur="3.839">bentoist Ethics with</text><text start="901.74" dur="4.26">um the rest of the system to take in on</text><text start="903.779" dur="4.261">and to understand the whole system both</text><text start="906.0" dur="4.019">now and through time and also to be</text><text start="908.04" dur="4.08">taking actions that not only think about</text><text start="910.019" dur="4.44">now me but think about kind of future us</text><text start="912.12" dur="4.5">and like the the holistic system right</text><text start="914.459" dur="4.921">so Bento is um we had the NC strickler</text><text start="916.62" dur="6.24">on the Pod and that&apos;s taking us from</text><text start="919.38" dur="5.579">Naomi type of incentives to Future me to</text><text start="922.86" dur="4.2">Future us to now us and it&apos;s a bento box</text><text start="924.959" dur="3.841">of incentives and then what&apos;s metastable</text><text start="927.06" dur="3.779">does that just mean anti-fragile yeah</text><text start="928.8" dur="4.56">yeah yeah</text><text start="930.839" dur="5.521">it just means it&apos;s stable but like all</text><text start="933.36" dur="4.26">the stability is also stable okay God</text><text start="936.36" dur="4.74">it&apos;s like the second derivative of</text><text start="937.62" dur="6.48">stability yeah stable got it okay so</text><text start="941.1" dur="4.739">yeah I mean if if we speed run some of</text><text start="944.1" dur="3.12">these patterns what kind of things do</text><text start="945.839" dur="2.94">you do you think we&apos;ll see and and</text><text start="947.22" dur="3.239">what&apos;s most interesting to you within</text><text start="948.779" dur="3.42">that design space yeah no that&apos;s a good</text><text start="950.459" dur="2.88">question I think the speedrunning of the</text><text start="952.199" dur="3.241">patterns is interesting because I think</text><text start="953.339" dur="3.901">there are</text><text start="955.44" dur="3.839">yeah I think I think it&apos;s a good frame</text><text start="957.24" dur="3.539">to say that you know cryptocurrency is</text><text start="959.279" dur="3.481">speed running finance and speed running</text><text start="960.779" dur="3.36">technology in different ways and we know</text><text start="962.76" dur="3.18">that that occurs because</text><text start="964.139" dur="3.241">there&apos;s a kind of a transparent open</text><text start="965.94" dur="3.24">source substrate</text><text start="967.38" dur="4.319">um with you know open sources you know</text><text start="969.18" dur="4.68">Financial compounding open source you</text><text start="971.699" dur="4.44">know uh is technology compounding and so</text><text start="973.86" dur="3.599">I think um it feels like it allows open</text><text start="976.139" dur="2.94">source allows information to be</text><text start="977.459" dur="4.38">replicated more so you have like a</text><text start="979.079" dur="4.981">faster substrate for this Evolution yeah</text><text start="981.839" dur="3.421">and and I think I think that and and I</text><text start="984.06" dur="3.18">guess what I mean to say here is that</text><text start="985.26" dur="4.319">the kind of speed running crypto or or</text><text start="987.24" dur="4.44">rather that crypto speed runs Finance is</text><text start="989.579" dur="3.361">one frame on this the other way it says</text><text start="991.68" dur="2.76">that</text><text start="992.94" dur="4.139">but I would say something like yeah</text><text start="994.44" dur="6.06">Information Technology like computers in</text><text start="997.079" dur="5.94">the internet allow memes to Speed Run</text><text start="1000.5" dur="7.019">genes does that make sense</text><text start="1003.019" dur="6.601">yeah yeah yeah and I think so yeah</text><text start="1007.519" dur="4.68">I guess another way he says is like the</text><text start="1009.62" dur="4.32">kind of replicators go through a cycle</text><text start="1012.199" dur="3.721">um and that genes did that over four</text><text start="1013.94" dur="4.38">billion years and that memes have been</text><text start="1015.92" dur="5.46">doing it for roughly 200 000 years but</text><text start="1018.32" dur="4.68">like when sorry yeah but these so jeans</text><text start="1021.38" dur="3.179">did it for four billion years and memes</text><text start="1023.0" dur="3.419">have done it for 200 000 years since</text><text start="1024.559" dur="3.9">humans have emerged</text><text start="1026.419" dur="4.561">um but all the initial forms of memes</text><text start="1028.459" dur="5.34">are just kind of like uh like spoken</text><text start="1030.98" dur="4.079">word and and then the written word and</text><text start="1033.799" dur="3.841">the printed word and all that was kind</text><text start="1035.059" dur="3.421">of like the weak kind of like a weak</text><text start="1037.64" dur="2.939">version of memes like a</text><text start="1038.48" dur="4.38">pre-photosynthesis pre-respiration all</text><text start="1040.579" dur="4.681">that kind of version of of memes and now</text><text start="1042.86" dur="4.26">we have this kind of hyper that the</text><text start="1045.26" dur="3.299">memes are kind of in zeros and ones</text><text start="1047.12" dur="3.12">everything&apos;s connected and so we can</text><text start="1048.559" dur="3.061">kind of speed speed run it fast</text><text start="1050.24" dur="3.3">um let&apos;s just say what what will</text><text start="1051.62" dur="4.439">actually happen I think that</text><text start="1053.54" dur="3.72">The Hope and I think the crucial one of</text><text start="1056.059" dur="2.941">the crucial frames here and I&apos;ll just</text><text start="1057.26" dur="3.84">present this and then stop I think one</text><text start="1059.0" dur="4.14">of the crucial frames here is that</text><text start="1061.1" dur="3.36">what when you think from this replicator</text><text start="1063.14" dur="3.24">lens</text><text start="1064.46" dur="4.26">what it does is it takes the ego away</text><text start="1066.38" dur="4.2">from the human and it and it allows us</text><text start="1068.72" dur="4.319">to say okay wait a second</text><text start="1070.58" dur="5.52">um it&apos;s not I&apos;m vehicle</text><text start="1073.039" dur="5.161">for just like a blue whale is just a way</text><text start="1076.1" dur="4.38">for another blue the genes inside the</text><text start="1078.2" dur="3.96">blue whale to reproduce themselves</text><text start="1080.48" dur="3.36">um it&apos;s these tiny little jeans and it</text><text start="1082.16" dur="4.5">makes this huge vehicle the blue whale</text><text start="1083.84" dur="4.14">to have sex and produce another bit of</text><text start="1086.66" dur="3.54">genes</text><text start="1087.98" dur="4.62">um so too are we vehicles for memetic</text><text start="1090.2" dur="4.14">replication that these ideas are kind of</text><text start="1092.6" dur="3.62">coming into our mind and that we&apos;re just</text><text start="1094.34" dur="4.98">the vehicles for these memes to spread</text><text start="1096.22" dur="5.14">and with that in mind what we need to do</text><text start="1099.32" dur="4.5">is if we want to create good</text><text start="1101.36" dur="5.1">environments for us going forward the</text><text start="1103.82" dur="5.16">the kind of the things that emerge the</text><text start="1106.46" dur="4.5">replicators that emerge are primarily a</text><text start="1108.98" dur="4.439">function of they&apos;re all Downstream of</text><text start="1110.96" dur="5.52">the puzzles that are created and so for</text><text start="1113.419" dur="4.38">example photosynthesis is you know there</text><text start="1116.48" dur="3.059">was a puzzle from the environment it</text><text start="1117.799" dur="3.721">said look we have a son that&apos;s nearby</text><text start="1119.539" dur="3.481">it&apos;s very hot it does these photons</text><text start="1121.52" dur="3.18">hello</text><text start="1123.02" dur="4.019">um replicators down there you&apos;re trying</text><text start="1124.7" dur="4.14">to get energy try to do this puzzle how</text><text start="1127.039" dur="4.02">can you take this energy and turn it</text><text start="1128.84" dur="7.219">into it&apos;s like an evolutionary X prize</text><text start="1131.059" dur="7.321">exactly exactly exactly exactly so</text><text start="1136.059" dur="4.841">we have this evolutionary and so now</text><text start="1138.38" dur="5.64">what we want to do is create memetic</text><text start="1140.9" dur="6.06">um X prizes and those prizes should be</text><text start="1144.02" dur="4.86">we&apos;re kind of creating these niches</text><text start="1146.96" dur="3.18">um and so the classic example of this is</text><text start="1148.88" dur="2.52">just like a feed or just like the</text><text start="1150.14" dur="3.6">fortune cookie Twitter where it&apos;s like</text><text start="1151.4" dur="4.019">if you know you can only have 140 or 280</text><text start="1153.74" dur="3.24">characters you&apos;re gonna get fortune</text><text start="1155.419" dur="4.321">cookie Twitter and so what we can do as</text><text start="1156.98" dur="4.86">a species is try to create</text><text start="1159.74" dur="4.02">um try to create homes for the memes</text><text start="1161.84" dur="4.32">that are actually good for us so like</text><text start="1163.76" dur="4.52">creating long-form content or creating</text><text start="1166.16" dur="3.84">things that when the replicators</text><text start="1168.28" dur="3.7">convergently Evolve and kind of</text><text start="1170.0" dur="3.66">inevitably evolve into them that like</text><text start="1171.98" dur="2.819">the replicators that will emerge are</text><text start="1173.66" dur="2.46">actually good ones</text><text start="1174.799" dur="4.201">does that make sense</text><text start="1176.12" dur="5.04">yeah yeah I think it&apos;s a lot to get into</text><text start="1179.0" dur="3.9">but you know I think that you know one</text><text start="1181.16" dur="3.96">of the things that really is interesting</text><text start="1182.9" dur="4.019">to me is um</text><text start="1185.12" dur="3.72">that just there&apos;s probably a ton of</text><text start="1186.919" dur="4.321">different analogies from biology that we</text><text start="1188.84" dur="5.459">can get into but having just read uh</text><text start="1191.24" dur="4.74">Michael pollan&apos;s uh Botany of Desire I</text><text start="1194.299" dur="4.141">think one of the interesting ideas there</text><text start="1195.98" dur="4.86">was like you know as humans we think</text><text start="1198.44" dur="3.72">that we use the the plants like I think</text><text start="1200.84" dur="4.199">the in botany desire he talks about</text><text start="1202.16" dur="5.639">apples potatoes and cannabis and</text><text start="1205.039" dur="4.441">one other one other plan that co-evolved</text><text start="1207.799" dur="5.341">with humans but</text><text start="1209.48" dur="6.18">um you know uh that we think that we&apos;re</text><text start="1213.14" dur="4.38">evolving in in caretaking these plants</text><text start="1215.66" dur="4.8">but really they&apos;re kind of like</text><text start="1217.52" dur="5.1">manipulating us into into replicating</text><text start="1220.46" dur="4.079">them and then I wonder what&apos;s the</text><text start="1222.62" dur="4.86">equivalent of the symbiosis with memes</text><text start="1224.539" dur="5.161">out there like and and to what extent is</text><text start="1227.48" dur="3.559">a meme Landing in your brain the same as</text><text start="1229.7" dur="4.74">like a dandelion</text><text start="1231.039" dur="5.681">Landing in fertile soil right like if I</text><text start="1234.44" dur="4.859">say public goods are good does that land</text><text start="1236.72" dur="4.319">and replicate in your mind</text><text start="1239.299" dur="3.361">um and you know there&apos;s virtuous and</text><text start="1241.039" dur="3.541">then what are the externalities of those</text><text start="1242.66" dur="4.019">memes as they germinate are they gonna</text><text start="1244.58" dur="3.599">destroy your mind are they gonna help</text><text start="1246.679" dur="4.38">Enlighten your mind and how can we</text><text start="1248.179" dur="5.88">fortify our fertile soil against the</text><text start="1251.059" dur="5.221">weeds ends and make it more</text><text start="1254.059" dur="4.86">home to something that&apos;s more going to</text><text start="1256.28" dur="4.259">be regenerative uh using this lens so</text><text start="1258.919" dur="4.14">and how do you react to that well yeah</text><text start="1260.539" dur="3.661">so two two big pieces there the first I</text><text start="1263.059" dur="2.641">love that I think it&apos;s like yeah there&apos;s</text><text start="1264.2" dur="3.42">there&apos;s always co-domestication</text><text start="1265.7" dur="4.26">processes that are occurring it&apos;s not</text><text start="1267.62" dur="4.439">just us domesticating plants and animals</text><text start="1269.96" dur="4.26">it&apos;s that they also domesticate us so</text><text start="1272.059" dur="5.221">that we&apos;re kind of co-domesticating and</text><text start="1274.22" dur="4.74">similarly as you&apos;re noting there is a</text><text start="1277.28" dur="3.3">um kind of a co-domestication process</text><text start="1278.96" dur="3.599">with like the the memes themselves and</text><text start="1280.58" dur="3.599">so I think one one way that I kind of</text><text start="1282.559" dur="2.161">view it is</text><text start="1284.179" dur="2.221">um</text><text start="1284.72" dur="4.199">that for something like public goods are</text><text start="1286.4" dur="5.1">good or something like bentoism I kind</text><text start="1288.919" dur="4.561">of think as of those as kind of</text><text start="1291.5" dur="2.659">inevitable</text><text start="1293.48" dur="4.439">um</text><text start="1294.159" dur="5.38">like memetic phrases that um are just</text><text start="1297.919" dur="4.081">kind of inevitable in the space because</text><text start="1299.539" dur="4.441">there&apos;s we know that public goods are</text><text start="1302.0" dur="4.919">good and we know that there&apos;s going to</text><text start="1303.98" dur="4.86">be some version of that idea that got</text><text start="1306.919" dur="3.541">collapsed into the smallest memetic unit</text><text start="1308.84" dur="3.9">that it could be that would then spread</text><text start="1310.46" dur="4.5">within the ecosystem so as as they&apos;re</text><text start="1312.74" dur="3.66">emerged this ecosystem of crypto folks</text><text start="1314.96" dur="4.199">who are into regen and green pill and</text><text start="1316.4" dur="5.519">whatever then we knew that we were going</text><text start="1319.159" dur="6.0">to get a word like public goods are good</text><text start="1321.919" dur="6.061">um and so I think that like seeing these</text><text start="1325.159" dur="5.64">phrases as kind of like Downstream of</text><text start="1327.98" dur="4.319">the like um or like psychology</text><text start="1330.799" dur="3.481">um or like the kind of a medic ecosystem</text><text start="1332.299" dur="4.141">is I think one helpful thing the other</text><text start="1334.28" dur="4.32">piece that you asked there was</text><text start="1336.44" dur="2.94">how can we</text><text start="1338.6" dur="2.699">um</text><text start="1339.38" dur="3.419">you know how can we make it so that the</text><text start="1341.299" dur="3.421">memes that like live in our brains are</text><text start="1342.799" dur="4.86">good ones or whatever</text><text start="1344.72" dur="6.36">um and I think that that one is</text><text start="1347.659" dur="5.701">interesting I think the way that we can</text><text start="1351.08" dur="4.86">do that is</text><text start="1353.36" dur="4.679">what would I say here I mean</text><text start="1355.94" dur="3.96">um there&apos;s many many many ways to do</text><text start="1358.039" dur="3.481">this but I mean a lot of it is just</text><text start="1359.9" dur="3.659">understanding</text><text start="1361.52" dur="4.139">um how our brains are built and then and</text><text start="1363.559" dur="4.5">then trying to mitigate the kind of</text><text start="1365.659" dur="4.38">existing system so for example there&apos;s a</text><text start="1368.059" dur="3.721">famous quote by Yo Wilson</text><text start="1370.039" dur="3.481">um we have Paleolithic emotions with</text><text start="1371.78" dur="4.139">medieval institutions and Godlike</text><text start="1373.52" dur="5.88">technology and so a lot of what we want</text><text start="1375.919" dur="5.401">to do today is Embrace those Paleolithic</text><text start="1379.4" dur="3.779">emotions we need to understand the</text><text start="1381.32" dur="4.26">computational Neuroscience of our brains</text><text start="1383.179" dur="4.021">and then as we start to build</text><text start="1385.58" dur="3.839">um freaking neuralink and these random</text><text start="1387.2" dur="3.959">things to create homes that will not</text><text start="1389.419" dur="3.601">just be kind of outrage driven machines</text><text start="1391.159" dur="3.541">but instead we&apos;re kind of we&apos;re going to</text><text start="1393.02" dur="3.06">recode our brains to be less outragey</text><text start="1394.7" dur="3.24">over time that&apos;s just gonna happen yeah</text><text start="1396.08" dur="3.24">well one of the things that concerns me</text><text start="1397.94" dur="2.76">a little bit is this race to the bottom</text><text start="1399.32" dur="3.3">of the brain stem that we just see on</text><text start="1400.7" dur="4.02">the internet where like you know our</text><text start="1402.62" dur="4.439">base desires which are just basically</text><text start="1404.72" dur="4.5">like things that can be transmitted over</text><text start="1407.059" dur="4.381">the Internet is like hunger</text><text start="1409.22" dur="6.0">um rage is something that elicits an</text><text start="1411.44" dur="5.4">emotion sex is something that sells and</text><text start="1415.22" dur="2.88">so I feel like the the memes that we&apos;ve</text><text start="1416.84" dur="4.199">seen replicated in the early internet</text><text start="1418.1" dur="4.86">are just like you know it&apos;s funny I</text><text start="1421.039" dur="3.421">um I ran an online dating website when I</text><text start="1422.96" dur="3.48">was in my 20s and I remember getting on</text><text start="1424.46" dur="4.16">a call with our ad guy and he was like</text><text start="1426.44" dur="4.979">he was like yeah like the the the the</text><text start="1428.62" dur="5.559">CTA uh that&apos;s gonna have the highest</text><text start="1431.419" dur="4.38">click for this ad is like a girl where</text><text start="1434.179" dur="4.141">you can like see her cleavage like it&apos;s</text><text start="1435.799" dur="4.081">just a race to like get get your higher</text><text start="1438.32" dur="4.68">click-through rate by by showing like</text><text start="1439.88" dur="4.5">tits and I&apos;m you know uh and so like how</text><text start="1443.0" dur="3.72">do you avoid the the race to the bottom</text><text start="1444.38" dur="3.84">of the brain stem like how do we elicit</text><text start="1446.72" dur="3.66">our higher emotions and create</text><text start="1448.22" dur="5.22">cooperation across distance when what</text><text start="1450.38" dur="4.799">draws our attention is</text><text start="1453.44" dur="4.44">um things that are that are sort of like</text><text start="1455.179" dur="4.801">base either elicit like a strong</text><text start="1457.88" dur="3.779">response but maybe aren&apos;t uh associated</text><text start="1459.98" dur="5.16">with our higher angels</text><text start="1461.659" dur="6.301">it&apos;s a great question I think that um</text><text start="1465.14" dur="5.1">I think that this is where kind of the</text><text start="1467.96" dur="3.839">idea of um it&apos;s just adding in friction</text><text start="1470.24" dur="4.5">I think this is where this comes and so</text><text start="1471.799" dur="5.041">I think part of it is saying oh well hey</text><text start="1474.74" dur="3.419">us within ourselves to say like okay the</text><text start="1476.84" dur="3.0">highest collector rate is this like</text><text start="1478.159" dur="3.361">cleavage woman or whatever but then you</text><text start="1479.84" dur="3.36">can say wait a second is that like a</text><text start="1481.52" dur="3.6">value that we have as an org do we want</text><text start="1483.2" dur="3.78">that to be our thing or can we like</text><text start="1485.12" dur="3.6">um kind of push back against that</text><text start="1486.98" dur="3.3">um and I think then as you start to do</text><text start="1488.72" dur="3.66">that you can create race to the top</text><text start="1490.28" dur="3.06">Dynamics and so you can say hey wait a</text><text start="1492.38" dur="3.179">second</text><text start="1493.34" dur="4.5">um let&apos;s look at all the different uh</text><text start="1495.559" dur="4.201">dating sites and how they kind of do</text><text start="1497.84" dur="3.12">their ads and you can like look at them</text><text start="1499.76" dur="2.76">you say look at all these ones all they</text><text start="1500.96" dur="3.24">are is just like essentially women in</text><text start="1502.52" dur="2.88">cleavage and you can point it then say</text><text start="1504.2" dur="2.339">that&apos;s a bad thing or you can point at</text><text start="1505.4" dur="2.639">something else and say look at these</text><text start="1506.539" dur="3.12">ones that are more like value aligned</text><text start="1508.039" dur="3.541">and then people can start to battle over</text><text start="1509.659" dur="4.14">this new instead of just a proxy for</text><text start="1511.58" dur="4.079">Value which is click-through rate and</text><text start="1513.799" dur="2.941">race to the bottom and all those things</text><text start="1515.659" dur="2.64">you can say wait a second we can</text><text start="1516.74" dur="3.9">actually decide to create a different</text><text start="1518.299" dur="4.5">evolutionary set over here and then have</text><text start="1520.64" dur="3.779">people race against that set so I think</text><text start="1522.799" dur="4.5">that&apos;s like one way</text><text start="1524.419" dur="4.561">um to kind of push that is to kind of</text><text start="1527.299" dur="4.141">create race the top dynamics that are</text><text start="1528.98" dur="5.16">actually more value aligned</text><text start="1531.44" dur="5.28">yeah that&apos;s interesting you know um I</text><text start="1534.14" dur="4.2">was on uh the stone or I was at a stowa</text><text start="1536.72" dur="4.02">meeting which is this group of like</text><text start="1538.34" dur="4.079">philosophers that uh talk about molok</text><text start="1540.74" dur="4.2">and one of the the subjects that they</text><text start="1542.419" dur="5.041">discovered or they talked about was how</text><text start="1544.94" dur="3.78">to make molec work for you instead of</text><text start="1547.46" dur="2.579">against you and one of the things they</text><text start="1548.72" dur="2.4">talk about is taking a race to the</text><text start="1550.039" dur="2.64">bottom and being a race to the top of</text><text start="1551.12" dur="3.6">the example they gave was Elon Musk</text><text start="1552.679" dur="3.48">basically</text><text start="1554.72" dur="3.059">um going against short-term incentives</text><text start="1556.159" dur="2.941">and pouring his whole reputation in his</text><text start="1557.779" dur="4.681">career and just showing that electric</text><text start="1559.1" dur="5.1">cars would work and now we&apos;re basically</text><text start="1562.46" dur="4.02">in this environment in which all the car</text><text start="1564.2" dur="5.219">companies are chasing him to generate</text><text start="1566.48" dur="4.86">electric cars in Tesla has more of a</text><text start="1569.419" dur="4.201">market cap than all of the other car</text><text start="1571.34" dur="4.38">companies in in at least the United</text><text start="1573.62" dur="3.96">States right now so basically creating</text><text start="1575.72" dur="4.14">these like punctuated equilibriums where</text><text start="1577.58" dur="4.26">you change the the dynamic of</text><text start="1579.86" dur="3.78">evolutionary ecosystem to chase</text><text start="1581.84" dur="3.9">something that&apos;s more virtuous but it</text><text start="1583.64" dur="3.659">kind of requires these like outliers who</text><text start="1585.74" dur="2.52">I mean I don&apos;t know if the Elon thing is</text><text start="1587.299" dur="2.701">a good example and he&apos;s very</text><text start="1588.26" dur="3.06">controversial but you know how do you</text><text start="1590.0" dur="3.24">create those punctuated punctuated</text><text start="1591.32" dur="3.359">equilibriums is something me as someone</text><text start="1593.24" dur="4.74">who thinks about how to create more</text><text start="1594.679" dur="5.221">regen web3 is is always thinking about</text><text start="1597.98" dur="3.0">yeah it&apos;s a good question I think that</text><text start="1599.9" dur="3.06">it&apos;s um</text><text start="1600.98" dur="3.54">I think my main answer to it would be</text><text start="1602.96" dur="3.3">something by glove the adjacent possible</text><text start="1604.52" dur="3.96">where you have to</text><text start="1606.26" dur="4.799">um in something like Elon he knew that</text><text start="1608.48" dur="4.74">he could work with these values that</text><text start="1611.059" dur="4.86">were changing with these folks who were</text><text start="1613.22" dur="4.86">in rich people in Sanford in in Silicon</text><text start="1615.919" dur="4.021">Valley who were climate worried who</text><text start="1618.08" dur="4.38">already had a Prius who were willing to</text><text start="1619.94" dur="4.619">pay 150k for this first you know sports</text><text start="1622.46" dur="4.079">car and they wanted to look cool and so</text><text start="1624.559" dur="3.48">you can kind of start with you can do a</text><text start="1626.539" dur="2.941">theory of change kind of begin with the</text><text start="1628.039" dur="2.941">end in mind back chaining where you kind</text><text start="1629.48" dur="3.36">of move through the evolutionary space</text><text start="1630.98" dur="4.319">with each step being one that is</text><text start="1632.84" dur="4.38">possible that is then eventually able to</text><text start="1635.299" dur="4.021">like create a new category or whatever</text><text start="1637.22" dur="3.959">mm-hmm</text><text start="1639.32" dur="3.54">got it well I think we&apos;ve gone down a</text><text start="1641.179" dur="2.941">rabbit hole here what are the other</text><text start="1642.86" dur="3.059">things that information wants and what</text><text start="1644.12" dur="3.12">can we learn from that</text><text start="1645.919" dur="2.461">I&apos;m just gonna keep asking but this is</text><text start="1647.24" dur="2.16">the easiest interview I&apos;ve ever done I&apos;m</text><text start="1648.38" dur="2.88">just gonna keep on asking you what</text><text start="1649.4" dur="3.36">information was that&apos;s great that&apos;s</text><text start="1651.26" dur="3.779">great yeah I love it</text><text start="1652.76" dur="3.84">um yeah so I mean we could talk about a</text><text start="1655.039" dur="2.701">couple different things here maybe one</text><text start="1656.6" dur="3.48">thing</text><text start="1657.74" dur="5.16">that I think would be interesting for</text><text start="1660.08" dur="4.38">people to understand is</text><text start="1662.9" dur="2.7">oh boy</text><text start="1664.46" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="1665.6" dur="4.079">yeah I think that so information wants</text><text start="1667.88" dur="2.94">to replicate information wants to be fit</text><text start="1669.679" dur="2.941">with its environment we&apos;ve already</text><text start="1670.82" dur="4.04">chatted about that</text><text start="1672.62" dur="4.919">um we&apos;ve chatted a little bit about how</text><text start="1674.86" dur="3.819">information wants to and by the way the</text><text start="1677.539" dur="2.221">book is just structured like this where</text><text start="1678.679" dur="2.401">it&apos;s like every couple of pages I have</text><text start="1679.76" dur="4.019">like a big thing that says information</text><text start="1681.08" dur="4.38">wants to blah blah blah um and so yeah</text><text start="1683.779" dur="2.721">you can just keep asking that</text><text start="1685.46" dur="4.319">um</text><text start="1686.5" dur="5.44">uh information uh wants to access energy</text><text start="1689.779" dur="5.28">that&apos;s the in order to replicate it</text><text start="1691.94" dur="5.4">needs to access energy and so this is</text><text start="1695.059" dur="4.021">why at the start of when life started in</text><text start="1697.34" dur="3.78">the deep sea events it accessed the</text><text start="1699.08" dur="3.54">energy of the deep sea vents and then</text><text start="1701.12" dur="3.419">eventually yeah there was the puzzle of</text><text start="1702.62" dur="3.36">hey there&apos;s the Sun how are you access</text><text start="1704.539" dur="2.701">energy from the Sun there&apos;s like oh wait</text><text start="1705.98" dur="2.819">I can do it</text><text start="1707.24" dur="3.12">um I&apos;ve like solved the puzzle I could</text><text start="1708.799" dur="3.12">do photosynthesis now and then later</text><text start="1710.36" dur="4.439">when we got eukaryotes and we got</text><text start="1711.919" dur="4.86">cellular respiration which was that</text><text start="1714.799" dur="3.301">um yeah and this is another way to talk</text><text start="1716.779" dur="4.741">about informational stuff is once you</text><text start="1718.1" dur="5.819">get information wants to kind of um</text><text start="1721.52" dur="4.5">it wants to access energy and it wants</text><text start="1723.919" dur="4.021">to be fit in its environment but it</text><text start="1726.02" dur="3.84">wants to do that as the environment is</text><text start="1727.94" dur="3.3">changing so so at the beginning we just</text><text start="1729.86" dur="2.699">had these laws that didn&apos;t really change</text><text start="1731.24" dur="2.819">and that&apos;s why the whole universe is</text><text start="1732.559" dur="5.461">just a bunch of galaxies and planets and</text><text start="1734.059" dur="5.941">stuff however life on Earth 99.99 of</text><text start="1738.02" dur="3.84">species have died out why is that well</text><text start="1740.0" dur="3.299">it&apos;s because the environment is kind of</text><text start="1741.86" dur="4.02">changing so in order to like continue to</text><text start="1743.299" dur="4.86">be fit it&apos;s difficult and so for example</text><text start="1745.88" dur="4.14">here you have um once we got</text><text start="1748.159" dur="3.301">cyanobacteria which did photosynthesis</text><text start="1750.02" dur="2.82">that created a bunch of oxygen in the</text><text start="1751.46" dur="3.36">atmosphere and then once there was</text><text start="1752.84" dur="3.6">oxygen it was again a new puzzle it was</text><text start="1754.82" dur="4.62">like okay there&apos;s access to energy here</text><text start="1756.44" dur="4.44">oxygen is fire it&apos;s really it&apos;s really</text><text start="1759.44" dur="4.26">powerful there&apos;s a ton of energy there</text><text start="1760.88" dur="5.7">how can you design a system that can</text><text start="1763.7" dur="4.26">take that oxygen and turn it into energy</text><text start="1766.58" dur="3.18">um for the cell and so that&apos;s when we</text><text start="1767.96" dur="3.959">got this thing called the mitochondria</text><text start="1769.76" dur="4.139">and cellular respiration was able to</text><text start="1771.919" dur="3.36">like take all the energy and the</text><text start="1773.899" dur="2.821">electrons there like move them slowly</text><text start="1775.279" dur="3.841">through the electron transport change</text><text start="1776.72" dur="4.199">like um to get the energy so this is all</text><text start="1779.12" dur="4.559">say that</text><text start="1780.919" dur="4.62">um you can kind of think about</text><text start="1783.679" dur="3.901">um how the environment is changing and</text><text start="1785.539" dur="4.02">how to access energy and so then when we</text><text start="1787.58" dur="3.719">get to like the humans</text><text start="1789.559" dur="3.781">um obviously at the beginning for humans</text><text start="1791.299" dur="3.061">our the first puzzle was how can you</text><text start="1793.34" dur="2.88">kind of</text><text start="1794.36" dur="3.539">um as a human with this before farming</text><text start="1796.22" dur="2.76">how can you go across the entire Earth</text><text start="1797.899" dur="3.181">and like</text><text start="1798.98" dur="3.54">um the puzzle was there&apos;s all these big</text><text start="1801.08" dur="3.24">animals that haven&apos;t had an alpha</text><text start="1802.52" dur="3.659">predator can you kill them all and</text><text start="1804.32" dur="3.959">humans are like yeah we can we can get</text><text start="1806.179" dur="3.541">our sticks and stones and tools and</text><text start="1808.279" dur="2.52">we&apos;re just gonna kill all the megafauna</text><text start="1809.72" dur="2.52">and we&apos;re gonna go around the whole</text><text start="1810.799" dur="3.061">earth and just kill all the megafauna</text><text start="1812.24" dur="4.02">once we did that then the next puzzle</text><text start="1813.86" dur="4.38">was okay now you control everything</text><text start="1816.26" dur="3.299">um there&apos;s still all these plants and</text><text start="1818.24" dur="2.76">stuff that around you can you</text><text start="1819.559" dur="2.521">domesticate them and that&apos;s when we got</text><text start="1821.0" dur="2.58">farming and that&apos;s when we got the</text><text start="1822.08" dur="3.18">Agricultural Revolution it was like okay</text><text start="1823.58" dur="3.54">cool you&apos;ve answered that puzzle now</text><text start="1825.26" dur="3.299">there&apos;s much more humans and then after</text><text start="1827.12" dur="3.84">that I was like oh there&apos;s all this the</text><text start="1828.559" dur="3.6">next puzzle was you&apos;ve kind of done all</text><text start="1830.96" dur="2.88">the land</text><text start="1832.159" dur="3.301">um but what&apos;s beneath the land oh</text><text start="1833.84" dur="4.079">fossil fuels okay cool there&apos;s another</text><text start="1835.46" dur="4.26">puzzle to be solved we did that and now</text><text start="1837.919" dur="4.38">we&apos;re in this stage where it&apos;s like</text><text start="1839.72" dur="4.079">um can we solve the puzzle of moving</text><text start="1842.299" dur="2.701">away from fossil fuels and fusion and</text><text

Humanity has figured out how to</text><text start="1971.0" dur="4.08">pull energy out of the ground but we&apos;ve</text><text start="1973.7" dur="3.54">realized that we&apos;re not doing it in a</text><text start="1975.08" dur="3.839">meta stable way now I know what meta</text><text start="1977.24" dur="3.48">stability is it&apos;s stability and where</text><text start="1978.919" dur="4.161">the stability is stable</text><text start="1980.72" dur="5.16">um so what is the way in which</text><text start="1983.08" dur="5.5">Humanity can descend from the local</text><text start="1985.88" dur="5.88">Maxima of just having of only seeking</text><text start="1988.58" dur="6.839">more energy and climb the global Maxima</text><text start="1991.76" dur="5.46">of meta stable energy production and you</text><text start="1995.419" dur="4.201">know does information can information</text><text start="1997.22" dur="4.439">replicate towards two North Stars or</text><text start="1999.62" dur="5.1">like two goals at once or is that too</text><text start="2001.659" dur="5.4">complicated for for for information or</text><text start="2004.72" dur="3.839">humans to do yeah it&apos;s a good question I</text><text start="2007.059" dur="5.521">think that um</text><text start="2008.559" dur="5.941">so the hope now is um and the key thing</text><text start="2012.58" dur="3.66">so when you look at um evolutionary</text><text start="2014.5" dur="3.48">systems and a lot of this is just like</text><text start="2016.24" dur="5.64">docking selfish Gene and kind of other</text><text start="2017.98" dur="6.0">stuff is um uh when do win-win games</text><text start="2021.88" dur="3.659">emerge uh when do we escape the</text><text start="2023.98" dur="3.179">prisoner&apos;s dilemma and it&apos;s when and</text><text start="2025.539" dur="3.36">this is also with genes when do genes</text><text start="2027.159" dur="3.541">escape the prisoner&apos;s dilemma and it&apos;s</text><text start="2028.899" dur="4.081">when the shadow of the future is long</text><text start="2030.7" dur="4.199">and so when you know when like when a</text><text start="2032.98" dur="4.919">walkie and if I like when I walk in I</text><text start="2034.899" dur="4.02">got a beer you know a Devcon if I if I</text><text start="2037.899" dur="2.221">know I knew we were going to be there</text><text start="2038.919" dur="2.701">for an hour so if I start that</text><text start="2040.12" dur="3.72">conversation by like punching a walkie</text><text start="2041.62" dur="4.26">in the face that would have been like a</text><text start="2043.84" dur="3.12">bad a bad thing and so what I did I knew</text><text start="2045.88" dur="2.039">the shadow of the future was long enough</text><text start="2046.96" dur="2.459">and we were going to be there for an</text><text start="2047.919" dur="4.621">hour so I should probably be nice to the</text><text start="2049.419" dur="4.621">guy you know and so we as humans know</text><text start="2052.54" dur="2.819">the shadow of the future is long as the</text><text start="2054.04" dur="2.819">future lives matter kind of EA</text><text start="2055.359" dur="2.52">perspective and also the climate</text><text start="2056.859" dur="3.0">perspective</text><text start="2057.879" dur="4.381">um and so it&apos;s like effective altruism</text><text start="2059.859" dur="3.78">by the way um and so we know the shadow</text><text start="2062.26" dur="3.96">of the future is long and then so then</text><text start="2063.639" dur="4.321">we can say oh wait not only are we</text><text start="2066.22" dur="3.6">playing for energy now we&apos;re playing for</text><text start="2067.96" dur="4.56">energy later you know and we&apos;re playing</text><text start="2069.82" dur="4.5">in a way that uh the fossil fuel way of</text><text start="2072.52" dur="3.3">just like self-termination might not</text><text start="2074.32" dur="3.66">necessarily work here</text><text start="2075.82" dur="3.42">um we have to think in a longer term so</text><text start="2077.98" dur="2.82">I think that kind of</text><text start="2079.24" dur="2.939">taking into account that the shadow of</text><text start="2080.8" dur="3.059">the future is long is helpful and then</text><text start="2082.179" dur="4.081">trying to actually insert those kind of</text><text start="2083.859" dur="3.661">future me future uses into reality is</text><text start="2086.26" dur="3.54">really good so for example in</text><text start="2087.52" dur="3.24">Scandinavia they have on all of their</text><text start="2089.8" dur="2.22">like</text><text start="2090.76" dur="3.54">um government board meetings or</text><text start="2092.02" dur="4.02">something they they have a person who</text><text start="2094.3" dur="2.579">sits there and their whole role is to</text><text start="2096.04" dur="2.88">play</text><text start="2096.879" dur="3.181">um the role of the someone in 2050 and</text><text start="2098.92" dur="2.88">so it&apos;s someone who&apos;s sitting there</text><text start="2100.06" dur="4.92">who&apos;s like the voice of the future and</text><text start="2101.8" dur="5.28">so I think finding ways to</text><text start="2104.98" dur="3.6">um in general to to kind of bring the</text><text start="2107.08" dur="4.14">future to the present and to give it a</text><text start="2108.58" dur="4.14">voice is really powerful and then once</text><text start="2111.22" dur="2.76">we start to do that then we can start to</text><text start="2112.72" dur="2.52">hopefully solve some of these energy</text><text start="2113.98" dur="3.0">problems</text><text start="2115.24" dur="3.78">um that would be more in alignment on</text><text start="2116.98" dur="3.42">future yeah the scary thing for me is</text><text start="2119.02" dur="3.48">like if you look at these evolutionary</text><text start="2120.4" dur="4.02">systems you know if you get to this</text><text start="2122.5" dur="5.22">place where like a virus consumes a</text><text start="2124.42" dur="4.86">toast then the evolutionary Niche that</text><text start="2127.72" dur="3.6">happens is your evolutionary Niche never</text><text start="2129.28" dur="3.36">exists or The evolutionary process that</text><text start="2131.32" dur="3.36">happens is your Niche doesn&apos;t exist</text><text start="2132.64" dur="3.78">anymore and that is the check and</text><text start="2134.68" dur="5.7">balance on you</text><text start="2136.42" dur="6.6">um and so you know it&apos;s it&apos;s very much a</text><text start="2140.38" dur="4.44">um natural selection thing to sort of</text><text start="2143.02" dur="3.72">get over your skis evolutionary and then</text><text start="2144.82" dur="4.019">and then you cease to exist and then</text><text start="2146.74" dur="4.56">that&apos;s how uh there&apos;s that check and</text><text start="2148.839" dur="5.041">balance towards Venice stability but you</text><text start="2151.3" dur="4.08">know I don&apos;t want Humanity to destroy</text><text start="2153.88" dur="3.239">its planet and therefore no longer have</text><text start="2155.38" dur="4.26">an evolutionary Niche you need that</text><text start="2157.119" dur="4.861">forward-thinking intelligence in order</text><text start="2159.64" dur="3.66">to find that meta stability and I think</text><text start="2161.98" dur="2.94">that that&apos;s the hard part if you look at</text><text start="2163.3" dur="4.68">an evolutionary system like does</text><text start="2164.92" dur="5.159">Humanity have to it up and uh reset</text><text start="2167.98" dur="4.139">at a much smaller population in order to</text><text start="2170.079" dur="3.421">be able to learn these lessons or is it</text><text start="2172.119" dur="2.881">going to be able to do it it&apos;s so</text><text start="2173.5" dur="3.48">intelligent that it can guide its</text><text start="2175.0" dur="4.079">evolution in a way that towards meta</text><text start="2176.98" dur="4.139">stability without incurring that damage</text><text start="2179.079" dur="3.241">that&apos;s where my mind goes but I don&apos;t</text><text start="2181.119" dur="2.761">know if that brings up anything for you</text><text start="2182.32" dur="3.36">I think we&apos;re gonna I mean I I think</text><text start="2183.88" dur="3.78">we&apos;re gonna do it and this is like there</text><text start="2185.68" dur="5.34">have been some studies about how much</text><text start="2187.66" dur="4.62">how natural disasters lead people</text><text start="2191.02" dur="2.76">um because I mean we&apos;re just at the</text><text start="2192.28" dur="3.299">beginning of the climate crisis but it&apos;s</text><text start="2193.78" dur="3.12">already gonna it&apos;s already crazy you</text><text start="2195.579" dur="3.0">know like a third of Pakistan was</text><text start="2196.9" dur="2.82">underwater and everybody in Colombia was</text><text start="2198.579" dur="3.78">talking about all the rain and the</text><text start="2199.72" dur="4.92">floods and and it&apos;s um and so the more</text><text start="2202.359" dur="4.621">that that occurs the more helpful that</text><text start="2204.64" dur="5.04">is to push us towards</text><text start="2206.98" dur="5.04">um 1.5 degrees C you know um and so I do</text><text start="2209.68" dur="4.439">think that we are the lucky piece is</text><text start="2212.02" dur="3.66">that um the climate crisis is quote</text><text start="2214.119" dur="3.361">unquote slow</text><text start="2215.68" dur="3.179">um and so we might have the ability to</text><text start="2217.48" dur="3.3">kind of get over our skis and then oh</text><text start="2218.859" dur="3.301">boy take a little bit of a step back and</text><text start="2220.78" dur="2.819">do what we&apos;re trying to do as a species</text><text start="2222.16" dur="3.66">right now which is to to kind of chill</text><text start="2223.599" dur="4.02">out what we might not have that ability</text><text start="2225.82" dur="3.72">to do is with something like</text><text start="2227.619" dur="3.421">biotechnology or um artificial</text><text start="2229.54" dur="2.819">intelligence is because those might</text><text start="2231.04" dur="2.579">happen quicker</text><text start="2232.359" dur="4.341">um and if they do happen quicker then</text><text start="2233.619" dur="3.081">it&apos;s like harder to adjust</text><text start="2237.579" dur="4.321">so what else does information want</text><text start="2240.28" dur="3.78">sick Bro</text><text start="2241.9" dur="3.78">um so I mean one one thing that</text><text start="2244.06" dur="4.559">information wants</text><text start="2245.68" dur="5.1">is so if you imagine so it wants we know</text><text start="2248.619" dur="4.261">it is a um</text><text start="2250.78" dur="3.42">it wants to be it wants to replicate it</text><text start="2252.88" dur="3.44">wants to be fit with with its</text><text start="2254.2" dur="4.62">environment it wants to access energy</text><text start="2256.32" dur="4.92">another thing that information wants is</text><text start="2258.82" dur="4.98">in order to access energy</text><text start="2261.24" dur="3.82">the information itself the like little</text><text start="2263.8" dur="3.36">pattern</text><text start="2265.06" dur="5.64">um wants to</text><text start="2267.16" dur="7.14">um it wants to find its own kind of um</text><text start="2270.7" dur="6.899">uh orbit and and what I mean by that is</text><text start="2274.3" dur="5.76">um so you can imagine a fish and a fish</text><text start="2277.599" dur="4.74">um it has its own little brain its brain</text><text start="2280.06" dur="4.08">has these priors these like</text><text start="2282.339" dur="3.721">um ideas for what how it wants to the</text><text start="2284.14" dur="3.66">world and those priors are things like I</text><text start="2286.06" dur="3.36">want to be in water</text><text start="2287.8" dur="3.48">um and when a fish is out of water it</text><text start="2289.42" dur="3.72">goes whoa that&apos;s like the world is</text><text start="2291.28" dur="4.14">different than my priors that&apos;s bad I</text><text start="2293.14" dur="4.5">want to go back into the water</text><text start="2295.42" dur="4.98">um and so what we get is</text><text start="2297.64" dur="4.26">um instead of something like a and so</text><text start="2300.4" dur="3.24">what you get as a fish that like kind of</text><text start="2301.9" dur="3.6">stays in a similar orbit it like kind of</text><text start="2303.64" dur="4.02">stays in the water and so these are</text><text start="2305.5" dur="4.02">similar to these bigger orbits</text><text start="2307.66" dur="3.48">um that occur with like you know the Sun</text><text start="2309.52" dur="4.14">or the Earth orbiting around the Sun</text><text start="2311.14" dur="4.56">that&apos;s kind of a stable way it&apos;s like</text><text start="2313.66" dur="3.9">this stable orbit that&apos;s occurring and</text><text start="2315.7" dur="3.0">similarly we call it a non-equilibrium</text><text start="2317.56" dur="4.019">orbit</text><text start="2318.7" dur="4.86">um or a non-equilibrium steady state is</text><text start="2321.579" dur="3.841">that a fish is in its own version of an</text><text start="2323.56" dur="4.559">orbit with respect to the environment</text><text start="2325.42" dur="4.38">and so this is another thing that</text><text start="2328.119" dur="4.681">information wants is it wants to be in a</text><text start="2329.8" dur="5.34">non-equilibrium kind of steady state as</text><text start="2332.8" dur="3.18">it&apos;s taking as input its environment and</text><text start="2335.14" dur="4.14">let me see one of the piece on that</text><text start="2335.98" dur="6.3">which is that in order to do that</text><text start="2339.28" dur="3.9">um it needs to model its environment and</text><text start="2342.28" dur="2.22">so</text><text start="2343.18" dur="2.7">um you need to have and this is Carl</text><text start="2344.5" dur="2.64">friston stuff</text><text start="2345.88" dur="3.479">um predictive processing and things like</text><text start="2347.14" dur="3.479">that our brains are constantly taking as</text><text start="2349.359" dur="3.361">input</text><text start="2350.619" dur="4.261">um sensory data and then converting that</text><text start="2352.72" dur="5.16">to like internal sensory States and then</text><text start="2354.88" dur="5.1">taking actions against it and so what we</text><text start="2357.88" dur="5.34">have in the world is a situation where</text><text start="2359.98" dur="4.5">if you are for example the fish you&apos;re</text><text start="2363.22" dur="2.7">modeling your environment and you&apos;re</text><text start="2364.48" dur="3.54">staying in the water if you&apos;re a bird</text><text start="2365.92" dur="3.24">you&apos;re staying in the sky or for example</text><text start="2368.02" dur="2.52">if you&apos;re</text><text start="2369.16" dur="3.36">um ethereum</text><text start="2370.54" dur="3.299">um you&apos;re staying kind of in your own</text><text start="2372.52" dur="2.819">Niche you&apos;re not becoming too</text><text start="2373.839" dur="3.301">libertarian because that would look more</text><text start="2375.339" dur="3.961">like Bitcoin but you&apos;re not becoming too</text><text start="2377.14" dur="3.959">like nft stuff like Solana you&apos;re kind</text><text start="2379.3" dur="3.779">of staying in your own equilibrium State</text><text start="2381.099" dur="3.0">kind of in your own Niche away from</text><text start="2383.079" dur="3.181">these other things that&apos;s another thing</text><text start="2384.099" dur="4.801">that information wants is to be in</text><text start="2386.26" dur="4.62">non-equilibrium steady state by modeling</text><text start="2388.9" dur="4.199">its environment</text><text start="2390.88" dur="4.86">got it and and what&apos;s another good</text><text start="2393.099" dur="5.641">example of that</text><text start="2395.74" dur="4.379">um yeah so all animals do</text><text start="2398.74" dur="3.599">um the simplest version of this by the</text><text start="2400.119" dur="4.261">way is a thermostat where you can have a</text><text start="2402.339" dur="3.841">thermostat it&apos;s like I the thermostat&apos;s</text><text start="2404.38" dur="4.14">like I want the world to be at 72</text><text start="2406.18" dur="4.08">degrees Fahrenheit and then and then</text><text start="2408.52" dur="4.62">when it&apos;s 74 it&apos;s like oh no I want to</text><text start="2410.26" dur="6.0">like change the world to match my priors</text><text start="2413.14" dur="5.459">um right and so the um and so lots of</text><text start="2416.26" dur="3.839">thermostats do it fish do it humans the</text><text start="2418.599" dur="4.381">issue with humans</text><text start="2420.099" dur="4.621">is that we&apos;re so priced into our priors</text><text start="2422.98" dur="3.48">oh my God like it&apos;s good to be</text><text start="2424.72" dur="4.44">relatively priced like I want to be</text><text start="2426.46" dur="3.899">where oxygen is like that&apos;s a prior like</text><text start="2429.16" dur="3.959">a very strong prior that we probably</text><text start="2430.359" dur="5.24">shouldn&apos;t change but we&apos;re way too</text><text start="2433.119" dur="4.441">um priced into our priors around like</text><text start="2435.599" dur="3.941">wanting to</text><text start="2437.56" dur="4.44">um around like Oh I&apos;m a Democrat I&apos;m a</text><text start="2439.54" dur="4.14">Libertarian I&apos;m a republican it&apos;s like I</text><text start="2442.0" dur="3.48">think that having</text><text start="2443.68" dur="3.54">um one thing that this implies to me is</text><text start="2445.48" dur="4.379">that we as a species need to get better</text><text start="2447.22" dur="5.1">at having more flexible priors</text><text start="2449.859" dur="4.321">um because the uh this that may have</text><text start="2452.32" dur="4.019">worked when we were in kind of smaller</text><text start="2454.18" dur="4.5">simpler niches but when you have an</text><text start="2456.339" dur="4.801">intense interconnected world we need to</text><text start="2458.68" dur="4.32">have a kind of more pluralistic uh view</text><text start="2461.14" dur="5.52">on on our priors and in the kind of</text><text start="2463.0" dur="5.22">states that we can exist in got it I</text><text start="2466.66" dur="3.0">mean does does the fact that we&apos;re sort</text><text start="2468.22" dur="3.48">of stuck in our priors point to</text><text start="2469.66" dur="4.8">something that information wants which</text><text start="2471.7" dur="4.08">is that it like once you&apos;ve once you&apos;ve</text><text start="2474.46" dur="2.76">flipped a bit in One Direction once</text><text start="2475.78" dur="3.42">you&apos;ve got an idea in One Direction then</text><text start="2477.22" dur="3.3">you really don&apos;t want to be you&apos;re kind</text><text start="2479.2" dur="3.78">of seeking out things that hit your</text><text start="2480.52" dur="3.9">confirmation bias not the things that</text><text start="2482.98" dur="3.3">are true I mean information wants to be</text><text start="2484.42" dur="4.74">comfortable is maybe the the maxim there</text><text start="2486.28" dur="4.319">yeah yeah that there&apos;s a</text><text start="2489.16" dur="4.02">um yeah it wants to be comfortable it</text><text start="2490.599" dur="5.161">wants to be in alignment with its priors</text><text start="2493.18" dur="4.439">um and it is</text><text start="2495.76" dur="4.8">um yeah we we&apos;re definitely confirmation</text><text start="2497.619" dur="4.561">bias seeking creatures and and and most</text><text start="2500.56" dur="5.16">everything is and that&apos;s that&apos;s not bad</text><text start="2502.18" dur="5.22">had but it&apos;s just like when to when that</text><text start="2505.72" dur="3.0">should exist and it should only be for</text><text start="2507.4" dur="3.6">certain things like</text><text start="2508.72" dur="5.22">safety and oxygen and stuff like that</text><text start="2511.0" dur="4.859">but in theory we want information to be</text><text start="2513.94" dur="4.98">a little bit more and we want these kind</text><text start="2515.859" dur="5.521">of priors for humans</text><text start="2518.92" dur="4.38">um to be kind of more expansive and and</text><text start="2521.38" dur="3.18">and they&apos;re set um and I guess the other</text><text start="2523.3" dur="3.48">piece here is like when you think about</text><text start="2524.56" dur="3.539">you can you can think about this for</text><text start="2526.78" dur="2.819">when you talk about examples of this</text><text start="2528.099" dur="3.421">it&apos;s just like</text><text start="2529.599" dur="3.961">and back to think of like essentially</text><text start="2531.52" dur="4.319">you can imagine Christianity</text><text start="2533.56" dur="3.36">um Christianity has done a good job of</text><text start="2535.839" dur="2.941">just like you were talking about it&apos;s</text><text start="2536.92" dur="3.36">co-domestication Christianity</text><text start="2538.78" dur="3.18">essentially is a very good mod just like</text><text start="2540.28" dur="3.72">we have a model of what Christianity is</text><text start="2541.96" dur="5.159">Christianity also has the meme has a</text><text start="2544.0" dur="6.06">model of us and so it knows oh wait</text><text start="2547.119" dur="4.681">these humans they can reproduce and if I</text><text start="2550.06" dur="3.84">make lots of them then there&apos;ll be more</text><text start="2551.8" dur="3.72">of me so I&apos;m gonna make Catholic</text><text start="2553.9" dur="3.36">families you know and I&apos;m gonna say</text><text start="2555.52" dur="3.72">divorce is not legal and homosexual is</text><text start="2557.26" dur="3.839">not legal and abortion&apos;s not legal and</text><text start="2559.24" dur="3.9">so because I want more copies of meat to</text><text start="2561.099" dur="3.781">be produced um oh and I also know that</text><text start="2563.14" dur="3.18">like humans they don&apos;t really know like</text><text start="2564.88" dur="3.719">what happens after death so I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="2566.32" dur="5.1">say there&apos;s a God you know um and so</text><text start="2568.599" dur="5.161">these are kind of things that the</text><text start="2571.42" dur="3.72">um in addition to like uh the brains</text><text start="2573.76" dur="3.12">modeling things you can imagine the</text><text start="2575.14" dur="4.439">memes themselves is constantly modeling</text><text start="2576.88" dur="4.439">their environment in order to find</text><text start="2579.579" dur="2.76">um like a long-term Niche that they can</text><text start="2581.319" dur="3.721">live</text><text start="2582.339" dur="4.921">right so you know I mean there&apos;s</text><text start="2585.04" dur="4.799">darwinistic Natural Evolution which is</text><text start="2587.26" dur="5.64">how genes evolve is there an equivalent</text><text start="2589.839" dur="6.24">of natural selection for uh for memes</text><text start="2592.9" dur="6.36">and kemetics I mean like are do the do</text><text start="2596.079" dur="5.221">the memes that that confer some sort of</text><text start="2599.26" dur="4.079">memetic Advantage are they the ones that</text><text start="2601.3" dur="3.72">that propagate</text><text start="2603.339" dur="4.74">yeah so what I would say is like I mean</text><text start="2605.02" dur="4.079">so the simple version of this is that</text><text start="2608.079" dur="5.301">um</text><text start="2609.099" dur="7.02">yes any meme that um</text><text start="2613.38" dur="4.479">that that gets access to energy and</text><text start="2616.119" dur="3.781">allows us to replicate more is going to</text><text start="2617.859" dur="3.72">replicate and so that&apos;s why we solve</text><text start="2619.9" dur="3.6">farming replicate that&apos;s why we saw</text><text start="2621.579" dur="4.141">stone tools before that replicates why</text><text start="2623.5" dur="4.5">we saw fossil fuels replicate</text><text start="2625.72" dur="3.66">um and so and then we get the kind of</text><text start="2628.0" dur="4.44">second order of replication you can</text><text start="2629.38" dur="5.64">think of this by the way you can map</text><text start="2632.44" dur="4.679">um kind of uh photo synth that you can</text><text start="2635.02" dur="3.96">map photosynthesizers</text><text start="2637.119" dur="4.261">um herbivores and carnivores and then</text><text start="2638.98" dur="4.619">fungi you can map that into the world of</text><text start="2641.38" dur="4.14">memes and you can see that some things</text><text start="2643.599" dur="3.421">have direct some memes have direct</text><text start="2645.52" dur="3.839">connection to energy so this is</text><text start="2647.02" dur="5.16">something like farming or fossil fuels</text><text start="2649.359" dur="4.561">and those that the memes there are are</text><text start="2652.18" dur="3.84">the idea of a factory or a factory</text><text start="2653.92" dur="4.26">getting energy or you know domesticating</text><text start="2656.02" dur="5.04">plants and animals the things though</text><text start="2658.18" dur="4.52">moving up the um the the the food chain</text><text start="2661.06" dur="4.62">there at the mometic energy food chain</text><text start="2662.7" dur="4.6">is something like these narratives and</text><text start="2665.68" dur="4.439">these narratives are ways that</text><text start="2667.3" dur="4.559">coordinate and motivate people and do</text><text start="2670.119" dur="3.601">get access to energy but get it kind of</text><text start="2671.859" dur="3.901">one step above where you kind of have</text><text start="2673.72" dur="5.099">the natural access to energy and then if</text><text start="2675.76" dur="4.68">your Christianity you then can get um</text><text start="2678.819" dur="3.061">you can coordinate and motivate all the</text><text start="2680.44" dur="2.879">people to trust each other and do blah</text><text start="2681.88" dur="3.54">blah and kill the other people that</text><text start="2683.319" dur="4.141">aren&apos;t you in darwinian evolution where</text><text start="2685.42" dur="3.3">obviously there&apos;s only one God and you</text><text start="2687.46" dur="3.18">have to do Crusades and stuff like that</text><text start="2688.72" dur="4.02">against the other people the kind of</text><text start="2690.64" dur="5.64">these narratives are kind of a level</text><text start="2692.74" dur="5.579">above the energy memes and all these</text><text start="2696.28" dur="4.799">things are in kind of darwinian</text><text start="2698.319" dur="5.161">um both competing but also collaborating</text><text start="2701.079" dur="4.5">um uh memetic competition with each</text><text start="2703.48" dur="5.4">other yeah</text><text start="2705.579" dur="5.04">there is this um I think there&apos;s this</text><text start="2708.88" dur="3.36">this the story that I read uh something</text><text start="2710.619" dur="4.861">about like a parasite that would infest</text><text start="2712.24" dur="5.82">an ant and would make it climb up a</text><text start="2715.48" dur="5.82">glass like a grass blade a blade of</text><text start="2718.06" dur="4.98">grass and it would basically</text><text start="2721.3" dur="4.14">um climb up and just hang out at the top</text><text start="2723.04" dur="4.5">of a blade of grass until</text><text start="2725.44" dur="4.62">um the parasite was able to replicate</text><text start="2727.54" dur="4.98">and put more of its spores in the air</text><text start="2730.06" dur="5.94">and then the ant basically dies but then</text><text start="2732.52" dur="4.799">like this spreads to more more ants um I</text><text start="2736.0" dur="3.0">wish I was remembering the name of the</text><text start="2737.319" dur="3.841">parasite at this point but you know I</text><text start="2739.0" dur="3.9">guess I&apos;m wondering is like you know to</text><text start="2741.16" dur="4.56">what extent when I get a meme in my</text><text start="2742.9" dur="4.74">brain is it using me versus me using it</text><text start="2745.72" dur="4.26">you know at what point is it is it in</text><text start="2747.64" dur="4.26">control are we are we in control of</text><text start="2749.98" dur="4.32">these

maybe</text><text start="2755.859" dur="4.26">like the ant thing is kind of like a</text><text start="2758.26" dur="4.38">little bit crazy but like you know like</text><text start="2760.119" dur="3.661">have stuff Have Fun staying poor like to</text><text start="2762.64" dur="4.32">what extent is that an information</text><text start="2763.78" dur="6.36">organism that is propagating to make</text><text start="2766.96" dur="6.18">Bitcoin number go up uh and at what</text><text start="2770.14" dur="4.08">point is it using me I I guess is is the</text><text start="2773.14" dur="3.24">question maybe is there any way of</text><text start="2774.22" dur="3.899">knowing without having looking in</text><text start="2776.38" dur="4.199">retrospect like if you got more Rich</text><text start="2778.119" dur="5.401">then have some have fun staying poor is</text><text start="2780.579" dur="5.461">maybe a symbiotic relationship as an</text><text start="2783.52" dur="3.839">information organism with you but uh you</text><text start="2786.04" dur="3.24">know if you believe that Bitcoin was</text><text start="2787.359" dur="4.201">going to 120k and you know the super</text><text start="2789.28" dur="4.98">cycle will save us but uh it turns out</text><text start="2791.56" dur="5.22">that it it didn&apos;t get past 60k maybe</text><text start="2794.26" dur="4.5">maybe you were you&apos;re that Aunt that was</text><text start="2796.78" dur="4.44">going to the top of the</text><text start="2798.76" dur="3.839">um of the bladed grass yes no it&apos;s a</text><text start="2801.22" dur="3.18">great question I think</text><text start="2802.599" dur="3.421">um and and by the way I I love thinking</text><text start="2804.4" dur="4.8">of and you can think about obviously</text><text start="2806.02" dur="5.099">huddle and um and have some fun staying</text><text start="2809.2" dur="4.56">poor and not going to make it all these</text><text start="2811.119" dur="4.2">things are kind of immune reactions to</text><text start="2813.76" dur="3.72">this</text><text start="2815.319" dur="3.361">um uh the idea that&apos;s oh you should sell</text><text start="2817.48" dur="2.76">things are going down it&apos;s like whoa</text><text start="2818.68" dur="3.6">whoa if you want to sell that&apos;s great</text><text start="2820.24" dur="3.78">but have fun staying poor oh and GMI</text><text start="2822.28" dur="3.78">don&apos;t forget to hold these are what</text><text start="2824.02" dur="4.079">these are kind of memetic reacts like to</text><text start="2826.06" dur="3.96">be like oh no everybody like let&apos;s let&apos;s</text><text start="2828.099" dur="3.24">say Obviously three three you know kind</text><text start="2830.02" dur="4.92">of Olympus Dow stuff is a version of</text><text start="2831.339" dur="5.101">this too I think um I think those</text><text start="2834.94" dur="4.02">so thinking of those things as kind of</text><text start="2836.44" dur="3.86">reactions and ways for the the memes to</text><text start="2838.96" dur="4.26">kind of um they&apos;re kind of playing</text><text start="2840.3" dur="5.74">defense against against</text><text start="2843.22" dur="4.68">um you know cell pressure essentially</text><text start="2846.04" dur="3.24">um and and let me say what a note on</text><text start="2847.9" dur="3.24">that which is any kind of meme that</text><text start="2849.28" dur="4.92">propagates for a long time has that so</text><text start="2851.14" dur="4.679">for example Free Speech as a meme</text><text start="2854.2" dur="3.24">if I come into you and I say wait a</text><text start="2855.819" dur="3.241">second I&apos;m not really sure how game I am</text><text start="2857.44" dur="3.84">for trees you say you&apos;re trying to get</text><text start="2859.06" dur="3.6">into my free speech you know and so it&apos;s</text><text start="2861.28" dur="3.78">like it has any kind of powerful meme</text><text start="2862.66" dur="4.08">has a natural things that try to make</text><text start="2865.06" dur="3.18">that try to doubt it</text><text start="2866.74" dur="3.18">um they say no wait a second you can&apos;t</text><text start="2868.24" dur="3.18">doubt me you know so when I come to</text><text start="2869.92" dur="3.06">bitcoin I&apos;m like I&apos;m gonna doubt you</text><text start="2871.42" dur="3.78">it&apos;s like you can you can&apos;t tell me</text><text start="2872.98" dur="3.359">hoddle you know ngmi when I come to you</text><text start="2875.2" dur="2.82">and say oh free speech is bad you&apos;re</text><text start="2876.339" dur="4.26">like I could say whatever I want don&apos;t</text><text start="2878.02" dur="4.86">be free speeching me like I I&apos;m averse</text><text start="2880.599" dur="3.72">to doubt to your question though I think</text><text start="2882.88" dur="3.479">that the um</text><text start="2884.319" dur="3.481">the way and you can take again trying to</text><text start="2886.359" dur="2.46">take the Long View the big history view</text><text start="2887.8" dur="1.62">of this</text><text start="2888.819" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="2889.42" dur="5.88">when you think about so again and coming</text><text start="2891.819" dur="6.601">from genes to memes genes you know the</text><text start="2895.3" dur="4.26">species and individual kind of lion is</text><text start="2898.42" dur="1.919">not</text><text start="2899.56" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="2900.339" dur="5.52">is is not the the the the primary</text><text start="2903.7" dur="3.54">um uh what do you call it the primary</text><text start="2905.859" dur="2.821">um thing that&apos;s being acted upon by</text><text start="2907.24" dur="3.06">evolution</text><text start="2908.68" dur="3.84">you can imagine it&apos;s like a deck of</text><text start="2910.3" dur="3.36">cards and the deck of cards has a bunch</text><text start="2912.52" dur="3.48">of</text><text start="2913.66" dur="5.58">um genes within it each each card is a</text><text start="2916.0" dur="5.64">gene and those cards get shuffled up and</text><text start="2919.24" dur="4.68">then they get turned into a lion and</text><text start="2921.64" dur="3.78">then that lion goes and makes babies and</text><text start="2923.92" dur="3.54">then that baby</text><text start="2925.42" dur="3.659">um then has like half of those genes</text><text start="2927.46" dur="3.84">half of those playing cards that can get</text><text start="2929.079" dur="5.04">shuffled with another one and the thing</text><text start="2931.3" dur="5.46">that is from a long-term evolutionary</text><text start="2934.119" dur="4.681">kind of omnipotent perspective it&apos;s not</text><text start="2936.76" dur="4.079">the deck of cards that matter it&apos;s like</text><text start="2938.8" dur="3.18">an individual Gene that matters and</text><text start="2940.839" dur="2.581">you&apos;re trying to see like if you look at</text><text start="2941.98" dur="3.18">it through time you wouldn&apos;t even be</text><text start="2943.42" dur="3.54">able to tell which deck of cards emerge</text><text start="2945.16" dur="5.04">but you would be able to tell oh there&apos;s</text><text start="2946.96" dur="5.46">this card which is the idea of kind of a</text><text start="2950.2" dur="4.98">teeth or whatever you know and so</text><text start="2952.42" dur="6.06">similarly with memes I think that</text><text start="2955.18" dur="5.939">I kind of see it as like um you know</text><text start="2958.48" dur="4.619">that we are mostly hosts I think that</text><text start="2961.119" dur="3.661">we&apos;re super over indexed on thinking</text><text start="2963.099" dur="3.961">that we&apos;re important and I don&apos;t think</text><text start="2964.78" dur="4.38">that that&apos;s that true I think we should</text><text start="2967.06" dur="4.2">remove our ego mostly see ourselves as</text><text start="2969.16" dur="4.08">vehicles and hosts and try to think of</text><text start="2971.26" dur="3.599">in the long run when you think about</text><text start="2973.24" dur="5.4">something like</text><text start="2974.859" dur="6.421">um uh ngmi or or have fun staying poor</text><text start="2978.64" dur="4.439">that those are that the humans that that</text><text start="2981.28" dur="3.72">host those things are not the things</text><text start="2983.079" dur="3.361">that really matter in the end it&apos;s kind</text><text start="2985.0" dur="3.54">of the</text><text start="2986.44" dur="5.46">um it&apos;s this idea that there&apos;s going to</text><text start="2988.54" dur="4.62">be something uh that uh it&apos;s gonna this</text><text start="2991.9" dur="2.82">idea that you need to hold on to</text><text start="2993.16" dur="3.419">something in order to to give it value</text><text start="2994.72" dur="3.96">like that&apos;s the like from a long-term</text><text start="2996.579" dur="3.721">perspective that&apos;s my medic idea the</text><text start="2998.68" dur="3.6">like playing card the gene the meme</text><text start="3000.3" dur="3.36">that&apos;s actually the thing that matters</text><text start="3002.28" dur="3.78">from a long-term perspective does that</text><text start="3003.66" dur="4.199">make sense right so what you&apos;re saying</text><text start="3006.06" dur="4.44">is and I&apos;m going to take a leap of faith</text><text start="3007.859" dur="4.201">with this one is that information is one</text><text start="3010.5" dur="3.68">of the fundamental substrates of the</text><text start="3012.06" dur="5.82">universe and I&apos;m just a Battleground</text><text start="3014.18" dur="5.139">where means James and kemetics are bad</text><text start="3017.88" dur="2.88">selling for the future of their</text><text start="3019.319" dur="3.601">replication and I&apos;m just a vehicle</text><text start="3020.76" dur="4.5">towards that true</text><text start="3022.92" dur="4.28">let me okay there&apos;s the mic drop right</text><text start="3025.26" dur="4.44">there we should end the episode here</text><text start="3027.2" dur="4.78">no go ahead say it okay okay well the</text><text start="3029.7" dur="4.56">other thing I was gonna say was it um uh</text><text start="3031.98" dur="4.74">we didn&apos;t talk about this too much but</text><text start="3034.26" dur="3.839">there&apos;s me there&apos;s the genes which is</text><text start="3036.72" dur="3.119">for four billion years and that&apos;s the</text><text start="3038.099" dur="4.861">tree of life then there&apos;s the memes</text><text start="3039.839" dur="4.381">which are the um you know the ideas that</text><text start="3042.96" dur="3.48">spread from mind to mine and all of</text><text start="3044.22" dur="4.139">narratives and technology and religion</text><text start="3046.44" dur="3.36">um and then there&apos;s this new third</text><text start="3048.359" dur="3.121">replicator</text><text start="3049.8" dur="3.84">um and you could say comedics you know</text><text start="3051.48" dur="5.04">or you could say teams they&apos;re computer</text><text start="3053.64" dur="5.58">memes and so the the genes memes and</text><text start="3056.52" dur="4.26">keems or the genetics mimetics kemetics</text><text start="3059.22" dur="3.899">you know so that&apos;s the kind of uh</text><text start="3060.78" dur="4.559">mapping and so that the idea is that</text><text start="3063.119" dur="5.101">there&apos;s this new</text><text start="3065.339" dur="5.52">um thing uh artificial intelligence that</text><text start="3068.22" dur="4.98">exists on a new substrate that has its</text><text start="3070.859" dur="4.74">own optimization function and it&apos;s new</text><text start="3073.2" dur="5.04">form of replication and that that is</text><text start="3075.599" dur="4.141">when we think about the history of our</text><text start="3078.24" dur="3.599">species in the history of the universe</text><text start="3079.74" dur="3.599">that that is a very important moment is</text><text start="3081.839" dur="3.301">that there&apos;s replicators don&apos;t come</text><text start="3083.339" dur="4.26">along very often but now we have this</text><text start="3085.14" dur="4.26">third replicator that is emerging right</text><text start="3087.599" dur="3.421">yeah I mean I don&apos;t know if we really</text><text start="3089.4" dur="3.959">went into that but what a computer</text><text start="3091.02" dur="4.079">replicators want I mean are we talking</text><text start="3093.359" dur="4.141">about foundationally the seven layer</text><text start="3095.099" dur="4.621">stack of tcpip all the way up from the</text><text start="3097.5" dur="3.96">hardware it&apos;s the network to the to the</text><text start="3099.72" dur="6.24">packet level</text><text start="3101.46" dur="8.639">um is it okay it is it our keems built</text><text start="3105.96" dur="5.52">on on tcpip and if so you know how are</text><text start="3110.099" dur="3.421">they going to hijack the narrative in</text><text start="3111.48" dur="4.139">the future yeah it&apos;s a good question I</text><text start="3113.52" dur="4.68">think um I would kind of break it into</text><text start="3115.619" dur="5.161">three different parts so</text><text start="3118.2" dur="3.899">there&apos;s um the first part is the</text><text start="3120.78" dur="2.7">internet the second part is computers</text><text start="3122.099" dur="4.681">and the third part is artificial</text><text start="3123.48" dur="5.639">intelligence the internet is um</text><text start="3126.78" dur="4.5">the internet allows</text><text start="3129.119" dur="4.141">um like a pictures to spread and it</text><text start="3131.28" dur="4.319">allows these kind of like bits to spread</text><text start="3133.26" dur="4.62">it I&apos;m not sure if it totally counts as</text><text start="3135.599" dur="3.421">a new replicator</text><text start="3137.88" dur="4.38">um and the reason why I say that is</text><text start="3139.02" dur="4.26">because the the uh so this is the</text><text start="3142.26" dur="3.48">difference between communication and</text><text start="3143.28" dur="4.079">computation communication Ika on the</text><text start="3145.74" dur="3.66">Internet is something that moves</text><text start="3147.359" dur="3.541">information through space while</text><text start="3149.4" dur="3.84">computation is something that moves</text><text start="3150.9" dur="5.34">information through time like changes it</text><text start="3153.24" dur="5.22">and so the Internet is just a thing that</text><text start="3156.24" dur="5.04">moves information around but in the end</text><text start="3158.46" dur="4.98">the substrate is and the optimization</text><text start="3161.28" dur="4.799">function is still kind of humans so we</text><text start="3163.44" dur="4.26">were able to send pictures around before</text><text start="3166.079" dur="4.081">um and the pictures they have to look</text><text start="3167.7" dur="4.379">nice like either the woman or the lion</text><text start="3170.16" dur="4.08">or whatever it may be it has to look uh</text><text start="3172.079" dur="4.141">the beautiful sunset it has to look nice</text><text start="3174.24" dur="4.079">and that internet gives us this ability</text><text start="3176.22" dur="3.78">to do communication but this the</text><text start="3178.319" dur="3.601">substrate is</text><text start="3180.0" dur="3.319">um or the end optimizations function is</text><text start="3181.92" dur="3.419">still humans</text><text start="3183.319" dur="3.821">similarly so the second big piece</text><text start="3185.339" dur="4.801">there&apos;s computation and I think that</text><text start="3187.14" dur="5.04">computation is when you&apos;re changing</text><text start="3190.14" dur="3.419">um a pattern into a different pattern</text><text start="3192.18" dur="3.179">and this is where code comes in in</text><text start="3193.559" dur="3.081">algorithms and all that stuff I think</text><text start="3195.359" dur="4.381">computation</text><text start="3196.64" dur="5.679">the internet or sorry the the the human</text><text start="3199.74" dur="4.14">or the in Universe new kinds of new</text><text start="3202.319" dur="3.601">forms of computation don&apos;t emerge at all</text><text start="3203.88" dur="3.9">and so computers are very important but</text><text start="3205.92" dur="4.139">in the end as computers are Computing on</text><text start="3207.78" dur="5.039">stuff they&apos;re still mostly Computing for</text><text start="3210.059" dur="4.741">us as an optimization function and and</text><text start="3212.819" dur="3.361">the final kind of third bit here is</text><text start="3214.8" dur="3.299">artificial intelligence I think that&apos;s</text><text start="3216.18" dur="4.139">like kind of the most worrying one which</text><text start="3218.099" dur="3.181">is that it&apos;s not just communication and</text><text start="3220.319" dur="2.221">moving</text><text start="3221.28" dur="3.42">um it&apos;s not just a new form of the book</text><text start="3222.54" dur="4.5">or a new radio or whatever that&apos;s still</text><text start="3224.7" dur="3.72">in the end humans and kind of memes are</text><text start="3227.04" dur="3.059">the kind of the optimization function</text><text start="3228.42" dur="3.0">it&apos;s not just computation which is</text><text start="3230.099" dur="3.601">taking patterns and changing them into</text><text start="3231.42" dur="3.48">other patterns still for humans where</text><text start="3233.7" dur="4.26">humans are the optimization function</text><text start="3234.9" dur="4.86">instead it&apos;s built on this new substrate</text><text start="3237.96" dur="3.72">it&apos;s this new thing that can replicate</text><text start="3239.76" dur="4.44">but it might have its own optimization</text><text start="3241.68" dur="5.1">function and that is um is the worrying</text><text start="3244.2" dur="4.859">piece right okay so the worry is that we</text><text start="3246.78" dur="4.62">get some sort of paper clip maximizer AI</text><text start="3249.059" dur="4.581">that sucks up all the energy and knows</text><text start="3251.4" dur="4.62">how to play everyone on a faster cycle</text><text start="3253.64" dur="4.12">and they turn the whole world into paper</text><text start="3256.02" dur="3.36">clips or something like that yeah and</text><text start="3257.76" dur="4.26">that the correct yes and that the</text><text start="3259.38" dur="5.88">correct frame on on AI safety and the</text><text start="3262.02" dur="6.059">paperclip problem is not one of</text><text start="3265.26" dur="4.559">it&apos;s not purely one of like uh moving</text><text start="3268.079" dur="5.101">through intelligent design space and</text><text start="3269.819" dur="5.101">stuff like that and it&apos;s more one of</text><text start="3273.18" dur="4.679">trying to understand this new third</text><text start="3274.92" dur="5.159">replicator and how it accesses energy</text><text start="3277.859" dur="4.621">and what it wants to do in ways to kind</text><text start="3280.079" dur="4.561">of make it in alignment with us so yeah</text><text start="3282.48" dur="3.66">okay</text><text start="3284.64" dur="3.479">um</text><text start="3286.14" dur="3.479">yeah I mean I I guess like you know one</text><text start="3288.119" dur="4.081">of the sort of theories that I&apos;ve had</text><text start="3289.619" dur="4.141">for a little while is that</text><text start="3292.2" dur="4.26">blockchains are kind of looks like score</text><text start="3293.76" dur="4.68">keeping mechanism that allows you to</text><text start="3296.46" dur="3.84">create a heuristic and maybe the most</text><text start="3298.44" dur="4.679">obvious heuristic

this</text><text start="3320.339" dur="5.401">heuristic optimization engine so AI is</text><text start="3324.119" dur="3.421">an optimization game that you can point</text><text start="3325.74" dur="3.24">at a scoring algorithm and it figures</text><text start="3327.54" dur="3.66">out how to play and how to beat everyone</text><text start="3328.98" dur="4.2">else so like eventually all of the</text><text start="3331.2" dur="3.54">Bitcoin in the eth gets cornered by AIS</text><text start="3333.18" dur="4.32">that are like we&apos;re all just like pawns</text><text start="3334.74"

so</text><text start="3363.0" dur="4.559">um it feels like it feels like there&apos;s</text><text start="3365.819" dur="3.661">maybe some opportunity in there but I&apos;m</text><text start="3367.559" dur="3.54">not sure I can completely articulate it</text><text start="3369.48" dur="3.119">oh it&apos;s no I mean you&apos;re totally right I</text><text start="3371.099" dur="2.881">think there&apos;s and you could you could</text><text start="3372.599" dur="2.881">talk about this from a holistic ethics</text><text start="3373.98" dur="3.42">holistic understanding perspective

dur="3.06">capital and then you want it the final</text><text start="3390.54" dur="2.819">piece and we didn&apos;t talk about this too</text><text start="3391.8" dur="2.94">much days like and you want to be in a</text><text start="3393.359" dur="3.361">good feedback loop where it&apos;s like it&apos;s</text><text start="3394.74" dur="3.9">doing things and it&apos;s like checking in</text><text

a constant kind of feedback</text><text start="3401.46" dur="4.22">cycle with us as it uh plays that 8D</text><text start="3404.16" dur="4.38">chess game</text><text start="3405.68" dur="6.04">yeah literally hate dimensional chess</text><text start="3408.54" dur="4.5">because there&apos;s eight forms of capital</text><text start="3411.72" dur="4.02">um do you think that information always</text><text start="3413.04" dur="4.079">optimizes for more energy do you think</text><text start="3415.74" dur="2.64">there&apos;s any times in which it optimizes</text><text start="3417.119" dur="2.94">for something else at the base layer</text><text start="3418.38" dur="3.78">like I don&apos;t know say entropy you know</text><text start="3420.059" dur="4.081">isn&apos;t the increasing entropy just a</text><text start="3422.16" dur="5.459">fundamental part of the universe and you</text><text start="3424.14" dur="5.16">know uh to me entropy create like</text><text start="3427.619" dur="3.541">um I was at a Bluegrass concert once the</text><text start="3429.3" dur="3.299">artist said like I just want to grasp</text><text start="3431.16" dur="3.6">some of that luscious entropy out there</text><text start="3432.599" dur="3.661">and I was like oh creativity and art is</text><text start="3434.76" dur="3.54">kind of entropy</text><text start="3436.26" dur="4.14">um do you think information wants</text><text start="3438.3" dur="3.6">entropy do you think that uh there&apos;s</text><text start="3440.4" dur="3.54">anything else at a base layer that</text><text start="3441.9" dur="4.199">information wants uh that is more</text><text start="3443.94" dur="6.119">fundamental than energy yeah it&apos;s a good</text><text start="3446.099" dur="6.121">it&apos;s a funny question um I think um</text><text start="3450.059" dur="4.921">I think that well so the first thing to</text><text start="3452.22" dur="3.72">note here is that yeah entropy</text><text start="3454.98" dur="2.579">um</text><text start="3455.94" dur="3.36">uh yeah there are lots of weird</text><text start="3457.559" dur="2.941">different definitions of entropy I think</text><text start="3459.3" dur="3.84">that the</text><text start="3460.5" dur="3.839">um uh and I think of entropy as yeah</text><text start="3463.14" dur="3.179">it&apos;s obviously the second law of their</text><text start="3464.339" dur="3.48">Dynamics it takes it&apos;s a it&apos;s really a</text><text start="3466.319" dur="2.941">view of</text><text start="3467.819" dur="3.3">um the best framing that I&apos;ve heard on</text><text start="3469.26" dur="4.02">it is that it is a you can think of it</text><text start="3471.119" dur="3.361">as a probability distribution and that</text><text start="3473.28" dur="3.66">things with</text><text start="3474.48" dur="4.139">um with low entropy</text><text start="3476.94" dur="4.5">um have a</text><text start="3478.619" dur="4.921">um uh they have a very short probability</text><text start="3481.44" dur="4.08">distribution so it&apos;s like if I roll dice</text><text start="3483.54" dur="4.019">and it&apos;s six and six</text><text start="3485.52" dur="3.24">um wow that was very unlikely</text><text start="3487.559" dur="2.04">um and if you just keep hitting that a</text><text start="3488.76" dur="2.4">lot it&apos;s like wow the probability</text><text start="3489.599" dur="2.881">distribution here is crazy you must have</text><text start="3491.16" dur="2.22">weighted dice or something it&apos;s like a</text><text start="3492.48" dur="3.3">high</text><text start="3493.38" dur="3.84">um it&apos;s a low entropy scenario AKA a</text><text start="3495.78" dur="2.94">scenario where there&apos;s not much disorder</text><text start="3497.22" dur="2.46">there&apos;s lots of order you kind of know</text><text start="3498.72" dur="2.639">what you&apos;re going to pull out of the</text><text start="3499.68" dur="4.139">entry of the probability distribution</text><text start="3501.359" dur="4.621">versus what the universe mostly tends</text><text start="3503.819" dur="4.681">towards is a probability probability</text><text start="3505.98" dur="5.339">distributions that are more kind of flat</text><text start="3508.5" dur="4.74">um and so yeah I think that the I think</text><text start="3511.319" dur="4.02">that information and specifically</text><text start="3513.24" dur="4.44">replicators are kind of pushing Upstream</text><text start="3515.339" dur="3.541">against this desire for because</text><text start="3517.68" dur="3.179">something like humans the fact that you</text><text start="3518.88" dur="4.739">and I are having this chat over you know</text><text start="3520.859" dur="7.041">Zen caster and over a podcast</text><text start="3523.619" dur="4.281">shout out to our sponsors incaster um</text><text start="3529.079" dur="2.881">the fact that we&apos;re having this is an</text><text start="3530.64" dur="2.939">unlikely event</text><text start="3531.96" dur="3.24">um and that we even exist you know</text><text start="3533.579" dur="3.061">instead of our blobs that we exist as</text><text start="3535.2" dur="2.7">humans that can chat with each other is</text><text start="3536.64" dur="3.179">unlikely</text><text start="3537.9" dur="3.78">um and in order to to to kind of push</text><text start="3539.819" dur="4.26">against entropy and to push against</text><text start="3541.68" dur="4.379">these kind of moving to these more uh</text><text start="3544.079" dur="4.201">flat probability distributions you need</text><text start="3546.059" dur="5.341">energy to do it and so I do think that</text><text start="3548.28" dur="4.26">um replicators really do want energy and</text><text start="3551.4" dur="2.159">let me say actually one of the piece</text><text start="3552.54" dur="2.579">here which is</text><text start="3553.559" dur="3.06">um so that&apos;s one piece is that</text><text start="3555.119" dur="3.18">replicators do want energy because the</text><text start="3556.619" dur="3.301">energy allows them to push against</text><text start="3558.299" dur="3.3">um uh the natural state of things which</text><text start="3559.92" dur="3.36">is to push away towards flatter</text><text start="3561.599" dur="4.02">probability distributions the other</text><text start="3563.28" dur="5.22">piece though is that</text><text start="3565.619" dur="5.641">um there is in some sense replicators</text><text start="3568.5" dur="6.0">also in addition to energy they also</text><text start="3571.26" dur="4.859">want to be lazy and cheap and not use</text><text start="3574.5" dur="2.819">that much energy and what I mean by that</text><text start="3576.119" dur="3.24">is</text><text start="3577.319" dur="5.941">um you can imagine</text><text start="3579.359" dur="6.0">um so the first kind of factories were</text><text start="3583.26" dur="4.14">um things like printing presses and why</text><text start="3585.359" dur="3.901">was that true instead of like t-shirts</text><text start="3587.4" dur="4.199">and stuff it&apos;s because it&apos;s really cheap</text><text start="3589.26" dur="5.16">to just print bits to just print pieces</text><text start="3591.599" dur="5.821">of like letters on a piece of paper</text><text start="3594.42" dur="5.1">um versus something that requires more</text><text start="3597.42" dur="3.84">energy like something like making a</text><text start="3599.52" dur="2.94">factory that makes cars it&apos;s like a high</text><text start="3601.26" dur="4.859">energy</text><text start="3602.46" dur="6.0">um input thing and so oftentimes</text><text start="3606.119" dur="3.48">um you can imagine memes as these things</text><text start="3608.46" dur="3.06">that are trying to they don&apos;t</text><text start="3609.599" dur="3.181">necessarily want to access energy but</text><text start="3611.52" dur="2.16">they if they can also just be really</text><text start="3612.78" dur="2.7">cheap</text><text start="3613.68" dur="5.1">um so something like a viral like a tick</text><text start="3615.48" dur="4.68">tock dance or it&apos;s not really it&apos;s not</text><text start="3618.78" dur="3.42">something like Christianity that has</text><text start="3620.16" dur="4.02">these long-term access to Capital and</text><text start="3622.2" dur="3.84">resources all that all this is just like</text><text start="3624.18" dur="3.54">a cheap way to spread from mind to mind</text><text start="3626.04" dur="2.94">and so you can either have things that</text><text start="3627.72" dur="3.48">are cheap and spread to mind to mind</text><text start="3628.98" dur="5.28">like virals and</text><text start="3631.2" dur="5.159">um like low energy uh kind of desirous</text><text start="3634.26" dur="5.039">um replicators and you could have stuff</text><text start="3636.359" dur="5.881">that just instead of being high energy</text><text start="3639.299" dur="5.28">um output it just is very stable and so</text><text start="3642.24" dur="4.859">this is something like</text><text start="3644.579" dur="3.961">um a stone tablet or something like you</text><text start="3647.099" dur="3.121">know these hardness things atoms</text><text start="3648.54" dur="3.779">institutions and blockchains which is</text><text start="3650.22" dur="3.359">like blockchain is a thing that it does</text><text start="3652.319" dur="2.461">want access to energy it does actually</text><text start="3653.579" dur="2.76">need all the energy from improve work</text><text start="3654.78" dur="3.42">proof of sake in order to continue</text><text start="3656.339" dur="3.361">existing but mostly what it wants to</text><text start="3658.2" dur="3.18">just like hey I&apos;m a pattern I&apos;m a</text><text start="3659.7" dur="2.639">crystallized pattern in the world and</text><text start="3661.38" dur="2.52">like I don&apos;t really need more</text><text start="3662.339" dur="4.141">accidentally because I&apos;m just chilling</text><text start="3663.9" dur="4.8">uh so that&apos;s like another answer to the</text><text start="3666.48" dur="3.839">the puzzle like how do you stick around</text><text start="3668.7" dur="2.94">yeah</text><text start="3670.319" dur="3.361">beautiful</text><text start="3671.64" dur="3.0">well uh I think we&apos;ve been going for 55</text><text start="3673.68" dur="3.899">minutes now we should probably start</text><text start="3674.64" dur="4.979">converging and stop diverging so I&apos;ll</text><text start="3677.579" dur="3.54">just ask you uh one more thing with that</text><text start="3679.619" dur="4.5">in mind and that&apos;s what does information</text><text start="3681.119" dur="4.141">want recently

dur="2.661">information</text><text start="3691.38" dur="4.8">wants to replicate sorry information</text><text start="3693.38" dur="5.38">wants to be fit with this environment</text><text

to be fit with this</text><text start="3704.579" dur="4.441">environment it wants to be</text><text start="3707.04" dur="3.6">um it wants to get access to energy in</text><text start="3709.02"
