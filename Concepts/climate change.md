Climate change is the long-term alteration of average temperature, weather patterns, and climate globally caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activity, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. It includes both the global warming of the atmosphere and ocean, as well as changes in precipitation, extreme weather events, and other environmental phenomena. Climate change has serious consequences for humans and the natural environment, including sea level rise, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, and less water availability.
