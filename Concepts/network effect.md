The network effect is a phenomenon whereby a good or service becomes more valuable when more people use it. As more people use a good or service, the overall value of the product increases and users receive more benefits from its use. This can be observed when looking at networks such as social media, where the more people join the network, the more connections and access to information for all users. A positive network effect can make a product or service sufficiently attractive to cause a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and further increase its overall value.
