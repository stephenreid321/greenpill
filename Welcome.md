This is a Ruby/OpenAI-enhanced Obsidian knowledgebase for the GreenPill podcast.

Github: https://github.com/stephenreid321/greenpill
Obsidian Publish: https://publish.obsidian.md/greenpill

* `/Transcripts` contains transcripts of all GreenPill podcasts
* `/Concepts` contains pages for commonly mentioned concepts 
* `/Scripts` (not visible on Obsidian/Obsidian Publish) contains the Ruby scripts that supercharge the knowledgebase, including `MarkdownRecord` that provides an ORM-like syntax for manipulating Markdown files
