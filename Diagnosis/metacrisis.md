Metacrisis is a situation in which critical decision points emerge that destabilize existing systems and lead to a higher order of crises. It is a term that has been used to describe the phenomenon of leapfrogging between levels of crisis as they become further interrelated, as well as the need to examine the relationships and opportunities between different levels of problem-solving. In particular, metacrisis has been used in the context of managing institutional innovation and adaptation, as well as examining the impacts of drastically wide-spread disruption. The aim of metacrisis is to reframe issues, enabling these larger-scale questions to be addressed within established frameworks, leading towards more comprehensive solutions.
