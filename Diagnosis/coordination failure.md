Coordination failure occurs when the actions of different actors or agents in an economic system cannot be matched. For example, if two actors within a system agree that a particular outcome would benefit them but then do not take the necessary steps to achieve it, coordination failure has occurred. Coordination failures can arise due to lack of communication, disagreement on desired outcomes, or transaction costs that are too high. In some cases, coordination failure is the result of a tragedy of the commons, where the costs of cooperation are not shared fairly which leads to the impossibility of creating a beneficial outcome. Coordination failure can also occur when multiple actors have conflicting interests, making it impossible to reach equilibrium.
