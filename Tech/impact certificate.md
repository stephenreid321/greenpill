An impact certificate is a formal document that acknowledges a participant's successful completion of an impact assessment or reporting process. It is used to show evidence of impact levels being achieved within a business or non-profit organization. An impact certificate offers the recipient formal recognition of their positive impacts and serves as a form of proof to organizations or funders of the effective use of their resources. Such certificates provide independent verification that impact assessment processes have been applied in accordance with global standards and criteria.
