Web3 social refers to the next evolution in how people interact and collaborate online. It is characterized by an increase in trust and cooperation across disparate actors, driven by emerging blockchain-based and peer-to-peer technologies. The aim is to enable the coordination and incentivization of services and resources in an open, decentralized network, where users can securely and privacy-preserving manage their own data. The key features of Web3 social are automated social contracts, distributed collaboration, decentralization, and data sovereignty, as well as novel governance models and access control protocols.
