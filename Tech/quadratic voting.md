Quadratic voting is a type of voting system that allows the voter to express a greater intensity of preference for certain candidates or proposals, thereby representing the relative weight of each voter’s opinion more accurately than traditional, binary (“for” or “against”) voting approaches. It works by allowing voters to assign multiple votes to their candidate/proposal of choice, with each additional vote increasing in cost, resulting in a quadratic cost curve. This makes it harder for single individuals to dominate an election and more accurately reflects public opinion. Consequently, the consensus that emerges from quadratic voting is more likely to be truly representative than other approaches.
