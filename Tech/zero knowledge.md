Zero knowledge is a cryptographic concept and protocol developed by MIT mathematicians in the 1980s. It refers to a situation in which one party can prove to another party that they possess knowledge without disclosing any actual information. This allows the first party (the Prover) to prove they are in possession of certain data, without divulging any details of that data. This process is often achieved using a combination of mathematical algorithms and cryptographic protocols, and is useful for situations where privacy and security are paramount.
