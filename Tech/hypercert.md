Hypercert is a digital certification framework that uses blockchain technology to create secure digital records, also known as "smart certificates". This system makes it possible to instantly verify the authenticity and validity of electronic credentials and credentials-based transactions. It also facilitates trustless, secure, and immutable record-keeping for the certifying institution, allowing educational or professional credentials to be shared, verified, and tracked in real-time. As a result, employers can be certain that graduates have met all the necessary requirements, and graduates can prove their aptitudes and official qualifications to employers with assurance.
