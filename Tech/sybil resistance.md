Sybil resistance is a concept in distributed computing and computer networks that refer to the ability of the system to protect against malicious participants who attempt to gain control of the network by creating multiple identities, or sybils, for themselves. In a sybil-resistant system, peers can identify malicious nodes and either ignore them, or report them to the appropriate authorities for further investigation. This helps to prevent an attack vector known as a “Sybil attack” which can potentially allow an attacker to gain a majority of voting power or network resources. To prevent such attacks, sybil-resistant systems leverage cryptographic techniques such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake protocols to both identify and penalize malicious peers attempting to misuse the network.
