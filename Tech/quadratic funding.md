Quadratic funding is an innovative approach to direct funding to organizations, projects and activities addressing important social, environmental and humanitarian needs. It relies on two main components: an open call for proposals, where funders give a detailed description of the goals of the initiative and ask for proposals from organizations meeting the eligibility criteria; and a scoring system, where the independent scorers evaluate the applications against a range of criteria and select the winning proposals, without any influence from the donors. Quadratic funding allows donors to impact a greater number of stakeholders, extend their reach and maximize their funds with greater accuracy.
