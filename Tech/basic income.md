Basic income is an economic system in which individuals are provided with a flat, unconditional sum of money from the government, independent of their income or employment status. It is often used as a way to ensure fair allocation of wealth and provide financial security for those on low or fixed incomes. Basic income is not a replacement for existing welfare benefits or services, but rather a supplement to enable individuals to have greater autonomy and choice in their lives. The amount of the guaranteed income varies from country to country and can often be raised or lowered depending on changes in circumstances.
