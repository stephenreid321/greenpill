Regenerative finance is a paradigm of investing and funding projects with the purpose of restoring and enhancing the natural systems and ecological cycles that support human societies. The goal of regenerative finance is to promote a sustainable and ethical economy, enabling communities and organizations to progress towards a regenerative culture. It involves creating structures, practices and institutions - based on principles such as social justice, resilience and equity - that nurture life and support holistic development. Regenerative finance focuses on projects that demonstrate the ability to transform environmental and social problems into long-term, mutually reinforcing economic benefits, as well as opportunities to advance human wellbeing.
