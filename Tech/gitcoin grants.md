Gitcoin Grants is an Ethereum-based open source and decentralized funding platform that allows stakeholders to contribute, vote and control distributed grants. Gitcoin Grants supports a wide variety of open source projects, including Ethereum-native distributed applications and blockchain infrastructure projects. The core mission of Gitcoin Grants is to maximize the symbiotic relationship between funders and open source projects and to create a distribution platform where the success of open source is dependent on more than just a few large donors. By providing funders with a few clicks and project maintainers with reliable funding, traditional philanthropic donations and venture capital investments can be replaced with a more efficient and distributed funding source.
