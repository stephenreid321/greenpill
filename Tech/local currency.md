Local currency is a medium of exchange issued and accepted within a local community. It serves as an alternative to a national currency, with its own exchange rate, circulation and valuation. It is designed to facilitate the exchange of goods and services within a specific locality, thus strengthening the local economy by circulating resources among members of the community. Local currencies are typically used to support local businesses, increase independence from national and global economies, foster local sustainability and stimulate the local economy by encouraging spending within the community.
