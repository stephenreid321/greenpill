An impact network is a network of actors – such as individuals, companies and organizations – who share a commitment to a common cause or goal and work together to support and amplify each other’s efforts. It is often applied to social and environmental initiatives but can also be used in other contexts. It is built on a foundation of collaboration, utilizing the shared knowledge of all members to create an impact greater than the sum of its parts. This collective force drives positive change, tailored to the particular needs and objectives of the group, within the local and global context.
